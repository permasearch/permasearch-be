The terminal is a two-storey historic building with a four platform bays designed by architect Charles B. Dolphin. and later expanded with seven bay platforms. In 1984, the building containing the east bus bays was renovated by demolishing the internal walls, keeping the external north and west walls intactâ€”a process known as facadism.[5] An annex, located to the west of the main terminal building on Elizabeth Street, houses buses using the terminal. A renovation of the main terminal building occurred in 1990 to create more seating for waiting passengers and an upstairs restaurant which has since been closed with railings overlooking main floor enclosed with glass.
