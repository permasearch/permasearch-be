Much of US 231 throughout north and central Alabama is a two-lane route. However, from just north of Wetumpka, Alabama, southward to the Florida state line the route is four lanes. Also, the section from the Tennessee-Alabama state line from Fayetteville, Tennessee, southward to the Marshall/Cullman County line just south of Arab, AL, is also four lanes. In north and central Alabama, US 231 traverses the SW to NE ridgelines of the Appalachian Mountains as well as crossing several river valleys which provide some excellent natural scenery. Most of the four-lane segment south of Wetumpka, Alabama, to the Florida state line is along gently rolling countryside from several river and stream valleys onto the Gulf Coastal Plain.
