In May 1969, the Treasury sought authorization to eliminate the half dollar's silver content, changing it to the same copper-nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter.  The Treasury also sought approval to strike base-metal dollar coins, which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos.  Former president Dwight D. Eisenhower had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's likeness on the dollar.  The Treasury hoped that with the removal of the silver content, the coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate.[23]  Despite the support of President Richard Nixon, some Republicans in the House of Representatives initially scuttled the legislation,[24] disliking the idea of depicting Eisenhower on a base metal coin. The dispute dragged on for over a year before President Nixon signed a bill on December 31, 1970 which authorized production of the Eisenhower dollar and eliminated the remaining 40% silver from the half dollar.[25]  As a result of the delay, in 1970 non-proof half dollars were only minted in Denver and were available solely in mint sets. With a mintage of 2.1 million, the 1970-D Kennedy half is considered the "key" coin in the series, although enough were produced to keep prices modest. The Mint did not announce that 1970 half dollars would not be struck for circulation until after mint set ordering had closed.[26]
