In Europe, the Roman Empire, centred in present-day Italy, began in the 7th century BCE.[67] Beginning in the 3rd century BCE, the Roman Republic began expanding its territory through conquest and alliances.[68] By the time of Augustus (63 BCE â€“ 14 CE), who became the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean. The empire would continue to grow, controlling much of the land from England to Mesopotamia, reaching its greatest extent under the emperor Trajan (d. 117 CE). In the 3rd century CE, the empire would split into western and eastern regions, with (usually) separate emperors. The Western empire would fall, in 476 CE, to German influence under Odoacer. The eastern empire, now known as the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople, would continue for another thousand years, until overthrown by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 CE.
