Noh (能) or nōgaku (能楽) music is a type of theatrical music. Noh music is played by an instrumental ensemble called hayashi-kata (囃子方). The instruments used are the taiko (太鼓) stick drum, a big hourglass shaped drum called the ōtsuzumi (大鼓), a smaller hourglass shaped drum called the kotsuzumi (小鼓), and a bamboo flute called the nohkan (能管). The hayashi ensemble is performed along with yokyoku, vocal music, in noh theater.
