As a well-known business tycoon, Victor did a background check on Meggie, but he did not find anything that would lead him to believe that she was using him. Meggie began to work for Victor's fiancÃ©e, Nikki, as an assistant to her charity work, and she also became the right hand for planning the couple's wedding. When Meggie found out that Nikki was an alcoholic and has been sober for over a decade, she used this information to her advantage. She began to spike Nikki's drinks with vodka.
