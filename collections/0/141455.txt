On Friday, August 13, 2010, tickets went on sale for the third annual NKOTB cruise which will take place aboard the Carnival Destiny, leaving from Miami, FL on Thursday, May 12, 2011 to Nassau and Half Moon Cay, Bahamas and returning to Miami, FL on Monday, May 16, 2011. Once again, the cruise sold out the same day it went on sale, with thousands of fans on a 'waitlist' standing by for any openings on the boat due to cancellations.
