To sleep, women in the American West wore floor-length dresses of white cotton with high collars displaying decoration.[35] Various Native American people, such as the Navajo and the Mescalero Apache began to adapt the designs of their dresses to look more like the European Americans they came in contact with.[36] Navajo women further adapted the European designs, incorporating their own sense of beauty, "creating hózhó."[37]
