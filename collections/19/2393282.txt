Alice Brock has spoken very negatively of the film's portrayal of her. She stated in a 2014 interview "That wasn’t me. That was someone else’s idea of me."[8] She took particular offense at the film falsely implying that she had slept with Guthrie (among others) and noted that she had never associated with heroin users.[7] She also noted that the song and film brought a large amount of unwanted publicity: "It just really impinged on your privacy. It’s just amazing how brazen people can be when you’re a supposed public figure(…) We sold the church at that point." Richard Robbins, who did not consent to his likeness being used in the film, described almost all the additions to the story as "all fiction" and "complete bull."[6]
