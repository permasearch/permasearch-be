Face ID consists of a sensor with two modules; one projects a grid of more than 30,000 infrared dots onto a user's face, and another module reads the pattern to confirm or deny access. This generates a 3D facial map stored in a local, secured area of the device's processor, inaccessible by Apple itself. The system learns from changes in a user's face over time, and can therefore successfully recognize the owner while wearing glasses, hats, scarves, makeup, many types of sunglasses or with changes in beard. The system does not work with eyes closed.
