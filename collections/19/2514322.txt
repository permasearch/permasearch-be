According to Nail, "Kiss You Tonight" had the impact on him similar to what "Need You Now" by Lady Antebellum had. He said that it "was a song that the first time I heard it I knew I was going to record it. There was just something about it that made me remember so many songs from the past that, you know thereâ€™s not a specific thing that jumps out at you the first time you hear it you just know, 'Hey, I wanna hear that again.'"[3]
