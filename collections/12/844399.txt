Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infections.  Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses.  They are relatively harmless to the host and therefore can be used to treat infections.  They should be distinguished from viricides, which actively deactivate virus particles outside the body.
