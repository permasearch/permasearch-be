Windsor Castle, part of the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate, is owned by Queen ElizabethÂ II in right of the Crown,[239] and day-to-day management is by the Royal Household.[240] In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home.[241] As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle.[242] The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace.[243] In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States.[244] The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel.[245] While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis.[246] The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.[247]
