"Dreaming of You" and "I Could Fall in Love" were EMI Records' top selling digital downloads from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005.[95] "I Could Fall in Love" became one of Selena's most widely recognized recordings.[23][49] It rapidly became popular as a wedding song,[96] causing it to become one of Selena's most famous songs. Her English-speaking audience increased substantially as a result of its widespread popularity.[89][97][98] Amanda Edwards of Voxxi.com called it "one of the most popular Latin love songs of all time", adding that, "from her sweet voice to the genuine sentiment of the song (with a hint of sexiness if you're listening carefully), we're sold on this track being a solid standby any time of year but especially for someone hoping for romance on Valentine's Day".[99] A ten-second instrumental of the recording was featured on the 4 February 1998 episode of Dexter's Laboratory.[100]
