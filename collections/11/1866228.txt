The group is known for maintaining tight control over their career,[9] heavily involving themselves since their debut in the production of their music and songwriting, as opposed to many Korean idol groups.[192] G-Dragon is known as the member that is most heavily involved in the production of the group's materials,[37] having a role in producing almost their entire discography spanning ten years, and credited as the main songwriter for the group's earlier hits such as "Lies," "Last Farewell", and "Day by Day". G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Taeyang also collaboratively wrote "Last Dance", with G-Dragon co-producing the song.[162]
