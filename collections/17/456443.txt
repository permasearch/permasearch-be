The endangered southern cassowary and rare spotted-tailed quoll are some of the many threatened species, while the musky rat-kangaroo is one of 50 animal species that are unique to this area.[4] The musky rat-kangaroo is significant because it represents an early stage in the evolution of kangaroos.[2] Other rare animals include the yellow-bellied gliders and brush-tailed bettong.[10] 107 mammal species have been identified.[1] Australia's rarest mammal, the tube nosed insectivorous murina florious bat, is also found here.[10] One quarter of Australia's rodent species are found within the Wet Tropics.[6]
