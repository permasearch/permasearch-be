Values education is a part of Swedish schools. Whereas the formal curricula is about educating students to be competent democratic citizens by practising student participation, qualitative studies have shown that in everyday school life, values education and school democracy often appeared to be reduced to traditional disciplining with high focus on rules and regulations.[32][33][34] This in turn evokes some critiques among students.[35][36][37][38] Most research on values education in Sweden is done by qualitative methods, especially ethnographic or field studies as well as focus group and interview studies.[37][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Some studies have been conducted by survey and other quantitative methods.[61][62][63] In addition, theoretical work with roots in Dewey and Habermas has been done on deliberative democracy and deliberative conversations in schools.[64][65][66][67][68]
