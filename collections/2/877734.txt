Eaton also stars as the test driver for the second series of the British motoring show The Grand Tour,[2][17] replacing the previous first series test driver Mike Skinner.[18] James May stated in November 2017 that a large number of drivers had been tested, and that "she was the fastest and the best".[19] Eaton was later introduced to the show in the second episode of the second series, on 15 December 2017,[20] when she was shown testing a green Mercedes-AMG GT R around the Eboladrome test track.[21][22] In the Mercedes, Eaton says "Right, here we go" to herself, before starting the lap and completing the test drive silently.[23] Eaton did not have her name mentioned at all throughout the episode, only being referred to as "she", and her name was only shown in the credits at the end of the episode, credited as "driver".[21][24]
