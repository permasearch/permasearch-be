Walgreens claims credit for the popularization of the malted milkshake (or at least its version of the malted milkshake), invented by Ivar "Pop" Coulson in 1922,[35] although milkshakes and malted milk had been around for some time before. This development coincided with the invention of the electric blender in the same year.
