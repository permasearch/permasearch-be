For Block ICFs, the exterior shape of the ICF is similar to that of a Concrete masonry unit, although ICF blocks are often larger in size as they are made from a material having a lower specific gravity.  Very frequently, the edges of block ICFs are made to interlock, reducing or eliminating the need for the use of a bonding material between the blocks.
