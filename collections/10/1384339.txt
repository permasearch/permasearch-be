Twist 1: We see more footage of Josh driving to the dock, reflecting on his father, as he has finally bought controlling interest in the family business, and the next aerial shot comes up over a pot stack to see the starboard side of the CM, tower lights blazing. As Josh walks on deck, we switch to the wheelhouse to meet long-time Harris family friend, co-captain/engineer Casey McManus. Prepping crab pots not used since 2011 is a significant challenge, as is having the youngest crew in the fleet, including Josh's high school classmate (and Bering Sea Gold digger) Cody Moen.  Before they set sail, Time Bandit Captains Andy and Johnathan present Josh with a black hoodie saying "I'm the S. H. I. T." on front, and "S.kipper H.arris I.n T.raining" on back.
