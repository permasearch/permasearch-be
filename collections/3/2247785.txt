In qualifying for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, Wales were drawn in Group 9 with Austria, Denmark and Spain. The group was split into two rounds, with Wales and Austria – as the two nations that had qualified for the 1958 World Cup – receiving a bye to the second round. Denmark withdrew from the qualifying process before any matches were played, so Spain advanced to the second round. Austria then also withdrew, leaving Wales and Spain to play off over two legs to determine who would advance. The first leg in Cardiff on 19 April 1961 saw Wales take an early lead through Phil Woosnam after seven minutes, only for Alfonso Rodríguez Salas to level the scores midway through the first half, before Alfredo Di Stéfano scored the winner for Spain with 12 minutes left in the game. The return leg was played in Madrid a month later with Wales needing to win by a two-goal margin to surpass Spain. After a goalless first half, Joaquín Peiró opened the scoring in the 55th minute; Ivor Allchurch scored one of the three goals Wales now required, but they were unable to find the other two and were eliminated.
