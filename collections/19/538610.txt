Doctor Yes (Donald Davis), who appears in "Dr. Yes", is a parody of James Bond's Doctor No. When he asks questions of his four assistants, they each respond yes in their own individual languages, mainly in the order "Jawohl, Oui, Da, SÃ­." He captures Max and 99 in this episode and accidentally kills himself. When stung by an "electronic mosquito", he scratches his face with his poisonous fingernail.
