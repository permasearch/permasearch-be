Tonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show, which originated on the Detroit, Michigan, radio station WXYZ. Though he became well known as the Lone Ranger's friend, Tonto was originally created just so the Lone Ranger would have someone with whom to talk.[1] Throughout the radio run (which spanned 21 years), with only a few exceptions, Tonto was played by American actor John Todd.[3]
