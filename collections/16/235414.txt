The three Romulan generals mentioned in Star Trek canon may or may not have been Tal Shiar operatives. Velal, elevated from subcommander to general as of DS9's "When It Rains..." and "The Dogs of War", probably was not. Perhaps the unnamed Romulan general officer who rescued Tasha Yar and fathered Sela (TNG's "Redemption, Part II") was with the Tal Shiar: without official canon sources, these remain purely conjectural. General Movar (also frm TNG's "Redemption, Part II") likely was not in the Tal Shiar, as he took orders from Sela, and TNG's "Face of the Enemy" implied that no one of any rank in the Tal Shiar took orders from the military.
