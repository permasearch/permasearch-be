In the United Kingdom, the main observance is Remembrance Sunday, held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army.[36] The start and end of the silence is often also marked by the firing of an artillery piece.[37] A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.[38]
