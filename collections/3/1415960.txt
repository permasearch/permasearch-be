Western lowland gorilla groups travel within a home range averaging 8–45 km2 (0–20 sq mi). Gorillas do not display territorial behavior, and neighboring groups often overlap ranges.[6][7] The group usually favours a certain area within the home range but seems to follow a seasonal pattern depending upon the availability of ripening fruits and, at some sites, localised large open clearings (swamps and "bais"). Gorillas normally travel 5–3 km (3.1–1.9 mi) per day. Populations feeding on high-energy foods that vary spatially and seasonally tend to have greater day ranges than those feeding on lower-quality but more consistently available foods. Larger groups travel greater distances in order to obtain sufficient food.[8] Human hunters and leopards can also influence the movement patterns.
