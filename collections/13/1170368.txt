On the advice of his legal counsel, Zimmerman did not speak to the media after the shooting.[148] The statements he gave to police investigators were publicly released on June 21, 2012, when Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, published his written and recorded statements on Zimmerman's legal defense web site.[149][150][151] Prior to the release of the statements, the only publicly available information about Zimmerman's version of the incident came from interviews with some of his family members and friends and from leaks to the news media by sources inside the investigation and his recorded phone call to 9-1-1. Zimmerman maintained his public silence until he was interviewed by Sean Hannity of Fox News on July 18, 2012.[152][153] According to early news reports on the incident, on the night of the shooting and afterwards, Zimmerman described in detail for investigators what took place.[154][155][156][157]
