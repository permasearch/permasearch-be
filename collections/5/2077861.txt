West Ham's next opponents were Ararat Erevan in Armenia in the Soviet Union. Alan Taylor scored to take the lead only for Erevan's Samvel Petrosyan to head the ball out of Mervyn Day's hands. With the West Ham players expecting the goal to be disallowed, West German referee Hans-Joachim Weyland allowed it, making the game 1–1.[21] In the home leg in London on 5 November, West Ham won 3–1 with goals from Robson, Taylor and Graham Paddon. Erevan's single goal was scored by Nazar Petrosyan.[21]
