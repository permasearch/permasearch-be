It is not clear whether frequent ejaculation increases,[27] reduces[28] or has no effect[29] on the risk of prostate cancer. Two large studies:[30][31][32] "Ejaculation Frequency and Subsequent Risk of Prostate Cancer"[33] and "Sexual Factors and Prostate Cancer"[34] suggest that frequent ejaculation over a lifetime offers some protection against prostate cancer. The US study involving "29Â 342 US men aged 46 to 81 years"[33] suggest that "high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer".[33] An Australian study involving "1079 men with prostate cancer and 1259 healthy men" found that "there is evidence that the more frequently men ejaculate between the ages of 20 and 50, the less likely they are to develop prostate cancer":
