From the Middle Ages to around 1750 part of Afghanistan was recognized as Khorasan.[50] Two of the four main capitals of Khorasan (Balkh and Herat) are now located in Afghanistan. The countries of Kandahar, Ghazni and Kabul formed the frontier region between Khorasan and Hindustan.[51] The land inhabited by the Afghan tribes (i.e. ancestors of Pashtuns) was called Afghanistan, which loosely covered a wide area between the Hindu Kush and the Indus River, principally around the Sulaiman Mountains.[52][53] The earliest record of the name "Afghan" ("Abg창n") being mentioned is by Shapur I of the Sassanid Empire during the 3rd century CE[54][55][56] which is later recorded in the form of "Avag훮n훮" by the Indian astronomer Var훮ha Mihira in his 6th century CE Brihat-samhita.[57] It was used to refer to a common legendary ancestor known as "Afghana", grandson of King Saul of Israel.[58] Hiven Tsiang, a Chinese pilgrim, visiting the Afghanistan area several times between 630 and 644 CE also speaks about them.[54] Ancestors of many of today's Turkic-speaking Afghans settled in the Hindu Kush area and began to assimilate much of the culture and language of the Pashtun tribes already present there.[59] Among these were the Khalaj people which are known today as Ghilzai.[60]
