Hamilton secured his fifth pole position of the season at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, as he looked to reduce the deficit to championship leader Vettel. Hamilton made a good start, while Vettel moved up to second after Bottas and Räikkönen collided in the first sector. The race was full of incident, with three Safety Cars and a red flag. Just before the second Safety Car period was coming to an end, Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton, accusing his title rival of brake testing him, though FIA telemetry data showed that Hamilton had not used his brakes.[224] Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and swerved into Hamilton's Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.[225] However, with Hamilton being forced to pit for a loose headrest a couple of laps earlier, Vettel emerged in front and held off Hamilton to move 14 points clear in the standings. The FIA would investigate the incident further, but Vettel received no further punishment, although took full responsibility, issuing a public apology to Hamilton and committing to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.[226]
