Sometime between 400 B.C. and A.D. 100, the Arawak group of Amerindians inhabited Puerto Rico. Around A.D. 600, the Arawaks no longer lived on the island, perhaps because they had integrated with another culture or perhaps because they had been killed by illness.[4] By A.D. 1000, the indigenous Taíno inhabited the island. They called the island Borikén (alternatively, Borinquén), which means "land of the valiant one" [5][4] and later Puerto Ricans called themselves boricua, borincano and borinqueño to embrace their indigenous identity.[6] In the 15th century, the Carib lived on nearby islands and periodically invaded Taíno villages.[4]
