The object of the game is to score points as in regular rummy by laying down or laying off cards, initially in groups of matching cards known as melds, with a meld consisting of either: 3 or 4 cards of the same rank (e.g. 8♠ 8♥ 8♣ or 8♦ 8♠ 8♥ 8♣) called a set; or in sequences of three or more cards of the same suit (e.g. 8♠ 9♠ 10♠) called a run. One variation of the game requires that laying down a run can only be done starting with four or more cards of the same suit (e.g. 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ 10♠).
