The island's name was changed to "Porto Rico" by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898.[41] The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises. The name was changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931.[42]
