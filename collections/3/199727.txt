On 2 February 2016, a planning application to Hertsmere Borough Council first revealed that Endemol had applied to build a new extension to the house, which would be its biggest renovation to the house since it was built in 2002. The documents teased a second house with another garden, as well as a new exterior set and interview studio.[104] The old eviction set and eye studio were both demolished following the conclusion of Celebrity Big Brother 17.[105] It was later announced on 18 March 2016 that permission had been granted with no objections. Despite the overall extension, the new outdoor set will be smaller than before, holding a capacity of just 400 compared to 470 beforehand.[106]
