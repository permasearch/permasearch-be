The party was founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party by Michel Aflaq (an Antiochian Christian), Salah al-Din al-Bitar (a Sunni Muslim), and the followers of Zaki al-Arsuzi (an atheist) in Damascus, Syria, leading to the establishment of the Syrian Regional Branch.[1] Other regional branches were established throughout the Arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s, in, among others, Iraq,[2] Yemen and Jordan.[3] Throughout its existence, the National Command (the body responsible for all-Arab affairs), gave most attention to Syrian affairs.[1] The 2nd National Congress was convened in June 1954, and elected a seven-man National Command; Aflaq, Bitar, and Akram al-Hawrani were elected and represented the Syrian Regional Branch,[4] while Abdullah Rimawi and Abdallah Na'was were elected to represent the Jordanian Branch.[5] The congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the Arab Socialist Movement and the Ba'ath Party, which took place in 1952.[6]
