Batch files use an OEM character set, as defined by the computer, e.g. Code page 437. The non-ASCII parts of these are incompatible with the Unicode or Windows character sets otherwise used in Windows so care needs to be taken.[12] Non-English file names work only if entered through a DOS character set compatible editor. File names with characters outside this set won't work in batch files.
