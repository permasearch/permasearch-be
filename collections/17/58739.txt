Most countries have adopted a two-day weekend, however, the days of the weekend differ according to religious tradition, i.e. either Thursday–Friday, Friday–Saturday, or Saturday–Sunday, with the previous evening post-work often considered part of the weekend. Proposals have continued to be put forward for further reductions in the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.
