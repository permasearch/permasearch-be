Sharing the photo online, Kian Egan commented: "Shooting my first video today. Pretty mad. Here's a little photo to give you an idea of what it looks like." In the early hours, he also told his followers: "I can't believe I'm still awake. Up since 3.30am and I'm shooting the video for #Home tomorrow. God I need to turn my brain off! Night all x." Kian teased fans by sharing a picture taken during his album photo shoot.[30] In the music video, the handsome star sports designer stubble and casual clothing for the laid-back ballad as he sings lyrics such as 'I'm going home, to the place where I belong.' Kian wears a dark navy jacket and a simple jumper and jeans throughout the video as clips from his famous stint on I'm A Celebrity play on the wall as well as a shot of his wife, Jodi Albert. The backdrop has a warehouse feel with spotligthts and a comfortable looking brown leather sofa. At the end of the video, Egan gazes as images of his wife and child throughout the video.[31]
