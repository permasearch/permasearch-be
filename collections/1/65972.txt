The water fluoridation controversy arises from political, moral, ethical, economic, and safety concerns regarding the water fluoridation of public water supplies.[83][107] Public health authorities throughout the world state that water fluoridation at appropriate levels is a safe and effective means to prevent dental caries.[3] Authorities' views on the most effective fluoride therapy for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed; some state water fluoridation is most effective, while others see no special advantage and prefer topical application strategies.[12][16]
