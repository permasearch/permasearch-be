The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is considered to be the forerunner of the UEFA Europa League, but it is not recognized as a UEFA competition. Consequently, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup wins do not count toward the tally of Europa League wins.[57] This list tallies the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup together with the Europa League tournament. In the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, Barcelona has lost four semi-finals, in 1975–76, in 1977–78, in 1995–96, in 2000–01. Twice they lost to Liverpool (in 1976 and in 2001), once against PSV (in 1978) and once against Bayern Munich (in 1996). In all four cases, the team that had eliminated Barcelona ultimately won the competition.
