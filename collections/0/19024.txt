The French original is featured prominently in a variety of films, including L.A. Story, in which it is played during the opening montage; French Kiss (1995), in which it is sung by lead actor Kevin Kline[19] and Mr. Bean's Holiday, which uses a recording of Trenet himself in its final scene. It also is played in the last episode of White Collar (TV series) named AÃº Revoir started on a record player by Mozzie and then it plays over Neal Caffrey cracking a safe and Neal Caffrey walking through the streets of Paris. The song is sung in the French documentary film Blood of the Beasts (1949). Julio Iglesias' 1976 live recording is used instead of dialogue and other sounds (including a gun shot) during the last three and a half minutes of the 2011 British spy-film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, directed by Tomas Alfredson. The film and the song both end in the same moment (credit credentials aside). It is performed in the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997) by Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. The Trenet recording is heard over the end credits of an episode of The Simpsons titled "The Squirt and the Whale".[2][20][21][22][23][24][25]
