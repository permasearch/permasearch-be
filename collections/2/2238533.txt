A true family man, Reese's mother Annie Belinda Manifold (1854â€“1935) as well as her two sisters, Elizabeth Turner Manifold (1846-1910) and Mary Collins Manifold (1847-1933), lived with him for the rest of their lives. At least 20 family members were present during a typical Reese family supper and sometimes more than 40 people were present when friends and relatives were invited to join them.[4]
