In 1909, William Howard Taft expanded the building southward, covering the tennis court. He placed the first Oval Office at the center of the addition's south facade, reminiscent of the oval rooms of the White House.[6] Later, at the outset of his presidency, Herbert Hoover rebuilt the West Wing, excavating a partial basement, and supporting it with structural steel. The completed building lasted less than seven months.[9] On December 24, 1929, the West Wing was significantly damaged by an electrical fire.[2] Hoover rebuilt it, and added air-conditioning.
