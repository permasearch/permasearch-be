"Insomnia" was re-mixed and re-released in 2005 after the re-entry of the 1996 single into the UK Singles Chart at number 48. This was partly because of Faithless releasing their greatest hits album. The re-mix was not used on the greatest hits with the Monster Mix being the version which featured on the album. The re-mixed version reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart.
