In many multivalentsupramolecular systems[25] direct interaction between bound ligands can occur, which can lead to large cooperativities. Most common is such a direct interaction between ions in receptors for ion-pairs.[26][27] This cooperatitiy is often also referred to as allostery, even though conformational changes here are not necessarily triggering binding events.
