On 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory.[51] State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres.[52] Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted.[52] Latvia, then a puppet government, was headed by Augusts Kirhen≈°teins.[53] The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.
