Chiara Jude Berti was a 25-year-old marketing representative from New York City.[2] While in the house, Chiara had a flirtatious and somewhat romantic relationship with Roddy. She and Roddy were a part of the 'Couples Alliance', along with Lisa and Eric. Chiara was very open about her sex life, and often teased HouseGuest Jason about being a virgin. She did not get along well with Amy, and didn't have a good relationship with Josh while in the house. Chiara won the fourth Power of Veto competition, and chose not to use it. She was the fifth Head of Household, and nominated Josh and Roddy for eviction, with the former being evicted. Chiara annoyed her fellow HouseGuests after her HoH win, which ultimately led to her nomination and subsequent eviction the following week on Day 48. She came in eighth place, and voted for Lisa to win. Since Big Brother 3, Chiara has gotten married and had two children.
