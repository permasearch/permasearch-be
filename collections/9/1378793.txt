There is a yearly 45-day ban on fishery with motorboats in the region.[86] The fishing ban for the year 2012 was effective during the months of Aprilâ€“May.[86][87] The jetty at Rameswaram is the largest landing centre for fishing boats in the region and it usually comes alive after the ban, with the arrival of fishermen, boat captains, shore workers and others from their native places.[87]
