The Xbox 360 Elite has also been configured with a 250 GB hard disk drive and two wireless controllers on special limited editions of the console. Also referred to as the Xbox 360 Super Elite,[50] the console retailed at US$399.99, £249.99 and A$599.00[51] as of November 10, 2009. A Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 bundle included a special limited-edition black console featuring Modern Warfare 2 branding.
