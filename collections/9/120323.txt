The owners manual for the cloth bag equipped machines recommended that the cloth bag be emptied after cleaning had been finished, to avoid dirt, fungus and bacteria from setting in the fibers of the bag, and preparing the machine for the next time. The cloth bag can be laundered periodically, if necessary. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. The disposable paper bag provided a protective barrier against the interior surface of the cloth bag, and offered the convenience of storing the cleaner when finished, and not requiring that the bag be emptied every time. When the Heritage II was introduced in 1984, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and the "Sani-Em-Tor" became the "Mini-Em-Tor" which no longer used a removable lid on the bottom but still trapped larger, heavier objects. In 1993, the disposable paper bags filtration effectiveness was upgraded, and was labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns, while the cotton cloth bag traps any remaining particles that pass through.[5] Starting with the Ultimate G Diamond Edition, the disposable paper bag was upgraded to HEPA standards.
