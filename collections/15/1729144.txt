After the Second World War the British Army was significantly reduced in size, although National Service continued until 1960.[63] This period saw decolonisation begin with the partition and independence of India and Pakistan, followed by the independence of British colonies in Africa and Asia. Although the British Army was a major participant in Korea in the early 1950s[63] and Suez in 1956,[64] during this period Britain's role in world events was reduced and the army was downsized.[65] The British Army of the Rhine, consisting of I (BR) Corps, remained in Germany as a bulwark against Soviet invasion.[66] The Cold War continued, with significant technological advances in warfare, and the army saw the introduction of new weapons systems.[67] Despite the decline of the British Empire, the army was engaged in Aden,[68] Indonesia, Cyprus,[68] Kenya[68] and Malaya.[69] In 1982, the British Army and the Royal Marines helped liberate the Falkland Islands during the conflict with Argentina after that country's invasion of the British territory.[70]
