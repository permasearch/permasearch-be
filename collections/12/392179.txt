According to the Western Church, "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants",[289] and the Eastern Church teaches that "by these fruits and this burden we do not understand [actual] sin".[287] The Orthodox[citation needed] and the Catholics[290] believe that people inherit only the spiritual sickness (in which all suffer and sin) of Adam and Eve, caused by their ancestral sin (what has flowed to them), a sickness leaving them weakened in their powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin.[290]
