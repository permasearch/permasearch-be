The criminologist Thorsten Sellin, in his book Slavery and the Penal System (1976), wrote that the sole aim of convict leasing “was financial profit to the lessees who exploited the labor of the prisoners to the fullest, and to the government which sold the convicts to the lessees.”[8] The practice became widespread and was used to supply labor to farming, rail road, mining, and logging operations throughout the South.
