Like many turtles, terrapin have temperature dependent sex determination, meaning that the sex of hatchlings is the result of incubation temperature. Females can lay up to three clutches of eggs/year in the wild,[29] and up to five clutches/year in captivity.[30] It is not known how often they may skip reproduction, so true clutch frequency is unknown.
