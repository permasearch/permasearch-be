Kodak's EK and Kodamatic series cameras accepted a Kodak developed integral instant film, similar to- but incompatible with- Polaroid's SX-70 film. The film was chemically similar to Polaroid's with the exception that the negative was exposed from the rear and the dye/developers diffused to the front of the photogragh. This alleviated the need for a mirror to reverse the image before it struck the negative.
