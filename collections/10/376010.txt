Due to the predicted short half-lives, the GSI team used new "fast" electronics capable of registering decay events within microseconds.[35] No ununennium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 70 fb.[38] The predicted actual cross-section is around 40 fb, which is at the limits of current technology.[36]
