Players who pre-ordered the game could receive the Ripper, an additional Magnum Opus design.[72] The Ripper, a steelbook, collector's box, mini-license plate and Blu-ray copy of Mad Max: Fury Road were included in the Post-Apocalypse Edition.[73] PlayStation 4-version purchasers could access a Road Warrior Survival Kit,[74] with twelve hood ornaments for the Magnum Opus,[75] exclusively until 30 November 2015.[76] To promote Mad Max, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment sponsored launch events. In Australia, the company invited artists to create artwork on their vehicles with dust.[77] They joined Uber for a Seattle promotion in which Uber users could access a free ride "straight from the post-apocalypse". The offer was free, since "dollars are worthless in the wasteland".[78]
