NATO increasingly saw Russia as an adversary,[472] though officials hoped this would be temporary.[citation needed] Initial deployments in March and early April were restricted to increased air force monitoring and training in the Baltics and Poland, and single ships in the Black Sea.[472][473] On 16 April, officials announced the deployment of ships to the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, and increasing exercises in "Eastern Europe". The measures were apparently limited so as not to appear aggressive.[474] Leaders emphasized that the conflict was not a new Cold War[475][476] but some analysts disagreed.[476][477] Others supported applying George F. Kennan's concept of containment to possible Russian expansion.[478][479] Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said,  "We are enduring a drift of disengagement in world affairs. As we pull back, Russia is pushing forward. I worry about the new nationalism that Putin has unleashed and understand that many young Russians also embrace these extremist ideas."[480]
