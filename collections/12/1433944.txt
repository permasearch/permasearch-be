As one of the last things former team president Phil Jackson would do for the Knicks, he looked to oversee the prospects the team had for the New York Knicks. One of the more dramatic points of the team's draft prowess came nights before the draft began, where Jackson said he was looking to offer star player Kristaps Porziņģis (who was feeling very discouraged about the direction the team was taking around this time) to either the Phoenix Suns or Boston Celtics in exchange for the opportunity to also draft coveted small forward Josh Jackson.[3] Rumors of Jackson also trying to obtain point guard Lonzo Ball from the Los Angeles Lakers would also crop up months after the draft concluded.[4] However, after the Knicks ultimately failed to gain another draft pick to join their own first round selection, they would stick around with Kristaps and the three selections they still had back when their previous season concluded. For their only first round pick, the Knicks would select the French/Belgian point guard Frank Ntilikina, who last played for the SIG Strasbourg in France's LNB Pro A. As for their two second round draft picks (the first being acquired from Chicago and the second from Houston), New York would use them on senior shooting guard Damyean Dotson from the University of Houston and Serbian point guard Ognjen Jaramaz from the Mega Leks. After the failed attempt to trade their star center, Jackson would ultimately be terminated from his position on June 28, 2017.[5]
