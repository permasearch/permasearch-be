When Special Counsel learned of Reese's recent arrest, Special Counsel instructed him to kill him and the other three people arrested. Following the instruction, he pulled out a gun in front of a group of policemen and shot into the air several times. He was arrested and taken to Rikers Penitentiary where he managed to kill Brian Kelly, one of the four men who were arrested on suspicion of being "The Man in the Suit". He attempted to kill Reese too, but Elias stopped him before he had a chance to do so ("Prisoner's Dilemma").
