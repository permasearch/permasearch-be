With his Dedication, Dryden attempts to restore Danby and King Charlesâ€™ relationship. To achieve this goal, Dryden uses biographical information about his patron to highlight the noble aspects of Danby's career. In the Dedication, Dryden discusses how Danby managed to bring order to the chaotic treasury department he inherited. While Dryden does celebrate Danby's character strengths, he also uses the Dedication to offer Danby advice, demonstrating his own authority at being able to advise the Lord Treasurer. For example, Dryden critiques Danby's habit of conforming to the pressures of his inferiors and surrendering some of his political aspirations in the name of bureaucracy.
