During the day the Mexican army tried to block the irrigation ditch leading into the Alamo. Texian Green Jameson tasked the men in the Alamo with finishing a well at the south end of the plaza. Although the men hit water, they weakened an earth and timber parapet by the low barracks; the mound collapsed, leaving no way to fire safely over that wall.[101] The same day Texians spotted a Mexican general surrounded by aides and dragoons and fired, but did not hit any of them.[79] The Texians did not realize it was Santa Anna.[76] [102]
