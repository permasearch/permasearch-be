Tail pond dam /weir located 14Â km downstream of Srisailam dam is under advanced stage of construction to hold the water released by the hydro turbines and later pump back into the Srisailam reservoir by operating the turbines in pump mode.[5] The weir portion got breached in November 2015 unable to withstand the normal water release from the hydro power stations.[6]
