The signal strength of radio waves decreases the farther they travel from the transmitter, so a radio station can only be received within a limited range of its transmitter.   The range depends on the power of the transmitter,the sensitivity of the receiver, atmospheric and internal noise,  as well as any geographical obstructions such as hills between transmitter and receiver.  AM broadcast band radio waves travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the Earth, so AM radio stations can be reliably received at hundreds of miles distance.  Due to their higher frequency, FM band radio signals cannot  travel far beyond the visual horizon; limiting reception distance to about 40 miles (64 km), and can be blocked by hills between the transmitter and receiver.  However FM radio is less susceptible to interference from radio noise (RFI, sferics, static) and has higher fidelity; better frequency response and less audio distortion, than AM.   So in many countries serious music is only broadcast by FM stations, and AM stations specialize in radio news, talk radio, and sports.   Like FM, DAB signals travel by line of sight so reception distances are limited by the visual horizon to about 30-40 miles (48-64 km).
