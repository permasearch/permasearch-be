Ghiyas ud din Balban (reigned: 1266–1287) (Urdu: غیاث الدین بلبن‎‎) was the ninth sultan of the Mamluk dynasty of Delhi. Ghiyas ud Din was the wazir and heir of the last Shamsi Sultan, Nasir ud-Din. He reduced the power of the treacherous nobility and heightened the stature of the sultan. In spite of having only few military achievements, he was the most powerful ruler of the sultanate between Shamsuddin Iltutmish and Alauddin Khalji.
