Her husband's (Steve Klein) violent characteristics come to light, and the team takes the case against him to their county attorney. An arrest warrant is issued, and Steve is arrested. In February 2017, Steve pleaded guilty to willful injury causing serious injury, second-degree arson, and suborning perjury, although he was originally charged with first-degree murder. He was sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison.[58]
