"Jeremy" is based on two different true stories. The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, Texas who shot himself in front of his teacher and his second period English class of 30 students on the morning of January 8, 1991.[2][7] In a 2009 interview, Vedder said that he felt "the need to take that small article and make something of itâ€”to give that action, to give it reaction, to give it more importance."[8]
