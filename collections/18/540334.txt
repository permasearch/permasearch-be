Inara completes her task and prepares to return to the ship. When Fess expresses puzzlement at not feeling different, she explains to him that being a man is about being old enough to ask what makes him a man rather than about sex. Somewhat later, Inara learns from Fess that Jayne is about to be captured and tried, and that the ship has been "land-locked". He tells her that he would rather Jayne escape.
