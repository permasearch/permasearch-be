Many French soldiers sympathized with the masses from which they were drawn, and increasing numbers deserted during 1789. The bulk of the rank and file of the Gardes Fran√ßaises: the largest regiment of the maison militaire du roi de France and the permanent garrison of Paris, refused to obey their officers at a crucial point in the early stages of the Revolution. Some Gardes joined with the Parisian mob on July 14, 1789 and participated in the storming of the Bastille, the medieval fortress-prison thought of as a symbol of governmental repression.
