In the UK, "Say You Love Me" was the fourth single from the Fleetwood Mac album, but the first to chart, where it peaked at number 40 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1976. In Canada, Shirley Eikhard covered "Say You Love Me" and released it as a single several weeks in advance of Fleetwood Mac in early June 1976. Eikhard took the song into the Canadian top 40, peaking at number 34; Fleetwood Mac's version, released only a few weeks later, peaked at 29 in September.
