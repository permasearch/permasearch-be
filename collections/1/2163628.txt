The media anticipated that "Jack Rockefeller's saloon and dance hall" would become a major draw for the elite and the famous.[20] In the decade following its opening, the Rainbow Room had hosted former Spanish queen Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg; Norwegian Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha; and Swedish Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf and Crown Princess Louise.[26] The Rainbow Room became frequented by those who were both wealthy and worthy of society reporting.[27] The author Daniel Okrent writes that the diners at the Rainbow Room were representative of the uncommon, separated from "the masses" by "a price structure that required a trust fund and a dress code that required white tie."[18] Formal dress was required except on Sundays, each meal cost $3.50[21] (equivalent to $64 in 2017[28]), and the restaurant even had an exclusive bank of elevators from the lobby.[21] Dinners stretched from 6:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. the next day.[21] In contrast, the Rainbow Grill across the hall had a "black tie" dress code with "white linen acceptable in the summer."[29] The Rainbow Grill, which opened in 1935,[11] was a somewhat less expensive restaurant with an à la carte menu and its own celebrations on major holidays.[30]
