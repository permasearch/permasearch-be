The rivalry held national championship implications over each of the following seasons, with both teams entering the contests ranked in the top 10 every year.  Though they were not always the favorite, Florida won five straight against Tennessee from 1993 to 1997, winning four SEC titles and a consensus national championship in 1996. The 1994, 1995, and 1996 contests featured match-ups between starting quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Peyton Manning, who never beat Florida during his celebrated college career. But though Florida beat Tennessee in 1997, upset losses to LSU and Georgia propelled Tennessee to their own SEC championship in Manning's senior year.  Tennessee broke Florida's winning streak in 1998 with a 20â€“17 overtime win and went on to win their second straight SEC championship and a national championship.  In 1999, Florida upset the Vols in Gainesville to close out the decade.
