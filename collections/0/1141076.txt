These early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.[10] The Mexica were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250 AD, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.[11] The Mexica persuaded the king of Culhuacan, a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the Toltecs, to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called Chapultepec (ChapoltepÄ“c, "in the hill of grasshoppers"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.[12]
