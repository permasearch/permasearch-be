A portrait of Betty Crocker was first commissioned in 1936,[13] a "motherly image" that "blended the features of several Home Service Department members" that was painted by Neysa McMein.[14] It subtly changed over the years, but always accommodated General Mills' cultural perception of the American homemaker — knowledgeable and caring.[13] The 1996 portrait of Betty Crocker, according to General Mills, was partially inspired by a "computerized composite" of "75 women of diverse backgrounds and ages."[15] These portraits were always painted, with no real person ever having posed as a model.[citation needed]
