Much of the anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at Southern Italians and Sicilians, who began immigrating to the United States in large numbers after 1880. Before that, there were relatively few Italians in North America. The immigrants from the southern part of Italy and Sicily were not considered wholly white by Anglo-Saxon standards in North America. The US Immigration Department reinforced this distinction by classifying northern and southern Italians as two distinct caucasian ethnic groups.
