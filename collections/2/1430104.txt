Also, in season one, the first fifteen episodes or so, Barney's voice, done by Mel Blanc sounded similar to Elmer Fudd. Later that season, Barney's smart alecky personality was slowly toned down and Barney's voice at times was like Elmer Fudd and other times in the same episode was Mel Blanc's real voice. At the end of the first season, Mel Blanc nearly died in a car crash so for the first episodes made in the 61-62 season (season 2), Barney sounds more like Yogi Bear as he is voiced by Daws Butler. When Mel Blanc resumed the role, Barney's voice was deeper as Mel used his actual voice from there on in.
