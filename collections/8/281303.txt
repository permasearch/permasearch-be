The Dillingham Commission was set up by Congress in 1907 to investigate the effects of immigration on the country.  The Commission's 40-volume analysis of immigration during the previous three decades led it to conclude that the major source of immigration had shifted from Central, Northern, and Western Europeans to Southern Europeans and Russians.  It was, however, apt to make generalizations about regional groups that were subjective and failed to differentiate between distinct cultural attributes.[37][38]
