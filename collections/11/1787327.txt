On July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced on the Treasury Department’s website that it would delay the employer mandate for one year, under Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12 until 2015.[115][116][155][156] In the statement, the Administration said that they were delaying implementation in order to meet two goals: “First, it will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law. Second, it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees."[156]
