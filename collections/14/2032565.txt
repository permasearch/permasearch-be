The pumping lemma states that s can be split into five substrings, s = uvwxy, where vx is non-empty and the length of vwx is at most p, such that repeating v and x any (and the same) number of times in s produces a string that is still in the language (it is possible and often useful to repeat zero times, which removes v and x from the string). This process of "pumping up" additional copies of v and x is what gives the pumping lemma its name.
