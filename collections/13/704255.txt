Moon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums.[342] His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music.[343] Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.[344]
