He eventually took up the electric bass, and with some high school friends—a drummer, guitarist and saxophone player—Cetera began playing the local dance circuit, dividing lead vocals with the guitarist. Cetera played in several groups in the Chicago area, including a popular local rock band named The Exceptions, which toured the Midwest in the mid-1960s.[18][33] They released several singles and a five-song seven-inch EP titled Rock 'N' Roll Mass.[34][35][36] Cetera is quoted as saying, "By the time I was 18 I was making more money than my dad."[18]
