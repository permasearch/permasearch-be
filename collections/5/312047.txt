In 2001, Del. George W. Owings III introduced a bill in the Maryland legislature to legalize pet skunks in that state.[53]  Several officials spoke in opposition to the measure before the Environmental Matters committee.  Mike Slattery, testifying on behalf of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, criticized the idea, saying it would encourage "Bambi syndrome", the tendency to domesticate wild animals. State health officials pointed out that the bill, HB 91, required rabies vaccinations when there is no federally approved rabies vaccine for skunks.[54]
