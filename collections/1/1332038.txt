Private Joey Lombardi is the brother of Private Frankie Lombardi. Lombardi was a recruit under Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter. He was in eleven episodes of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. and was portrayed by three different actors. He had a girlfriend named Rosie, whom Gomer snuck in to base to see him, although the rules strictly prohibited visitation until after four weeks of training. Though Joey confessed that she was his girlfriend, Gomer was still punished by Gunnery Sgt. Carter for sneaking Rosie in without permission.
