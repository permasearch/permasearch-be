The Beatles recorded their third single on 5 March in Studio 2. They also wanted to record "What Goes On" and "The One After 909"(later retitled "One After 909"). In the end, only the latter was recorded, but the song remained unused until it was re-recorded during the Get Back / Let It Be sessions.[27][32] "What Goes On" was later recorded for Rubber Soul.[33] On 13 March in Studio 2, Lennon recorded a harmonica overdub for "Thank You Little Girl" (later retitled "Thank You Girl"), the single's B-side, and the song was edited and mixed. The A-side, "From Me to You", was edited and mixed on 14 March in Studio 2.[34]
