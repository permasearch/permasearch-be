The Morrisville Auxiliary Corporation is a non-profit corporation that provides dining and other services to the Morrisville campus and elsewhere including SUNY-ESF.[6] As a separate corporation, it is not bound by the same rules that the State imposes on the SUNY schools themselves, namely it is not bound by the same level of openness that public institutions are required to maintain.[7]
