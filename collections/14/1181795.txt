Fort Dakota, a military reservation established in present-day downtown, was established in May 1865.[16] Many former settlers gradually returned and a new wave of settlers arrived in the following years. The population grew to 593 by 1873, and a building boom was underway in that year. The Village of Sioux Falls, consisting of 1,200 acres (4.9Â km2), was incorporated in 1876 and was granted a city charter by the Dakota Territorial legislature on March 3, 1883.[17]
