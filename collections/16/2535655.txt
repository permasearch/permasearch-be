In an interview with People on the first anniversary of her freedom, Knight discussed some of her ordeals as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her first name to Lily (later revealed in full as Lily Rose Lee[122]) and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. Knight also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity, and that while she wants to see him, she doesn't want to bring him into the ordeal she has had to deal with, and plans to see him after he becomes an adult. Knight plans to open a restaurant, wants to marry, and adopt children. Knight also plans to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but is focusing on getting her own life on track.[123] Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015.[124]
