In the episode "Bloodletting", after Otis accidentally shoots Carl, Hershel treats the boy as best he can with the limited amount of equipment, but he will need to perform surgery, so Shane and Otis go to get more equipment. In the episode "Save the Last One", Shane arrives with the supplies, but reveals that Otis has died; miraculously, Hershel is able to save Carl's life. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", Hershel helps organize the group's search for Carol's missing daughter, Sophia. When the survivors settle down at the farm as Carl recovers, Hershel is watchful of their influence - particularly towards Shane's aggressive behavior and the group's hostile view of the walkers. He makes a deal with Rick to continue providing them safe haven, provided they stay away from the barn. In the episode "Chupacabra", Hershel is also wary of Maggie's closeness to Glenn, and becomes impatient at other difficulties the group has been causing. In the episode "Secrets", Dale confronts Hershel about the walkers he had been keeping in the barn, but Hershel defends himself by stating he feels they are just sick people. In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Rick confronts Hershel about the barn, but Hershel demands that Rick and his group must leave the farm within a week. Shane impatiently breaks open the barn door, and the group exterminates the walkers he had so desperately kept captive, including his wife and son, as well as Sophia.
