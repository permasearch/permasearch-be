History Tony, an Italian mechanic, was introduced as the boyfriend of Grace Turner, who neglected Tony's feelings and flirted with other guys. As Tony continued trying to get back together with Grace, he usually found himself in altercations with other guys. While Grace never fully wanted to rekindle her relationship with Tony, she would use him in order to get something. In 1997, they both started looking into what happened with the first child Grace's friend Sharon Newman gave up for adoption and both located the child, Cassie Newman, in Madison, Wisconsin. When Grace became attached to the child, Tony constantly tried to encourage her to do the right thing. In 1998, Tony dumped Grace for good due to her obsession with Nicholas Newman.
