The Moxx of Balhoon was originally going to be animated, but this changed to a "glove puppet" and then a full rubber suit when it was desired he be "chunkier".[1] Actor Jimmy Vee had done similar parts before,[1] although the actor said it was hard filming in the costume, which took three hours to put on.[10] Jabe was originally more tree bark-like in the face, but it was decided that she be a Silver Birch instead.[1]
