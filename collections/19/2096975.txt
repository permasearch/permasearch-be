After appearing in two consecutive World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978, the team had its biggest World Cup streak in the 1990s, with three straight tournaments. In 1990, two years after the European Championship at the UEFA Euro 1988, the Dutch went out at the Round of 16 in a defeat to West Germany. In 1994, Holland was eliminated by Brazil in the quarterfinals, and in 1998, lost to Brazil in the semifinal and Croatia at the third place match. Holland returned in 2006, being eliminated by Portugal in the Round of 16, a game known as the Battle of Nuremberg. In 2010, the team reached its third World Cup final, this time losing to Spain, with a record number of cards (24 yellow and a yellow red one). Altogether the Dutch team received 97 cards in World Cup history in 50 matches (90 yellow, 4 yellow red and 3 red in 50 games).[1] The Dutch team avenged this loss during the first match of the following 2014 World Cup, routing the Spanish 5-1, and eventually going on to reach their first 3rd place. The Dutch have also never lost a world cup match in regular time by more than one goal.
