Viticulture in Arizona began in the 16th century when missionary Spanish Jesuit priests began to plant grapevines and make wine for use in Christian religious ceremonies. Unlike most vineyards in Arizona, which are located in the southeastern portion of the state near Tucson—the location of Arizona's only designated American Viticultural Area, the Sonoita AVA—Caduceus Cellars and Merkin Vineyards are based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Keenan's place of residence, as well as the cellar where wine tasting is available, in Jerome (which is open 365 days a year).[1] Keenan has characterized the neighbors of the winery as "a teetotaling Republican community".[2]
