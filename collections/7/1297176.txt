When it opened on 28 May 1994, Big One was both the tallest and steepest roller coaster in the world.[2] It was also one of the longest out-and-back roller coasters, measuring 5,497 feet (1,675 m). With a 205-foot drop and 74 mph top speed, it was second only to Steel Phantom at Kennywood in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania in speed, but it was the fastest coaster in Europe.[2][note 1] The Big One lost its height record to Fujiyama in Japan in 1996, though it remained the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Europe until 2002, when Silver Star opened at Europa-Park in Germany. The ride still remains the tallest in the United Kingdom, although Stealth in Thorpe Park is the fastest. It is also the second longest in the UK, losing only to Lightwater Valley's Ultimate.
