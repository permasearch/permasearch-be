Common causes of LAD include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left anterior fascicular block (or hemiblock) and inferior myocardial infarction.[2][3] Less commonly LAD may be a normal variant, particularly in obese or stocky individuals, or it may be associated with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome or an ostium primum atrial septal defect.
