In July 2014, Germany took over the lead once again, having won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In July 2015, Argentina reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching both the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, as well as the 2015 Copa America Final. In November 2015, Belgium became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Belgium led the rankings until April 2016, when Argentina returned to the top. On April 6, 2017, Brazil returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time since just prior to the 2010 World Cup,[10] but Germany regained the top spot in July after winning the Confederations Cup.[11]
