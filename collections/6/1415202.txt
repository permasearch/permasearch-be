where the initial state is the acid solution with no Ca2+ (not taking into account possible CO2 dissolution) and the final state is the solution with saturated Ca2+. For strong acid concentrations, all species have a negligible concentration in the final state with respect to Ca2+ and A− so that the neutrality equation reduces approximately to 2[Ca2+] = [A−] yielding      [   C a   2 +   ] ≃    [   A   −   ]  2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle [\mathrm {Ca} ^{2+}]\simeq {\frac {[\mathrm {A} ^{-}]}{2}}}  . When the concentration decreases, [HCO3−] becomes non-negligible so that the preceding expression is no longer valid. For vanishing acid concentrations, one can recover the final pH and the solubility of CaCO3 in pure water.
