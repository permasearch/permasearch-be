The Hebrew Bible and Old Testament with which we are familiar is called the Masoretic text, a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early in the current era (the Christian era). There are, however, two other major texts, the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Septuagint ("the seventy," often called the LXX, which is 70 in Latin script) is a Greek translation of the Jewish holy books made in Egypt in the last few centuries before Christ; it mostly agrees with the Masoretic text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the Samaritan Jewish community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries before Christ—just when is disputed—and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic text as superior to the other two—the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.[37] More relevantly, all three texts have a clear purpose, which is not to record history so much as to bring the narrative to a point which represents the culmination of history.
