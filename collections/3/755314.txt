In 1965, The Kingston Trio, who six years before led the way in establishing folk as a commercial genre, recorded "Farewell" for Nick Bob John, listing it under both titles, "Farewell (Fare Thee Well)".[24][25] British skiffle musician Lonnie Donegan on The Folk Album, also released a version of the song in 1965. Four years later, Dion DiMucci, leader of rock 'n roll's Dion and the Belmonts, issued a solo folk rock album, Wonder Where I'm Bound. The album, produced by Tom Wilson, who worked with Dylan on Bringing It All Back Home, included two Dylan songs, "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" and "Farewell".[26] Other notable releases of "Farewell" in later years included Irish folk singer Liam Clancy's version on 1975's Farewell To Tarwaithie and on 1982's The Dutchman and bluegrass musician Tony Rice's on 1984's Cold on the Shoulder.[27][28]
