Permit holders may appeal a permit suspension, denial or revocation. Utah law states that "In the event of a denial, suspension, or revocation of a permit, the applicant or permit holder may file a petition for review with the board within 60 days from the date the denial, suspension, or revocation is received by the applicant or permit holder".[13]
