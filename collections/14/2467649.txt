Pete is part of the main group of Disney villains led by Maleficent. He is originally a steamboat captain from Disney Castle prior to the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, where he causes mischief in Disney Town until he is banished to another dimension for his evil ways by Queen Minnie. However, he is freed by Maleficent and vows to help her conquer the worlds.[57] As such, he plays an unseen role until Kingdom Hearts II in order to build a Heartless army for Maleficent, and spends much of his appearances in the series following Sora throughout the worlds he and his group visit, mainly to recruit local villains, old and new, to either join Maleficent's fold or turn them into Heartless for his own purposes. Despite his bumbling ways, Pete remains Maleficent's only loyal ally throughout the series.
