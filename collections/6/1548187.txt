After more success with another No.1 hit named "No One Needs To Know", which was selected for the soundtrack to the film "Twister", and another minor hit "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)", Twain decided to turn "God Bless The Child" into a full-length song. She and Lange co-wrote new verses touching on the turbulent lives in people's society, and Lange developed two new instrumentals for Twain to record her vocals on: a country version with a banjo and a pop version with a subtle electronic beat. Both versions contain the same acoustic drum set, guitars and chord arrangements, and also feature the Fisk University Jubilee singers and a local performing arts choir on backing vocals.
