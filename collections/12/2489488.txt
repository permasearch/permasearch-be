All warm-blooded species, including humans, may become infected with the rabies virus and develop symptoms. Birds were first artificially infected with rabies in 1884; however, infected birds are largely, if not wholly, asymptomatic, and recover.[26] Other bird species have been known to develop rabies antibodies, a sign of infection, after feeding on rabies-infected mammals.[27][28]
