The 1998 All-Star Game featured the first change in format in years in an attempt to promote the first Olympic hockey tournament with participation from NHL players.[citation needed] From 1998 to 2002, a team of North American All-Stars faced a team of non-North Americans, known as the World All-Stars. Some critics suggested replacing the game with a miniature national tournament,[citation needed] in the style of the World Cup of Hockey. Some fans were unhappy with a team consisting of 75% Canadian players being labeled "North America."[citation needed] The "First International Showdown", as it was billed, resulted in the North American All-Stars winning 8â€“7.
