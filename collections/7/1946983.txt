According to Liam, those who have a million subscribers like JiffPom can get more studio time at Vuuugle. In order to raise their subscribers for Bizaardvark, Paige and Frankie plan to collaborate with the other Vuuuglers. They end up working with Victor of "Prank Town" because nobody else wanted to collaborate with the "newbies." What Paige and Frankie don't know is that Victor was secretly known for ruining the other Internet stars that used to work for Vuuugle. Meanwhile, Dirk and Amelia do their video collaboration.
