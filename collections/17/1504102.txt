Its early July 1973 revival production at the Academy Playhouse in Lake Forest went on to four previews with the first Broadway staging also directed by José Quintero opening on December 29, 1973, at the Morosco Theatre, where it ran for 313 performances. Both production casts included Colleen Dewhurst who won a Tony Award, Jason Robards, and Ed Flanders a Tony Award recipient as well. The cast again resurrected their roles in a Quintero-directed production for television, broadcast by ABC on May 27, 1975. One of their affiliates in the state of Florida pre-empted the film controversially because it contained adult language.[6] It garnered five Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Special—Drama or Comedy, with Flanders also winning the award for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special.
