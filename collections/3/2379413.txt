The self-categorization theory developed by John Turner states that the self-concept consists of at least two "levels": a personal identity and a social one. In other words, one's self-evaluation relies on self-perceptions and how others perceive them. Self-concept can alternate rapidly between the personal and social identity.[20] Children and adolescents begin integrating social identity into their own self-concept in elementary school by assessing their position among peers.[21] By age 5, acceptance from peers has a significant impact on children's self-concept, affecting their behavior and academic success.[22]
