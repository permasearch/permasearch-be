West's vocals are substantially manipulated throughout the song from "naturally clear-sounding and ominously pitched-down as it pans back and forth",[21] as they are slowed down, sped up, edited substantially, and altered in various ways, giving the song a brooding, ominous mood.[21][23] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal wrote that this effect "bottoms out with a verse in which Kanye's voice is sped up, slowed down and stretched out ... The effect is almost psychotic, suggesting three or four inner monologues fighting over smashed emotions."[24] AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer commented that the vocal altercations gives the sense of the "multiple personalities and paranoia he tries to overcome."[23]
