In a mixed review, Hazel Sheffield of NME asserted that the album "might lack the raw appeal of" Section.80, "but it's a big-budget reminder that [Lamar] hasn't forgotten his roots."[66] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian criticized "Lamar's depiction of downtrodden women" as "unnecessarily prurient and unconvincing", but praised his "ability to pull the listener inside the action while retaining an alienated detachment".[29] Although he observed "some degree of self-indulgence", Andrew Nosnitsky of Spin found the album's production "surprisingly cohesive" and commented that Lamar "manages to hold everything together in the midst of such chaos through sheer craftsmanship."[23] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone felt that the album "warrants a place in that storied lineage" of "Seventies blaxploitation soundtracks and Nineties gangsta rap blaxploitation revivals".[33] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended Lamar for giving "gangsta tropes ... a twist, or sometimes upend[ing] them completely", and wrote that the album "brims with comedy, complexity and the many voices in Kendrick Lamar's head."[16] Robert Christgau from MSN Music felt that its "commitment to drama has musical drawbacks", but stated, "the atmospheric beats Dr. Dre and his hirelings lay under the raps and choruses establish a musical continuity that shores up a nervous flow that's just what Lamar's rhymes need."[15]
