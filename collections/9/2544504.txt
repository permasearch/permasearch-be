Separately, in 1967, voters approved a $2.5 billion (worth about $17,957,000,000 in current dollars) Transportation Bond Issue, which provided over $600 million (worth $4,310,000,000 today) for New York City projects, including for a 1968 Program for Action.[25][23][45] The City secured a $25 million Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) grant for initial construction.[28]:219[30] The Program for Action proposed a Second Avenue line to be built in two phases: a first phase north of 34th Street and a second phase south of there.[46] The Second Avenue project, for a line from 34th Street to the Bronx, was given top priority.[30][25] However, the line's planned stops in Manhattan, spaced farther apart than those on existing subway lines, proved controversial;[47]:37 the Second Avenue line was criticized as a "rich man's express, circumventing the Lower East Side with its complexes of high-rise low- and middle-income housing and slums in favor of a silk stocking route.”[28]:218 In response to protests, the MTA added stations at 72nd Street[48] and 96th Street[49][50] The MTA issued a plan for a spur line, called the "cuphandle", to serve the heart of the Lower East Side. Branching off from the IND Sixth Avenue Line near the Second Avenue station, the spur would run east on Houston Street, turn north on Avenue C, and turn west on 14th Street, connecting to the BMT Canarsie Line.[51]
