A principle of relationship marketing is the retention of customers through varying means to ensure repeated trade from preexisting customers by satisfying requirements above those of competing companies through a mutually beneficial relationship[7][8] This technique is counterbalancing new customers and opportunities with current and existing customers as a means of maximizing profit and counteracting the "leaky bucket theory of business" in which new customers gained in older direct marketing oriented businesses were at the expense of or coincided with the loss of older customers.[9][10] This process of "churning" is less economically viable than retaining all or the majority of customers using both direct and relationship management as lead generation via new customers requires more investment.[11]
