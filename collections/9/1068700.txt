It is estimated that at least 100 people lost their lives, mostly due to mudslides, including five persons in Havana.[16][17] However, reports range as high as 700.[18] Initial estimates of the financial damage caused by the storm were in the millions of dollars, including losses of $1 million in Havana, largely from the destruction of Customs House sheds there, which were filled with many valuable goods.[11] Some of these buildings were swept 0.5 mi (0.80 km) away, and the winds tore the roof off the main warehouse.[10] In the aftermath—while the hurricane was still widely considered to be two separate storms—rumors arose "of the approach of a third storm",[11] although in actuality no additional storms were known to have occurred in the 1910 season.[1]
