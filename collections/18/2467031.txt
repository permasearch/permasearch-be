Phyllis and Michael began a wild affair. With the help of Brian, all of Phyllis's lies and manipulations were brought out in court, including the fact that Danny had been drugged that first time and never even made love with Phyllis as she had claimed. The court found her to be unstable and an unfit mother. Danny won custody of Daniel, whom he still considered his son, although Phyllis was allowed visitation. Brian left town soon after the custody agreement was finalized.
