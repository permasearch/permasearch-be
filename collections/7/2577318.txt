Morgan breaks off to save Father Gabriel, and Carol continues alone, killing many Wolves along the way. Carol secures the armory and distributes guns to the surviving Alexandrians. She executes a Wolf that Morgan had taken prisoner, and Morgan openly disagrees with Carol's belief that the Wolves must be killed. Morgan separates from the group again and runs into another group of Wolves, led by one he had previously encountered. Morgan convinces the Wolves to retreat by pointing out that the Alexandrians have guns and they do not.
