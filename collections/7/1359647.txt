All heroes are unique and have their own weapons, skills, and fighting styles.[4] There are 12 pieces of downloadable content. Players fight against their opponents with their class-specific melee weapons. When players perform certain actions, such as killing multiple enemies consecutively, they gain Feats, which are additional perks. These perks allow players to gain additional points and strengths, call in a barrage of arrows or a catapult attack, or heal themselves.[5] In most missions, players are accompanied by numerous AI minions. They are significantly weaker than the player character, and do not pose much threat.
