American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey has recorded songs for five studio albums, three extended plays (EPs), as well as guest features. Her debut EP Kill Kill (2008) was released by 5 Points Records under her birth name Elizabeth "Lizzy" Grant; its tracks "Kill Kill" and "Yayo" were written solely by Grant, while the remaining song "Gramma (Blue Ribbon Sparkler Trailer Heaven)" was co-written by Grant and David Kahne.[1] She assumed the stage name Lana Del Ray for her debut studio album Lana Del Ray (2010) and wrote the majority of the record by herself, although Kahne is credited with co-writing four tracks on the project.[2]
