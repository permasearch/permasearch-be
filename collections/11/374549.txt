In addition to expanding its customer base, Verizon expanded its services in the first few years. Home Media DVR, a digital video recorder, was released in 2006.[11] Fios updated its user interface in 2007, allowing customers to access widgets for localized content, such as weather and traffic.[12][13] Verizon announced in January 2008 that one million people subscribed to the service. By the end of 2008, Fios offered more than 150 HD channels.[12] Price increases were announced in April 2008, when Fios was available to (not necessarily subscribed by) 6.5Â million households.[14]
