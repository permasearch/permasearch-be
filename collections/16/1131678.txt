McCandless' life became the subject of a number of articles, books, films, and documentaries, which helped elevate his life to the status of modern myth.[27] He became a romantic figure to some inspired by what they see as his free-spirited idealism, but to others a controversial misguided figure.[20][28][29] "The Magic Bus" has become a pilgrimage destination for trekkers who camp at the vehicle, some of whom have also gotten into difficulties due to the Teklanika River.[27][28]
