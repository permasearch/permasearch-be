On 20 June 1968, civil rights activists (including Austin Currie, a nationalist MP) protested against housing discrimination by squatting in a house in Caledon. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children.[73] RUC officers – one of whom was Beattie's brother – forcibly removed the activists.[73] Two days before the protest, the two Catholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed by police.[74] Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to Stormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil rights movement.[75]
