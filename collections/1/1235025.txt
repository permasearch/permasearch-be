John Lowe (Wes Bentley) answers a phone call from Scarlett (Shree Crooks). During the call, he notices his ceiling and wall are bleeding. Miss Evers (Mare Winningham) is having trouble getting out a difficult bloodstain as well. Every Halloween, she is reminded of her son, who was kidnapped in 1925. John arrives to question the blood coming from her room, and they talk as she explains that her son was taken to a ranch outside town, and all they found was the costume. His kidnapper had taken and killed many children and disposed of their bodies with quick lime and set them in a mass grave. After the recounting, her mood upswings as she blathers on about preparations for the festivities. Alex Lowe (ChloÃ« Sevigny) has brought Holden (Lennon Henry) home, but the family dog rejects him. As she returns with a glass of juice for Holden, she finds him feeding on the dog's neck. He does not feel well, and wants his "other mommy".
