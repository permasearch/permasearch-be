Dog meat is the flesh and other edible parts derived from dogs. Historically, human consumption of dog meat has been recorded in many parts of the world, including East and Southeast Asia, West Africa, Europe, Oceania and the Americas.[2] In the 21st century, dog meat is consumed in many parts of China,[3] Korea,[4] and Vietnam.[5] Some cultures view the consumption of dog meat as part of their traditional and day-to-day cuisine, while other cultures consider consumption of dog meat a taboo, although they have been consumed in times of war or other hardships.[6][7] It was estimated in 2014 that worldwide, 25 million dogs are eaten each year by humans.[8]
