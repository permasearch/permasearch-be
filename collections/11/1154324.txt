He's first introduced in the beginning of the second season as an outcast. He later changes after an incident with the ex-principal. After, he starts socialising more and becomes good friends with Leornando, but there friendship is cut short when Leonardo moves away to play soccer. He becomes a very hot gothic rocker who has a crush on Lupita. He knows that she likes him back. Lupita's sister Lola has a crush on him, so there's somewhat of a love triangle there. Santos is easy-going and relaxed for the most part. He always keeps his cool and never exasperates himself. He serves as a loyal advisory to his best friend, Miguel. He sometimes acts as a middleman between Lupita and Lola's constant arguments. He is willing to put everything on the line for his loved ones.
