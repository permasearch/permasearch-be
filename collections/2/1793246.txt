It is thus possible to create a biclique of size      2  2 d     {\displaystyle 2^{2d}}   (     2  2 d     {\displaystyle 2^{2d}}   since all      2  d     {\displaystyle 2^{d}}   keys of the first set of keys, can be combined with the      2  d     {\displaystyle 2^{d}}   keys from the second set of keys). This means a biclique of size      2  2 d     {\displaystyle 2^{2d}}   can be created using only     2 ∗  2  d     {\displaystyle 2*2^{d}}   computations of the differentials      Δ  i     {\displaystyle \Delta _{i}}   and      ∇  j     {\displaystyle \nabla _{j}}   over     f   {\displaystyle f}  . If      Δ  i   ≠  ∇  j     {\displaystyle \Delta _{i}\neq \nabla _{j}}   for     i + j > 0   {\displaystyle i+j>0}   then all of the keys     K [ i , j ]   {\displaystyle K[i,j]}   will also be different in the biclique.
