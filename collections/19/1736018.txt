In 1965, an act of the Georgia General Assembly created the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, or MARTA. MARTA was to provide rapid transit for the five largest metro counties: DeKalb, Fulton, Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb, but a referendum authorizing participation in the system failed in Cobb County. A 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, but in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and "undesirable elements".[59] In 1972, the agency bought the existing, bus-only Atlanta Transit Company.[60] Construction began on the new rail system in 1975, and service commenced on June 30, 1979, running east-west from Georgia State University downtown to Avondale. The Five Points downtown hub opened later that year. A short north-south line opened in 1981, which by 1984 had been extended to reach from Brookhaven to Lakewood/Fort McPherson. In 1988 the line was extended to a station inside the airport terminal.[60] A line originally envisioned to run to Emory University is still under consideration.[61]
