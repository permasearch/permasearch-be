According to Leffler's exegesis, Bush has invoked a balance of power vocabulary in purpose to integrate the tradition with the hegemonic dilemma.[109] British Orwell Prize-winning policy analyst, Anatol Lieven, comments: In this conception, however, a phrase “was a form of Orwellian doublespeak. The clear intention actually was to be so strong that other countries had no choice but to rally to the side of the United States, concentrating all real power and freedom of action in the hands of America.”[110] The surprising rehabilitation of the balance-of-power term in the 2002 NSS “can be accounted for in terms of mythopoetic function that the terminology serves in the document.” It keeps alive the traditional concept in a new unipolar world.[111]
