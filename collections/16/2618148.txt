Ericsson et al. conducted a study with an undergraduate student "S.F." who had an initial digit span of 7 (within the normal range).[35] This means that, on average, he was able to recall sequences of 7 random numbers after they were presented. Following more than 230 hours of practice, S.F. was able to increase his digit span to 79. S.F.'s use of mnemonics was essential. He used race times, ages, and dates to categorize the numbers, creating mnemonic associations.[35]
