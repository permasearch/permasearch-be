Exits on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway were originally numbered consecutively, beginning with exit 1. As a result, Interstate 95 in Maryland had multiple conflicting sequences of exit numbers. In the mid-1980s, the exits were re-numbered according to a statewide, mileage-based numbering system, so that they now range from Exit 2 (I-295 north) on the Capital Beltway to Exit 109 (MD 279) on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.
