The Sole Survivor seeks out Nick Valentine, a detective based in Diamond City, to locate their son. With his help, they uncover the identity of their spouse's killer: Conrad Kellogg. After learning from Kellogg that Shaun is being held in the Institute, the Sole Survivor kills him and retrieves a cybernetic implant from his brain for further access into his memories. During this time, the Brotherhood of Steel, an anti-synth faction, arrives in the Commonwealth on the Prydwen, an airship, hoping to preserve technology in the Commonwealth. The Sole Survivor learns from Brian Virgil, an ex-Institute scientist, that the only way into the Institute is by using a teleportation chip. After retrieving the chip, the Survivor decodes it with the help of the Railroad, a secretive organization dedicated to rescuing synths. Virgil provides the blueprints for the teleportation device, which the Sole Survivor constructs by allying with the Brotherhood, Minutemen, or Railroad.
