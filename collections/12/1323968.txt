Many initiatives carried out with social entrepreneurs while innovative, have had problems becoming sustainable and effective initiatives that ultimately were able to branch out and reach the larger society as a whole (versus a small community or group of people).[7] Studies of the qualities of social entrepreneurs have shown that very few individuals possess the talent and skills of entrepreneurs while at the same time having a primarily socially motivated outlook.[45] Thus, compromises in social initiatives were developed, which often did not reach large audiences or help larger communities. Since the concept of social entrepreneurship has been popularized in the 2000s, some advocates suggest that there needs to be some standardization of the process in scaling up social endeavors to increase the impact of these ventures across the globe.[7]
