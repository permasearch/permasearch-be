Cerberus (Kerberos), or the "Hell-Hound", is Hades' massive multi-headed (usually three-headed)[39][40][41] dog with some descriptions stating that it also has a snake-headed tail and snake heads on its back and as its mane. Born from Echidna and Typhon, Cerberus guards the gate that serves as the entrance of the Underworld.[21] Cerberus' duty is to prevent dead people from leaving the Underworld.
