Black-body radiation becomes a visible glow of light if the temperature of the object is high enough. The Draper point is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red, about 7002798000000000000♠798 K.[20] At 7003100000000000000♠1000 K, a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity (let us call it an oven), viewed from outside, looks red; at 7003600000000000000♠6000 K, it looks white. No matter how the oven is constructed, or of what material, as long as it is built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls, it will contain a good approximation to black-body radiation. The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the black-body curve. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.
