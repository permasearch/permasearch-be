In 2007, members of the Annapolis Group discussed a letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the US News "reputation survey".[53] A majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting agreed not to participate,[54] although the statements were not binding.[55] Members pledged to develop alternative web-based information formats[55] in conjunction with several collegiate associations.[56] US News responded that their peer assessment survey helps them measure a college's "intangibles" such as the ability of a college's reputation to help a graduate win a first job or entrance into graduate school.[57] An article by Nicholas Thompson in Washington Monthly criticized the U.S. News rankings as "confirming the prejudices of the meritocracy" by tuning their statistical algorithms to entrench the reputations of a handful of schools, while failing to measure how much students learn.[58] Thompson described the algorithms as being "opaque enough that no one outside the magazine can figure out exactly how they work, yet clear enough to imply legitimacy."[58]
