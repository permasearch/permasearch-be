On January 16, 2012, shooting began in New Orleans, Louisiana, which lasted until March 26, 2012.[7] Additional filming took place in New York City on February 13[8] and in Las Vegas from April 9, 2012 to the following day.[9] During filming of the scene where Henley Reeves tries to escape from a tank of water and piranhas, Isla Fisher came close to drowning. Fisher had become stuck and tried to alert the crew by banging on the window she was facing, but the cast and crew did not think anything of it because that was what the character was supposed to be doing. She was able to untangle the chain and get out of the tank safely.[10]
