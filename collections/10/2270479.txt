Gavin is a male given name. It is the late medieval form of the name Gawain, which in turn is believed to have originated from the Welsh name Gwalchgwyn, meaning "White Hawk". Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is an epic poem connected with King Arthur's Round Table. Gavin also shares an origin with the Italian name Gavino, which dates back to ancient Latin. Saint Gavinus (San Gavino, Porto Torres, Sardinia) was an early Christian martyr, an exâ€“Roman centurion, decapitated in 300 AD and whose head was thrown in the Mediterranean sea before being reunited with his body.
