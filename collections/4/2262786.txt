Kevin Daley- A 17-year-old boy who helps his friend Alex to get food and teaches him how to "body shop" (taking the valuable items off of the people who drop dead in the streets), and how to use those items to barter with the last guy in the city to give out food. Kevin dies in front of Alex's eyes when a tree branch falls and suffocates him.
