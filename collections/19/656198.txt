James's first idea for The Portrait of a Lady was simple: a young American woman confronting her destiny, whatever it might be. Only then did he begin to form a plot to bring out the character of his central figure. This was the uncompromising story of the free-spirited Isabel losing her freedom—despite (or because of) suddenly coming into a great deal of money—and getting "ground in the very mill of the conventional".[3] It is a rather existentialist novel,[citation needed] as Isabel is very committed to living with the consequences of her choice with both integrity and a sort of stubbornness.
