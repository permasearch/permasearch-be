A vortex is a region where the fluid flows around an imaginary axis. For an irrotational vortex, the flow at every point is such that a small particle placed there undergoes pure translation and does not rotate. Velocity varies inversely with radius in this case. Velocity will tend to     inf   {\displaystyle \inf }   at     r = 0   {\displaystyle r=0}   that is the reason for center being a singular point. The velocity is mathematically expressed as â€“
