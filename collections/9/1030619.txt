A transform is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and repeated movement of the crossfader. The name, which has been associated with DJ Jazzy Jeff,[17] comes from its similarity to the sound made by the robots in the 1980s cartoon, The Transformers.
