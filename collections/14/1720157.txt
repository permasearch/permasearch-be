Churchill was an amateur bricklayer, constructing buildings and garden walls at his country home at Chartwell,[353] where he also bred butterflies.[520] As part of this hobby Churchill joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers,[521] but was expelled due to his revived membership in the Conservative Party.[353]
