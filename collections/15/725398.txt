The Enterprise is summoned to Deep Space Station K7 by a "priority one" distress call, used only in case of disaster. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is infuriated to learn that there has been no disaster: the distress call was ordered by Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Federation Undersecretary of Agricultural Affairs, who only wants guards for his shipments of quadrotriticale grain bound for Sherman's Planet. The grain is crucial for the Federation's plan to develop the planet and claim it under the terms of the Organian Peace Treaty. Starfleet Command shares Baris's concerns and orders Kirk to cooperate.
