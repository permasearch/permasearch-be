In Espírito Santo, there is significant Italian and German influence in local dishes, both savory and sweet.[citation needed] The state dish, though, is of Amerindian origin,[citation needed] called moqueca capixaba  which is a tomato and fish stew prepared in a Panela de Barro(clay pot). Amerindian and Italian cuisine are the two main pillars of Capixaba cuisine. Seafood dishes in general are very popular in Espírito Santo but unlike other Amerindian dishes the use of olive oil is almost mandatory. Bobó de camarão, Torta Capixaba, Polenta are also very popular.
