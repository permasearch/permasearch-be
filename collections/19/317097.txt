The first image of a live mature giant squid was taken on 15 January 2002, on Goshiki beach, Amino Cho, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.[44][45][46][47][48] The animal, which measured about 2 m (6.6 ft) in mantle length and 4 m (13 ft) in total length,[45] was found near the water's surface. It was captured and tied to a quay, where it died overnight.[45] The specimen was identified by Koutarou Tsuchiya of the Tokyo University of Fisheries. It is on display at the National Science Museum of Japan.
