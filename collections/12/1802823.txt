Washington Initiative 502 (I-502) "on marijuana reform" was an initiative to the Washington State Legislature, which appeared on the November 2012 general ballot, passing by a margin of approximately 56 to 44 percent. Originally submitted to the Washington Secretary of State during the summer of 2011,[1] enough signatures were collected and submitted by December to meet the required 241,153 signatures, sending it to the legislature.[2] When the legislature adjourned without action in April, Initiative 502 automatically advanced to the November 2012 general ballot.[3] It was approved by popular vote on November 6, and took effect over the course of a year, beginning with certification no later than December 6, 2012.[4] Along with a similar Colorado measure, Initiative 502 was credited for encouraging voter turnout of 81%, the highest in the nation.[5]
