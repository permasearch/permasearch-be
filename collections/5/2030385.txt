The package was dubbed 4-4-2 based on its combination of four-barrel carburetor, four-speed manual transmission, and dual exhausts.[1][5][6] Priced at $285.14, it was available on any F-85 or Cutlass model except the station wagon, although most were Cutlass hardtop coup√©s (Oldsmobile archives indicate that approximately 10 four-door sedans were built with the B09 option).
