In 2006, mtDNA research revealed that a lion kept in the German Zoo Neuwied originated from the collection of the King of Morocco and is very likely a descendant of a Barbary lion.[7] Five tested samples of lions from the famous collection of the King of Morocco are not maternally Barbary lions. Nonetheless, genes of the Barbary lion are likely to be present in common European zoo lions, since this was one of the most frequently introduced subspecies. Therefore, many lions in European and American zoos, which are managed without subspecies classification, are in fact partly descendants of Barbary lions.[21]
