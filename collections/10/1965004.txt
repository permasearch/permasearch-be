When she was nine years old, Richards had the His Dark Materials books read to her by her mother, feeling that she could "be her".[1] After she saw the stage adaptation at the National Theatre, she says she "just wanted to be Lyra".[7][8] Philip Pullman, author of the books, said, "As soon as I saw Dakota's screen test, I realised that the search was over."[9] Chris Weitz, the director, added that Richards "made what should have been an extremely difficult decision quite easy."[9] The Golden Compass with Richards as Lyra was released worldwide in December 2007 and grossed $372 million.
