Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
