There is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended.[79] If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures.[45] Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol.[80] Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required.[51][81] Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation.[46][82] Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary.[59] With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.[56][59]
