She originally was a warrior, but when Mudfur found a moth's wing outside the medicine cat den, he interpreted it as a sign that Mothwing should be his apprentice. It is later revealed that Hawkfrost had actually put it there without Mothwing's initial knowledge in order to help himself in his plan to gain power within his Clan. After he revealed the truth to Mothwing, her faith in StarClan was destroyed.[45] However,  Leafpool, Mistystar, Willowshine, and Jayfeather are the only cats to know this. When she first joined the Clan, she, along with Hawkfrost, had trouble being accepted into RiverClan because their mother was a rogue and their father was Tigerstar. Though she does not have faith in StarClan, a vital requirement for a medicine cat, StarClan have let her remain a medicine cat because they have seen how hard she has studied and trained for this role and for clear her devotion to her Clan. She has mentored one medicine cat apprentice, Willowshine.
