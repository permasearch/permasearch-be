On 23 December 2014, Bonham Carter and Burton announced that they had "separated amicably" earlier that year.[59][60] Of the separation, Bonham Carter was refreshingly open with the public about the difficulty. She told Harper's Bazaar: “Everyone always says you have to be strong and have a stiff upper lip, but it’s okay to be fragile.... You’ve got to take very small steps, and sometimes you won’t know where to go next because you’ve lost yourself.”[54] She added: “With divorce, you go through massive grief — it is a death of a relationship, so it’s utterly bewildering. Your identity, everything, changes.”
