The AKC accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States.[6][5] They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers.[7] International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers.[5] It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier.[8] The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.[9] He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen.[9] Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.[9]
