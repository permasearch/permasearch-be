In 1970, the Chargers were placed into the AFC West division after the NFL merger with the AFL.[22][23] But by then, the Chargers fell on hard times; Gillman, who had returned as general manager, stepped down in 1971, and many of the Chargers players from the 1960s had already either retired or had been traded.[24] The Chargers acquired veteran players like Deacon Jones[25] and Johnny Unitas;[26] however, it was at the later stages of their careers and the team struggled, placing third or fourth in the AFC West each year from 1970 to 1978. During the 1973 season, the Chargers were involved in the first major drug scandal in the NFL.[27]
