In professional baseball, a batted ball that goes over the outfield wall after touching the ground (i.e. a ball that bounces over the outfield wall) becomes an automatic double. This is colloquially referred to as a "ground rule double" because the rule is not strictly written into the rules of baseball, but is rather a rule of the field (or "grounds") being used.
