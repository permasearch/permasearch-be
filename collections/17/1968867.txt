In his victory speech, Khan said that his victory represented a victory for "hope over fear"[216] Internationally and in the UK, many responses focused on Khan's election as the first Muslim mayor of London.[3] Khan received congratulations from politicians globally, including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls; Hillary Clinton, who at the time was the Democratic front-runner for the United States 2016 presidential primaries; and Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who in 2014 became the first Christian governor of an Indonesian province.[3][217] Khan's working-class background was also noted, particularly in contrast to the aristocratic background of Goldsmith.[3] A week after the election, Khan announced Joanne McCartney, London Assembly member for Enfield and Haringey, as his deputy mayor.[218]
