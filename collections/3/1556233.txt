A Pilot Car is sometimes called an escort vehicle, or flag car. It is a marked vehicle with warning signs and lights that operates in front of or behind a large vehicle that exceeds normal vehicle dimensions in height, length, width and/or overhang. The escort vehicle protects the oversize load and warns and protects other roadway users. Pilot cars must conform to state-dictated standards.[6]
