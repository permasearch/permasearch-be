A referendum on introducing a unicameral Parliament instead of the current bicameral Parliament was held in Romania on 22 November 2009. The turnout rate was 50.95%, with 77.78% of "Yes" votes for a unicameral Parliament.[20] This referendum had a consultative role, thus requiring a parliamentary initiative and another referendum to ratify the new proposed changes.
