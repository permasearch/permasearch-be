The soundtrack consists of 24 tracks including seven songs and other scores.[50][51] One song "Kaam 25" sung and written by rapper Divine and music by the rock band  Phenom, was released on 14 June, 2018.[52] It was not used in the series. According to Sidhantha Jain of Firstpost, the song is a "hard-hitting, hypnotic Mumbai anthem inspired by the streets."[52] One of Divine's earlier song "Jungli Sher", was also used in the series' trailer.[52] The background score and the opening theme was composed by Alokananda Dasgupta.[31] She also composed four songs in it: "Saiyaan", "Tabahi", "Dhuaan Dhuaan" and "Kukooâ€™s Couplet".[31] Both Dasgupta and Motwane came up with the idea that the theme "should have a religious connotation but it shouldn't remind one of any particular religion". She then created gibberish lines after deciding to include an ominous chant by humming with a vocalist to record with a cello.[31] Rachita Arora composed two tracks of the album, "Disco Capital" and "Labon Se Chhukar." She was briefed by Kashyap to listen to the songs of Bappi Lahiri to get a "sense of the infectious rhythm that defined his music."[53]
