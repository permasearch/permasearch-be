The term personality has been applied to human research, whereas the term temperament has been mostly used for animal research.[17] However, both terms have been used interchangeably in the literature, or purely to distinguish humans from animals and avoid anthropomorphism.[18] Personality can be defined by “a set of behaviours that are consistent over context and time”.[19] Human personality is often studied using models that look at broad dimensions of personality. For example, the Five Factor Model is one of the most commonly used models, and the most extensively studied. It is composed of five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.[20] Studies of dog personality have also tried to identify the presence of broad personality traits that are stable over time.[18][19] Recently, dog’s personality dimension has been shown to be relatively consistent over time.[21][22]
