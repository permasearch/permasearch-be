Simple cuboidal epithelium commonly differentiates to form the secretory and duct portions of glands.[1] They also constitute the germinal epithelium which covers the ovary (but does not contribute to ovum production) and the internal walls of the seminiferous tubules in the male testes. These cells offer some protection and function in absorption and secretion.
