Because of the opening of Phase 1, ridership on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016.[143][144] The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenueâ€“63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 by the end of January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000.[143] By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening.[145][146] By May 15, Second Avenue ridership had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue ridership in January. Because of the increasing demand, Q service will be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one uptown trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service.[147] This trip will return southbound in the evening in Q service.[148][65]
