In the summer of 1013, Sven Forkbeard, King of Denmark, brought the Danish fleet to Sandwich, Kent.[124] From there he went north to the Danelaw, where the locals immediately agreed to support him.[124] He then struck south, forcing Æthelred into exile in Normandy (1013–1014). However, on 3 February 1014 Sven died suddenly.[124] Capitalising on his death, Æthelred returned to England and drove Sven's son, Cnut, back to Denmark, forcing him to abandon his allies in the process.[124] In 1015, Cnut launched a new campaign against England.[124] Edmund fell out with his father, Æthelred, and struck out on his own.[125] Some English leaders decided to support Cnut, so Æthelred ultimately retreated to London.[125] Before engagement with the Danish army, Æthelred died and was replaced by Edmund.[125] The Danish army encircled and besieged London, but Edmund was able to escape and raised an army of loyalists.[125] Edmund's army routed the Danes, but the success was short-lived: at the battle of Ashingdon the Danes were victorious and many of the English leaders were killed.[125] Cnut and Edmund agreed to split the kingdom in two, with Edmund ruling Wessex and Cnut the rest.[125][126]
