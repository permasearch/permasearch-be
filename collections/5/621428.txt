In the first season, the adult cast was paid a range of approximately $30,000 to $90,000 per episode.[46] As a result of the show's success, the cast attempted to renegotiate their contracts in the summer of 2012 to obtain higher per-episode fees, but talks broke down to the point that the fourth season's first table read had to be postponed. Five of the cast members (Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet, and Sofía Vergara) retained the Quinn Emanuel law firm and sued 20th Century Fox Television in Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 24, 2012.  While not part of the lawsuit, Ed O'Neill joined his fellow castmates in seeking raises for each to about $200,000 per episode; O'Neill had been earning more money per episode than the other five. The lawsuit invoked the "seven-year rule" in California Labor Code Section 2855 (the De Havilland Law) and requested a declaration that their contracts were void because they were in violation of that rule.[47] As of July 28, 2012, the conflict had been resolved. The five adult cast members' salaries were increased from $55,000–$65,000 per episode to $150,000–$175,000, with increases every season, plus a percentage of back end profits.[clarification needed][48] O'Neill had already been earning $200,000 an episode, so his salary was lowered to parity with his co-stars but with a larger percentage of the back-end profits.[clarification needed][49] Later in the summer four of the five child stars negotiated increases from $15,000–$25,000 to $70,000 per episode[50] with an additional $10,000 per season raise.[51]
