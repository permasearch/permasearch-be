Incorporated engineer is a first-cycle qualification for Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Science degree holders (Sydney Accord, equivalent to technologist). Chartered engineer is a second-cycle qualification usually reserved for holders of integrated Master of Engineering degrees. Both IEng and CEng require substantial professional experience (4â€“8 years post graduate), a professional review and an interview.
