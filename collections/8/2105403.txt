For U.S. cable television, the FCC voted 5â€“0 on September 12, 2007 to require operators to make local broadcasts available to their users in analog. This requirement lasts until 2012, when the FCC will review the case again.[needs update] This was necessary since many cable companies, including major ones like Comcast, have been taking analog channels away from customers.[16]
