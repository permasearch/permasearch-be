Ayla city (modern day Aqaba) in southern Jordan also came under Byzantine Empire rule.[41] The Aqaba Church was built around 300 AD, and is considered to be the world's first purpose built Christian church.[43] The Byzantines built 16 churches just south of Amman in Umm ar-Rasas.[44] Administratively the area of Jordan fell under the Diocese of the East, and was divided between the provinces of Palaestina Secunda in the north-west and Arabia Petraea in the south and east.[45] Palaestina Salutaris in the south was split off from Arabia Petraea in the late 4th century.[45] The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.[46]
