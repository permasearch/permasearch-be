By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga on the run from creditors.[34] Debts would plague Wagner for most of his life.[35] Initially they took a stormy sea passage to London,[36] from which Wagner drew the inspiration for his opera Der fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman), with a plot based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine.[37] The Wagners settled in Paris in September 1839[28] and stayed there until 1842. Wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as A pilgrimage to Beethoven, which sketched his growing concept of "music drama", and An end in Paris, where he depicts his own miseries as a German musician in the French metropolis.[38] He also provided arrangements of operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the Schlesinger publishing house. During this stay he completed his third and fourth operas Rienzi and Der fliegende Holländer.[38]
