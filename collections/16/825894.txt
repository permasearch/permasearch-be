When asked about her character potentially appearing in an MCU film, Palicki said "that was one of the things that was discussed when I was coming on for the part, and you know, we’ll see what happens. It’s such a nice world that we live in that crossover can happen so often now which in the past it never really did so, to see these worlds come together on the small screen and the big screen is really cool."[88] Palicki left the series following the season three episode "Parting Shot" to star in the spin-off show Marvel's Most Wanted.[77]
