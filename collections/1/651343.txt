The term crunk is used as a blanket term to denote any style of southern hip hop,[25] but it is mainly used to denote a musical style that was originated by Three Six Mafia in Memphis, Tennessee, in the mid-to-late 1990s. It was popularized by Atlanta rapper Lil Jon,[26] and gained mainstream popularity in the period 2003â€“04.[27] A typical crunk track uses a drum machine rhythm, heavy bassline, and shouting vocals, often in call and response manner.[27]
