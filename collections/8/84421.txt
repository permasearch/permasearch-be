Studies demonstrate a correlation between brain size and intelligence, with larger brains predicting higher intelligence. It is however not clear if the correlation is causal.[32] The majority of MRI studies report moderate correlations around 0.3 to 0.4 between brain volume and intelligence.[33][34] In healthy adults, the correlation of total brain volume and IQ is ~ 0.4 [35] The correlation appears to be related to the known small correlation of height with intelligence, which can be explained almost entirely by greater brain volume.[36]
