On the anniversary of the first march, more than 100 rallies were held across the nation calling for stricter gun laws at the state level. In New York, Republican Governor George Pataki joined Democratic U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in a show of support for stricter gun laws.[12] Turnouts to the second Washington march and to further marches were diminished, with the 2001 march on Washington reporting about 200 in attendance.[13][14] The group did not plan demonstrations in Washington in 2002 or 2003, instead focusing its efforts in the states.[15]
