Unlike the other well-studied iron oxide-based nanoparticles, research on Mn-based nanoparticles is at a relatively early stage.[29] Manganese chelates such as Mn-DPDP enhance the T1 signal and have been used for the detection of liver lesions. The chelate dissociates in vivo into manganese and DPDP where the former is absorbed intra-cellularly and excreted in bile, while the latter is eliminated via the renal filtration.[30]
