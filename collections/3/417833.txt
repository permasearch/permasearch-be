Most soils have a dry bulk density (density of soil taking into account voids when dry) between 1.1 and 1.6 g/cm3, while the soil particle density is much higher, in the range of 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm3.[8] Little of the soil of planet Earth is older than the Pleistocene and none is older than the Cenozoic,[9] although fossilized soils are preserved from as far back as the Archean.[10]
