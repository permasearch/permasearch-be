The division between series of Pokémon is based on the English version openings of each episode, and may not reflect the actual production season. The English episode numbers are based on their first airing in the United States either in syndication, Kids' WB, or on Cartoon Network. (Other English-speaking nations largely followed either this order or the Japanese order). Subsequent airings of the English version follow the original Japanese order, except in the case of episodes which are no longer shown in English. The episodes that make up this portion of the series in Japan were subtitled Orange Islands Chapter (オレンジ諸島編, Orenji Shotō Hen).
