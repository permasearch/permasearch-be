The England v. Rest of the World XI series was initially recognised as a Test series by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, but the International Cricket Conference (ICC) stated at their 1972 meeting that the games should not be regarded as official Test matches. Wisden continued to include the matches as Tests until removing them for the 1980 edition against the wishes of the editor, Norman Preston.[7]
