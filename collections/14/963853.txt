However, this judgement was later reversed by a higher court.  In the precedent-setting[2] Swirsky v. Carey decision,[3]  which clarified the standard for proving copyright infringement, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the initial 2002 dismissal of the case, finding that that Swirsky's expert did in fact adequately define the similarities between the two songs.[4][5]  The lawsuit was reinstated in 2004;[6] Carey and Swirsky settled out of court in 2006.
