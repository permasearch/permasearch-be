Both big and little forms of endianness are widely used in digital electronics. The choice of endianness for a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness and many other design attributes to maintain backward compatibility. As examples, the IBM z/Architecture mainframes and the Motorola 68000 series use big-endian while the Intel x86 processors use little-endian. The designers of System/360, the ancestor of z/Architecture, chose its endianness in the 1960s; the designers of the Motorola 68000 and the Intel 8086, the first members of the 68000 and x86 families, chose their endianness in the 1970s.
