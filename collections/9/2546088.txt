Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden.[57] Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war,[58] returned by the West.[59] The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944â€“45, and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised.[45]
