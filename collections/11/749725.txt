Porter's musical breakthrough occurred following his appearance in the 2004 semi-autobiographical musical, Nat King Cole & Me,[7] a show that he wrote, and that enjoyed an eight-week run in Colorado.[4] He first had the idea of recording a tribute album to Cole around 25 years before the project eventually came to fruition, but began to seriously plan its recording a year or so before its release. He has said that he mentioned his wish to record an album of Nat King Cole songs to Cole's daughter, Natalie when the pair met at a concert she was giving at London's Royal Albert Hall, and she encouraged him to do it.[5]
