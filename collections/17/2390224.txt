On April 10, Presley confidently announced during a radio interview that his debut feature would be The Rainmaker with Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn.[9] However, despite this belief, and due to Wallis being unable to find a project "good enough for the debut of Elvis Presley", he was loaned out to 20th Century Fox on August 13 and began work on Love Me Tender on August 22.[10] Presley's role had originally been turned down by both Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner[4] because the part was too small, but when Presley signed up to the picture the role was expanded to take advantage of his current popularity.[4] A somewhat more realistic film telling the story of the Reno Brothers, Rage at Dawn starring Randolph Scott, had been released by RKO Radio Pictures only the year before.[4] According to Presley's then girlfriend, June Juanico, he was reluctant to take the role after realizing that his character died at the end,[4] but he was persuaded to do it after she told him that the characters audiences were most likely to remember were the ones who had a tragic fate.[4]
