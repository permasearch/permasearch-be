There are four isozymes of pyruvate kinase in vertebrates: L (liver), R (erythrocytes), M1(muscles, hearts and brain) and M2 (only form detectable in early fetal tissue and present in most adult tissues). R and L isozymes differ from M1 and M2 in that they are both exclusively allosterically and reversibly regulated. From a kinetic standpoint, the R and L isozymes of pyruvate kinase have two key conformation states; one with a high substrate affinity and one with a low substrate affinity. The R-state, characterized by high substrate affinity, serves as the activated form of pyruvate kinase and is stabilized by PEP and FBP, promoting the glycolytic pathway. The T-state, characterized by low substrate affinity, serves as the inactivated form of pyruvate kinase, bound and stabilized by ATP and alanine, causing phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase and the inhibition of glycolysis.[2]
