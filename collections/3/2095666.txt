On 16 August, Barcelona lost 2–0 (agg. 1–5) to Real Madrid in the second leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España. The first goal of the match came quite early through a Real throw-in the fourth minute which resulted into getting the ball to Marco Asensio, who scored from long range. Nine minutes after the half-hour mark, Marcelo crossed in for Karim Benzema to control, who finished it with a half-volley into the net which was enough for the win for Real.[19]
