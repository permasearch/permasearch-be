"Hung Up" was ranked at number 76 on Rolling Stone's "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" decade-end list, calling it "One of her [Madonna's] most captivating hits ever — and thanks to those deceptively hard-hitting lyrics, one of her most personal."[33] NME ranked it at number 39 in their list of the best tracks of 2005.[34] Slant Magazine's writers listed the song at number 36 on their list of Best of the Aughts: Singles saying: "'Hung Up' employs a ticking clock to represent fear of wasted time, but Madonna isn't singing about aging or saving the world—she's talking about love. It had been years since Madge sounded this vapid. With its pitched-upward vocals, infectious arpeggio sample from ABBA's 'Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),' and the bridge's unironic, archetypical key change, the track decidedly points to the past, and it proved that, 20 years into her career, Madonna was still the one and only Dancing Queen".[35] The song was also named the 26th best single of 2005 by Pitchfork Media.[36] Stylus Magazine included "Hung Up" on their ranking of the best singles from 2005 at number 11.[37] In 2016, "Hung Up" was named in the online poll by Digital Spy, as "The Biggest Pop Song of the 21st Century".[38]
