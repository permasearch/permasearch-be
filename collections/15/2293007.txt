One of the Famitsu reviewers for the PSP remake was a little critical, saying that long load times when entering battles and the lack of guidance were among minor things that "niggled me". Despite this, features such as the ability to switch soundtracks and the Theatre Mode were praised.[38] Petit was highly critical of the remake, citing the gameplay as "Tedious [and] repetitive", referred to the Rumor system as "dull", and generally felt that the game had not aged well.[36] Ingenito also noted long loading times, along with a very high encounter rate and low-quality graphics carried over from the original.[7] McCarroll commented that many of the remake's faults stemmed from the expectations for an RPG when the original was released.[40] Welhouse shared multiple criticisms with other reviewers, despite generally enjoying the experience.[39]
