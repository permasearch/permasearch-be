The two actors who portrayed Earp's Cheyenne friends and informers were Rico Alaniz, a native of Mexico, Mr. Cousin in 19 episodes between 1955 and 1959, and Rodd Redwing as Mr. Brother in eight episodes. The role of Mr. Brother ended with the 1958 episode "One" because the character is killed by four outlaws called the Dry Gulch Gang. Earp spent several subsequent episodes entitled "Two", "Three", and "Four" apprehending the gang.[24]
