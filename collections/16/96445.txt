The gameplay is based on that of Mount & Blade: Warband, with similar controls in regards to melee and archery. Like its predecessors, With Fire and Sword is an action role-playing game. This installment allows the player to fight for one of five factions in an effort to control Eastern Europe, however only three have a proper storyline. The game is set in a later, more modern period than earlier titles with access to pistols, grenades, and other equipment of the post-medieval era.[1]
