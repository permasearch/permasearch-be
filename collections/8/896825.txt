As the stadium is owned by the City of Toronto, their consent is required for any modifications.[50]  The City insisted that any renovations included making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season.[51][52][53][54]  Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said "I think I have Mr. Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan and that we need to get the Argos on stable ground."[55]  Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly said that "the Argos have got to play there" and that "I think there is a very good chance that they will."[56]  On February 25 Grimes said that a deal was "getting close" and could be reached "in the next couple weeks".[57]  Preliminary plans were released to the public on March 5.[58][59]
