In 1950 Rohmer made his first 16mm short film, Journal d'un scélérat. The film starred writer Paul Gégauff and was made with a borrowed camera. By 1951 Rohmer had a bigger budget provided by friends and shot the 35mm short film Présentation ou Charlotte et son steak. The 12-minute film was co-written by and starred Jean-Luc Godard.[9] The film was not completed until 1961.
