On most horizontal wind turbine farms, a spacing of about 6â€“10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld. However, for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economical, taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs. This conclusion has been reached by research[61] conducted by Charles Meneveau of the Johns Hopkins University,[62] and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium, based on computer simulations[63] that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines (wakes) as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer.
