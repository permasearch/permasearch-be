In Luke, apparently written for gentiles, Jesus is especially concerned with the poor.[39] Luke emphasizes the importance of prayer and the action of the Holy Spirit in Jesus's life and in the Christian community.[40] Jesus appears as a stoic supernatural being, unmoved even by his own crucifixion.[41] Like Matthew, Luke insists that salvation offered by Christ is for all, and not only for the Jews.[40][42] The Gospel of John is the only gospel to call Jesus God, and in contrast to Mark, where Jesus hides his identity as messiah, in John he openly proclaims it.[43] It represents Jesus as an incarnation of the eternal Word (Logos), who spoke no parables, talked extensively about himself, and did not explicitly refer to a Second Coming.[39] Jesus preaches in Jerusalem, launching his ministry with the cleansing of the temple. He performs several miracles as signs, most of them not found in the synoptics. The Gospel of John ends:(21:25) "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
