The relation between the magnetizing field H and the magnetic field B can also be expressed as the magnetic permeability:     μ = B  /  H   {\displaystyle \mu =B/H}   or the relative permeability      μ  r   = μ  /   μ  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{r}=\mu /\mu _{0}}  , where      μ  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}   is the vacuum permeability. The permeability of ferromagnetic materials is not constant, but depends on H. In saturable materials the relative permeability increases with H to a maximum, then as it approaches saturation inverts and decreases toward one.[2][3]
