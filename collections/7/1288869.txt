Strong free speech protections of the Oregon Constitution upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Henry,[242] specifically found that full nudity and lap dances in strip clubs are protected speech.[243] Portland has the highest number of strip clubs per-capita in a city in the United States, and Oregon ranks as the highest state for per-capita strip clubs.[244] In addition to its strip clubs and erotic massage parlors, the city also has a high rate of child sex trafficking.[245][246]
