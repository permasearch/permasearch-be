Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May,[78] when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness.[5] Essentially, her life had fallen apart.[79] The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother's family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state.[78] Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister.
