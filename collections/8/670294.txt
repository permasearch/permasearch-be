They taught me the values of working hard".[17] He became a regular bouncer for clubs until he was arrested after a fight that left two patrons injured, one of whom was rendered unconscious.[18] After a trial, he was sentenced to one year of probation.[18] He also worked as a lifeguard[19] before pursuing a career in bodybuilding.[18] He credits bodybuilding with potentially saving his life.[20]
