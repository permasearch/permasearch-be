In healthy females AMH is either just detectable or undetectable in cord blood at birth and demonstrates a marked rise by three months of age; while still detectable it falls until four years of age before rising linearly until eight years of age remaining fairly constant from mid-childhood to early adulthood – it does not change significantly during puberty.[28] The rise during childhood and adolescence is likely reflective of different stages of follicle development.[21] From 25 years of age AMH declines to undetectable levels at menopause.[28]
