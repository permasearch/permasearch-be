Although mines and torpedoes constantly threatened the battleship's dominance, it was the refinement of aerial technology and tactics that led to the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the most important naval vessel. Initially, the large scale use of aircraft in naval combat was underrated and the idea that they could destroy battleships was dismissed. Still, the United States and the Japanese Empire experimented with offensive roles for aircraft carriers in their fleets.[14] One notable early military science pioneer of aviation in naval role was US Army General Billy Mitchell, who commandeered SMSÂ Ostfriesland for testing of his theory in July 1921. Though these tests did not impress his contemporaries, they forced the US Navy to begin diverting some of its budget towards researching the matter further.[15] The belief that the aircraft carrier was junior to the battleship began to evaporate when the Imperial Japanese Navy, in a surprise attack, destroyed nearly the entire United States Pacific Fleet at anchor at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 solely by air power.[16] The captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann, had almost dodged the Royal Navy until he was undone by British reconnaissance aircraft. Although almost every sea battle in World War Two involved gunfire between surface warships to some degree,[17] their time as the senior ship of a nation's fleet had run its course.
