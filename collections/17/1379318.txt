Temple invited fourteen-year-old Rudolph to join his summer training program at Tennessee State. After attending the track camp, Rudolph won all nine events. She entered at an Amateur Athletic Union track meet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3] Under Temple's guidance she continued to train regularly at TSU while still a high school student. Rudolph raced at amateur athletic events with TSU's womenâ€™s track team, known as the Tigerbelles, for two more years before enrolling at TSU as a student in 1958.[7]
