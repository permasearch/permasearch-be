The Humanity Party, a registered political party in the United States, is represented by "Anonymous." It also uses the Guy Fawkes mask. This has led some to criticize the Humanity Party for its possible connection to "hackers": "[H]acktivists are asking US voters to write the word 'Anonymous' in the write-in space on their ballots."[30]
