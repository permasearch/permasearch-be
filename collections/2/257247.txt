Prevention is by eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking.[9] Sometimes medication for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are also used.[9] There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms.[17] Treatment involves the same measures as prevention.[18][10] Additional medications such as antiplatelets including aspirin, beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended.[10] Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease.[10][19] In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improve life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.[20]
