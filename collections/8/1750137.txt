In Ireland, the use of surnames has a very old history. Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames[citation needed]. As noted in the Annals, the first recorded fixed surname was Ã“ Cleirigh, which recorded the death of Tigherneach Ua Cleirigh, lord of Aidhne in Co. Galway in the year 916.[17]
