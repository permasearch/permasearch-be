A revolver can be kept loaded and ready to fire without fatiguing any springs and is not very dependent on lubrication for proper firing.[22] Additionally, in the case of double-action-only revolvers there is no risk of accidental discharge from dropping alone, as the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull.[22] However, the revolver's clockwork-like internal parts are relatively delicate and can become misaligned after a severe impact, and its revolving cylinder can become jammed by excessive dirt or debris.[22]
