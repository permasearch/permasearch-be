On 2 June 1959, Alwyne Cecil Peareth Kincaid-Lennox petitioned the Lord Lyon King of Arms to succeed to the coat of arms of his great-great-grandfather, John Kincaid of Kincaid, who had matriculated his Arms and Supporters on 29 July 1808.[3] This John Kincaid of Kincaid married secondly Cecilia Lennox of Woodhead and their son, John Lennox Kincaid, became the legal representative of both the Kincaid and Lennox families upon the death of John Kincaid of Kincaid on 7 February 1832. John Lennox Kincaid Lennox had his coat of arms, the impaled arms of Lennox and Kincaid, matriculated on 12 June 1833.[4] John Lennox Kincaid Lennox died without male heirs and the Kincaid of Kincaid name and coat of arms became dormant. Alwyne Cecil Peareth Kincaid-Lennox's petition was granted and he was recognised as chief of the name of Kincaid by the Lord Lyon King of Arms on 1 July 1959.[5] He took on the name Alwyne Cecil Kincaid of Kincaid and began participating in activities to promote Kincaid as a new Scottish Clan.[6]
