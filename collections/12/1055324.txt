The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination, with historical confessional roots in the Reformed, Congregational and evangelical Protestant traditions, and "with over 5,000 churches and nearly one million members".[2][3] The United Church of Christ is a historical continuation of the General Council of Congregational Christian churches founded under the influence of New England Puritanism.[4] Moreover, it also subsumed the third largest Reformed group in the country, the German Reformed.[4] The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Christian, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. At the end of 2014, the UCC's 5,116 congregations claimed 979,239 members, primarily in the United States.[5] In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 0.4 percent, or 1 million adult adherents, of the U.S. population self-identify with the United Church of Christ.[6]
