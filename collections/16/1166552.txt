During his stay in Comodoro Rivadavia, Corporal Lou Armour befriended two English-speaking Argentine conscripts, Edgardo Blaguerman and Mariano Tantignone at the Liceo Militar General Roca that had been converted into a Prisoner of War Camp.[61] In 2017, Armour agreed to return to Argentina to take part in the Argentine play Minefield that brought the former enemies together in a reconciliation move.[30]
