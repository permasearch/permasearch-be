The annual Smokefree GB survey, published in May 2017, concluded that 52% of the 2.9 million British e-cigarette users are now ex-smokers. 26% of respondents thought e-cigarettes were as harmful as real cigarettes[15]. In March 2017, it was reported by The Telegraph UK's e-cigarette boom is on a decline, with the number of people using e-cigarettes in Britain decreasing for the first time since their launch.[16]
