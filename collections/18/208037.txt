At the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, and shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, (in 1869) a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Summit, Utah. Once completed, hundreds of thousands of United States citizens were enabled to easily migrate Westwards into the state.
