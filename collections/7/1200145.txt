Stoke City went into their first FA Cup Final as underdogs according to their manager Tony Pulis,[10] while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini saw in-form Stoke's underdog tag as a risk for complacency from his side.[59] There were fitness doubts over key players for both teams, Carlos Tevez for Manchester City,[60] and Matthew Etherington for Stoke City, who suffered a hamstring tear only 17 days prior to the final,[61] but both were able to start the match. However, Stoke City's underdog tag proved true as Mancini's Manchester City side had the better of the match, with a 59 per cent share of ball possession and 23 attempts on goal to Stoke City's nine, only one of which was on target.
