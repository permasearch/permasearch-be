Its other notable geographic feature is its proximity to the lowest site of subjugation of the River Forth. Control of the bridge brought military advantage in times of unrest and; excise duty, or pontage dues[27] in peacetime. Unsurprisingly excise men were installed in a covered booth in the centre of the bridge to collect tax from any entering the royal burgh with goods.[28] Stirling remained the river's lowest reliable crossing point (that is, without a weather-dependent ferry or seasonal ford[29]) until the construction of the Alloa Swing Bridge between Throsk and Alloa in 1885.[30]
