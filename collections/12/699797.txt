The sheriff's office received a number of tips in 2016 and 2017 about Cruz's threats to carry out a school shooting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation learned that a YouTube user with the username "nikolas cruz" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but could not identify the user. In January 2018, a direct complaint of a death threat by Cruz was not forwarded to the local FBI office by the FBI tip line.
