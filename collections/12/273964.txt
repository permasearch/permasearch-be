There are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.[15][30] The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically flu-like viral syndromes, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, chest pain, and migraine or other headaches.[91] Carbon monoxide has been called a "great mimicker" due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific.[15] Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include acute respiratory distress syndrome, altitude sickness, lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, meningitis, methemoglobinemia, or opioid or toxic alcohol poisoning.[30]
