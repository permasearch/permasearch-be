Published in Science in 1961, Julius Axelrod found an N-methyltransferase enzyme capable of mediating biotransformation of tryptamine into DMT in a rabbit's lung.[72] This finding initiated a still ongoing scientific interest in endogenous DMT production in humans and other mammals.[73][80] From then on, two major complementary lines of evidence have been investigated: localization and further characterization of the N-methyltransferase enzyme, and analytical studiesÂ looking for endogenously produced DMT in body fluids and tissues.[73]
