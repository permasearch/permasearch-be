The World Health Organization declared TB a "global health emergency" in 1993,[13] and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015.[86] A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.[13] A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs.[87]
