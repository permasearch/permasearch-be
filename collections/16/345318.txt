The Wapol Pirates (ワポル海賊団, Waporu Kaizokudan) are led by Wapol, the former King of Drum Island. He ate the Paramecia-type Munch-Munch Fruit (バクバクの実, Baku Baku no Mi) which allows him to eat virtually anything and take on its properties. His crew  consists mostly of his former army. His closest underlings are Chess, who is a skilled archer, and Kuromarimo whose fighting style revolves around throwing parts of his Afro hair-cut.
