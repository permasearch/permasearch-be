Meanwhile, Penang Island was first documented by Chinese sailors of the Ming dynasty in the 15th century. At the time, Ming Emperor Yongle was in the midst of launching naval expeditions that would eventually reach all the way to eastern Africa. The island, known as Bīnláng Yù (simplified Chinese: 梹榔屿; traditional Chinese: 梹榔嶼), was mapped by Admiral Zheng He's fleet in the 'Nautical Charts of Zheng He'.
