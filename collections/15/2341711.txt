According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises.[56] Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment.[56] Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.[56] Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in acceptance and commitment therapy.
