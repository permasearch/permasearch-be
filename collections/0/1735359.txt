Troy Barnes (Donald Glover), (seasons 1-5) born December 4, 1989, is a former high school football star and Greendale Community College student.[8] Born and raised in Greendale, Colorado, and raised a Jehovah's Witness, Troy spent two years in fifth grade, but believed it was normal after his mother told him that everyone is "ten for two years". He later made a name for himself as the varsity quarterback of his high school football team, and was also prom king. His numerous admirers at school included future Greendale peer Annie Edison. Troy's status at Riverside High prompted him to wear his Letterman jacket for days after his initial enrollment at Greendale. Jeff quickly inferred that this was a sign of Troy's insecurity. He is also afraid of tarantulas, rats, centipedes, lakes ("Environmental Science") and automatic toilets ("Critical Film Studies").[8] He injured himself during a "keg flip" (much harder to pull off than a keg stand) in high school that cost him a football scholarship, an injury he later revealed to be intentional because he could not take the pressure of a talent scout at a big game. He now plays quarterback for the nonathletic Greendale Human Beings, saying he would rather play football for fun.[8]
