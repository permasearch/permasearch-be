Rory Brown is the only homosexual in the family, a fact acknowledged by all of his family members except his mother, who seemed completely oblivious to the fact until she realises this with Cathy's intervention in "Mammy of the Groom". Rory is not married, up until the end of Season 3, when he gets married to fellow hairdresser Dino Doyle, in a private ceremony.
