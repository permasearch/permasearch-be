By April 1974, the band changed its name to "Noy's Band" and added bass guitarist Alan Ronds to be signed to the Dawn label. As Noy's Band the group released only one single, a reinterpretation of "Love Potion Number 9" paired with Noy's original piece "Eldorado". When this release flopped the band began to unravel, finally disbanding in August 1975. Noy, Dellar, and McElroy then joined with musician Nick Griffiths to perform briefly as punk band, Rip Snorter, through 1976 and the start of 1977.
