Docherty had been popular with the fans, and the new manager, Dave Sexton, needed success to dispel the unfavorable comparisons. Sexton's track record was impressive â€“ he had won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup with Chelsea and taken unfancied Queens Park Rangers to the brink of the league title. He had rejected United's first approach for him to become manager in 1971, and had been linked with the job as long ago as 1969 when Busby's retirement was first announced.
