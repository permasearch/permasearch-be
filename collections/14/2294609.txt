Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic.[115] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett does not carry a mobile phone, does not have a computer at his desk, and drives his own automobile,[116] a Cadillac DTS.[117] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he said he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[118] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life.[119] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald, which his company acquired in 2011.
