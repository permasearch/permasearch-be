A new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself "Shahenshah", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed a bit later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as "one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself". A bit later, the mysterious Shahenshah reveals to the public that he is none other than Vijay. Frustrated and helpless at the corruption in the police force, Vijay has employed this new tack to get to the criminals. Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father.
