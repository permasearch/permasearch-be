In 2010, in an interview on VH1's Celebrity Rehab[116] with Staley's mother, Nancy McCallum, former Alice in Chains bass player Mike Starr said that he spent time with Staley the day before he died, as Starr's birthday was on April 4, 2002.[117] Starr claimed that Staley was very sick but would not call 911. The ex-bandmates briefly argued, which ended with Starr storming out. Starr stated that Staley called after him as he left: "Not like this, don't leave like this".[117][118] Since Staley is believed to have died a day later, on April 5, Starr expressed regret that he did not call 911 to save his friend's life; Starr reported that Staley had threatened to sever their friendship if he did. Starr was the last known person to see Staley alive.[117] "I wish I hadn't been high on benzodiazepine [that night], I wouldn't have just walked out the door", Starr said.[119][120] The interview ended with Starr apologizing to McCallum for not calling 911, but McCallum was insistent that neither she nor anyone in her family blamed Starr for Staley's death. She also told Starr: "Layne would forgive you. He'd say, 'Hey, I did this. Not you.'" With that said, Starr still blamed himself for the death of Staley.[117] Starr kept this story a secret until his appearance on Celebrity Rehab in February 2010.[121] During this same interview, McCallum also claimed that Staley had attempted rehab 13 times, although it is not clear whether any of these attempts were during his reclusive years.[117] Starr was found dead on March 8, 2011 as a result of prescription drug overdose.[122]
