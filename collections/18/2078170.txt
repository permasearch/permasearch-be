The exact nature of the substance that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never explicitly made clear. Fischer only described it as "soft [...] smelly [and] brown".[6] In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous; Television Without Pity reviewer M. Giant noted that the viewer only gets "the merest out-of-focus Blair Witch glimpse" of the substance.[7] Fischer also noted that one of the more interesting aspects of the episode was the "you [the audience] finally see Pam and Roy getting along."[6] She explained that this was because Roy and Pam returned from "a romantic vacation in the Poconos."[6]
