JC makes the plan to pin Scottie as voting out Rockstar and not Kaycee, planning to say Brett was the one vote. After Faysal invites everyone to his HoH room, he asks them who the one vote to evict Kaycee was. Scottie claimed it, then Brett did right after. Kaycee backed Brett up by saying she "felt the energy" around him. Scottie laughed at Kaycee saying she was a bad actor and said their whole production was "cute". The next day, JC continuted to try to convince Faysal that Scottie should be his real target by bringing up that Scottie wants Faysal out so he can be with Haleigh.
