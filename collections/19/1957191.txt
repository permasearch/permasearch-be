A style more melodic and more akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally represented during the NWOBHM.[114] The music of Def Leppard,[115] Praying Mantis,[116] White Spirit,[117] Demon,[89] Shy,[118] Gaskin,[119] Dedringer[120] and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock,[121] included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After the peak of the movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts.[122] These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.[123]
