Originally, the film was set to be released on November 2, 2012, but DreamWorks Animation pushed the film to November 21, 2012 to avoid competition with Pixar's upcoming film Monsters University, which in turn had been pushed to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 2.[27] Monsters University was then pushed to June 21, 2013, with Disney's Wreck-It Ralph taking its place.[28]
