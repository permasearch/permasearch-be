On the southbound side, across from the on-ramp, the southbound lanes split for exit 2E, set specifically for the eastbound alignment of NY 27. Shortly afterward the expressway crosses under both directions of NY 27 on separate bridges. After that, Seamans Neck Road becomes the service road to the expressway, running parallel to the east. There is a bridge over Clark Street in the nearby community of Massapequa, where West Seamans Neck Road, the southbound service road, ends. After a short distance, Seamans Neck Road ends at exit 3 for NY 105.[4]
