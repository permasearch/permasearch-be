From March 8 to March 15, the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent ballistic missiles within 46 to 65 km (25 to 35 nmi) (just inside the ROC's territorial waters) off the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung. This action was intended to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate into voting against Lee and Peng, which Beijing branded "absolutely identical in attempting to divide the motherland."[21] Similarly, Chen Li-an warned, "If you vote for Lee Teng-hui, you are choosing war."[22] The crisis came to an end when two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups were positioned near Taiwan.[23]
