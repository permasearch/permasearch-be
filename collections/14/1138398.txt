The Valois line looked strong on the death of Henry II, who left four male heirs.  His first son, Francis II, died in his minority.  His second son, Charles IX, had no legitimate sons to inherit.  Following the premature death of his fourth son Hercule FranÃ§ois, and the assassination of his third son, the childless Henry III,  France was plunged into a succession crisis over which distant cousin of the king would inherit the throne.  The best claimant, King Henry III of Navarre, was a Protestant, and thus unacceptable to much of the French nobility.  Ultimately, after winning numerous battles in defense of his claim, Henry converted to Catholicism and was crowned king, founding the House of Bourbon.  This marked the second time the thrones of Navarre and France were united under one monarch; as different inheritance laws had caused them to become separated during the events of the Hundred Years Wars.  The House of Bourbon would be overthrown during the French Revolution, replaced by a short-lived republic.
