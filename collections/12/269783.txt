As the player discovers later in the game, 4546B was host to an ancient alien race around one thousand years ago. They are referred to only as the "Precursor Race". The Precursors were not natives of the planet, they were there searching for a cure to a highly infectious bacterium known as "Kharaa" that they had become infected with on an unknown planet, and in their time had killed over 143 billion of their kind. After many experiments were conducted on the native fauna species, the Precursors discovered one species known as the Sea Emperor Leviathan - the game's largest creature and the being that has been telepathically communicating with the player throughout the game, a creature whose stomach enzyme known as "Enzyme 42" is capable of causing remission of Kharaa's symptoms.
