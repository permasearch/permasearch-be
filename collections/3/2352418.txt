According to a 2010 study by Klaus Martin Kopitz, there is evidence that the piece was written for the German soprano singer Elisabeth Röckel (1793–1883), later the wife of Johann Nepomuk Hummel. "Elise", as she was called by a parish priest (she called herself "Betty" too), had been a friend of Beethoven's since 1808.[11] In 2015 Kopitz published further sources about Beethoven's relationship to Elisabeth and the famous piano piece. It shows that she was also a close friend of Anna Milder-Hauptmann and lived together with her in the Theater an der Wien. The singer was the first who played the title role of Beethoven's opera Fidelio. In a letter to Elisabeth she called her indeed "Elise".[12]
