"Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord" (1889) echoes Jeremiah 12:1 in asking why do the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of the faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person ("Sir") capable of hearing the complaint but seemingly unwilling to listen.[18] Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.
