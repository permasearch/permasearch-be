Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability.[139][140] It does not, however, improve chances of survival.[139] Benefit is greater the earlier it is used.[139] Between three and four and a half hours the effects are less clear.[141][142][143] A 2014 review found a 5% increase in the number of people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term.[140] After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes.[141] These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.[144] There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.[145]
