For a boolean function of     n   {\displaystyle n}   variables       x  1   , â€¦ ,  x  n      {\displaystyle {x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}}}  , a sum term in which each of the     n   {\displaystyle n}   variables appears once (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a maxterm. Thus, a maxterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the disjunction operator. Maxterms are a dual of the minterm idea (i.e., exhibiting a complementary symmetry in all respects). Instead of using ANDs and complements, we use ORs and complements and proceed similarly.
