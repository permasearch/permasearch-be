The center of the early social structure was the family,[203] which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas.[204] The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death.[205] Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities.[citation needed]
