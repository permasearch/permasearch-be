Toussaint Louverture, a former slave and leader in the slave revolt, drove out the Spanish (from Santo Domingo) and the British invaders who threatened the colony. In the uncertain years of revolution, the United States played both sides off against each other, with its traders supplying both the French and the rebels.[58] The struggle within Haiti between the free people of color led by Andr√© Rigaud and the Haitians of African ancestry led by Louverture devolved into the War of the Knives in 1799 and 1800.[59][60] Many surviving free people of color left the island as refugees.
