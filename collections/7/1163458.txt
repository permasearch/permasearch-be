By the turn of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with political graft, and the three parks became dilapidated.[3] As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System.[3] Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture,[3] improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features.[3] Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive.[3] By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed.[3] The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues.[3] Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south.[3] Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.[6]
