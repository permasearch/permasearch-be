Page faults, by their very nature, degrade the performance of a program or operating system and in the degenerate case can cause thrashing.  Optimization of programs and the operating system that reduce the number of page faults improve the performance of the program or even the entire system. The two primary focuses of the optimization effort are reducing overall memory usage and improving memory locality. To reduce the page faults in the system, programmers must make use of an appropriate page replacement algorithm that suits the current requirements and maximizes the page hits. Many have been proposed, such as implementing heuristic algorithms to reduce the incidence of page faults.  Generally, making more physical memory available also reduces page faults.
