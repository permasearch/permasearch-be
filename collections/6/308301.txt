Leslie Uggams said that she was in the film in July 2015, portraying Blind Al.[23] Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays "The Recruiter", and "did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet". Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film because, as a fan of the character, he had never felt that Cudmore's version was accurate to the comics and wanted to show the character as "this monstrous guy".[7] Andre Tricoteux had been cast in the role, providing motion reference on set and the voice.[22][21] In December, the voice of Colossus was revealed to have been recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.[21]
