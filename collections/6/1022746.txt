In "Backstopped", having survived the shooting and taken time off to recover, Hetty officially returned to work. She also revealed to Callen that she knew his mother when she was a CIA agent and Hetty was her handler. However, during an operation in Romania, Clara Callen disappeared and reappeared only six years later with two children and no trace of his father. She contacted Hetty, saying that she had to get out of Romania. Although the CIA told Hetty not to bother, she decided to do it anyway. However, Clara was killed by the Comescus before Hetty arrived. Callen and his sister somehow arrived in the U.S. and Hetty found them, arranging for Callen to get out of foster care; however, she was too late for Amy, who was already dead.
