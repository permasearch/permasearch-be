One of Sikorski's political goals was the creation of a Central and Eastern European federation, starting with the Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation.[20] He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism.[21] That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year.[14] On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni.[14] In March 1941 he visited the United States; he would visit USA again in March and December 1942.[5][14]
