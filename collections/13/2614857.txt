Students spend the day at the workplace of a parent, relative, friend or volunteer host, witnessing first-hand the world of work, prompting early career planning, and enabling students to make informed decisions about their future goals and endeavours. The event also gives parents the opportunity to discuss career prospects with their children, and allows businesses to share knowledge, experience and advice around education, career choices and relevant skills required in todayâ€™s workplace.
