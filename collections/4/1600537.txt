Normal cylindrical projections of the sphere have     x = a λ   {\displaystyle x=a\lambda }   and     y   {\displaystyle y}   equal to a function of latitude only. Therefore, the infinitesimal element PMQK on the sphere projects to an infinitesimal element P'M'Q'K' which is an exact rectangle with a base     δ x = a δ λ   {\displaystyle \delta x=a\delta \lambda }   and height     δ y   {\displaystyle \delta y}  . By comparing the elements on sphere and projection we can immediately deduce expressions for the scale factors on parallels and meridians. (The treatment of scale in a general direction may be found below.)
