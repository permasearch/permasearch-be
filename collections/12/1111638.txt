Cook County has banned the possession of certain semi-automatic firearms that it has defined as assault weapons.[63][64] Residents must report to the county sheriff within 48 hours any firearms that are stolen, lost, destroyed, or sold or otherwise transferred. The sheriff may share this information with other law enforcement agencies.[65][66] Licensed firearms dealers must provide information to the county regarding purchasers and the guns they purchase, and receive approval before conducting sales.[67] An individual may not purchase more than one firearm in a 30-day period.[68] In a home where a person younger than 21 is present, all guns must be secured with a trigger lock, or stored unloaded in a locked container separate from the ammunition, or secured to the body of the legal owner.[69] In Cook County, local laws, such as those of Chicago, take precedence over county laws that regulate similar matters.[70] Cook County imposes a twenty-five dollar tax on the sale of any firearm by a retail dealer, in addition to the usual county sales tax. The county also has a tax on the sale of ammunition â€” five cents per round for centerfire ammunition and one cent per round for rimfire ammunition.[71]
