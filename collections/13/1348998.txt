The 767-200ER was the first extended-range model and entered service with El Al in 1984.[42] The type's increased range is due to an additional center fuel tank and a higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of up to 395,000 lb (179,000 kg).[41][43] The type was originally offered with the same engines as the 767-200, while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and General Electric CF6 engines later became available.[41] The 767-200ER was the first 767 to complete a non-stop transatlantic journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988 with an Air Mauritius flight from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Port Louis, Mauritius, covering 8,727 nmi (10,000 mi; 16,200 km).[3] The 767-200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide-body aircraft for long-haul routes such as New York to Beijing.[3][43] Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders.[1] As of July 2017, 25 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service.[127] The type's main competitors of the time included the Airbus A300-600R and the A310-300.[47]
