In 1988, Kasem left the show over contract concerns with ABC. Industry trade paper Billboard magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary, because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Casey's final AT40 show, the 940th in the series, aired on August 6, 1988. At no point during that final show did Kasem ever let on that any changes were afoot. However, he closed the show by telling the audience to catch him on the television show America's Top 10 and did not plug the following week's AT40 (since December 19, 1987, he had always plugged both during his signoff). The #1 song during Casey's final show in the original AT40 era was "Roll with It" by Steve Winwood.[14]
