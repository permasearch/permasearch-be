The National Diet is the legislature, the organ of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, consisting of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected from the people, who are the source of sovereignty.[7] The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch, and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.[8]
