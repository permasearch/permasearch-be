In Episode 81, a door on the large ship that landed in Blood Gulch opens and Grif's sister is introduced. She is referred to as Sister by both teams. She tells the Reds she joined in order to be reunited with Grif, and that Command had sent her as a new recruit since one team member will be promoted to replace their deceased commanding officer. However, in following episodes she is revealed to be colorblind and is actually part of Blue team; Grif subsequently sends her to the Blue Team to protect her from Sarge. While the Blues give her an orientation, Tex appears and expresses indignation at the fact that the Blue Team had acquired a new girl while she was absent. Later, Tex and Sister bond during a private conversation while Church and Tucker discuss the consequences of having two girls on the team.
