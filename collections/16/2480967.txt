Ajax were Celtic's first round European Cup opponents in September 1982. The first leg in Glasgow saw Ajax twice take the lead through goals from Jesper Olsen and Søren Lerby, but Celtic responded with strikes from Charlie Nicholas and Frank McGarvey to draw 2–2 on the night.[63] Celtic went into the second leg as underdogs, but an outstanding Charlie Nicholas goal and a last minute winner from George McCluskey saw the club progress 3–2 on aggregate.[64] Nicholas has since described his goal in Amsterdam as being "probably my all-time favourite".[65] Celtic were unable to keep up their winning form in the next round, and went out of Europe 3–2 on aggregate to Real Sociedad, largely due to poor defending.[66]
