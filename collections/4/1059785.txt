Individuals who attend meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses but are not involved in preaching are occasionally referred to in Watch Tower Society publications as "associates" or as being "associated with the congregation".[94][95][96] Attendance figures for Witness events include "Jehovah's Witnesses and associates";[97][98] such statistics may be cited for comparison of Witness numbers with membership figures of other denominations,[99][100][101] but only those sharing in their ministry are counted by Jehovah's Witnesses when reporting their official statistics.
