PTSD affects memory recall and accuracy.[34] The more the traumatic event is brought to conscious awareness and recalled, the less accurate the memory.[34] PTSD affects the verbal memory of the traumatic event, but does not affect the memory in general.[34] One of the ways traumatic stress affects individuals is that the traumatic event tends to disrupt the stream of memories people obtain through life, creating memories that do not blend in with the rest. This has the effect of creating a split in identity as the person now has good memories they can attribute to one personality and bad memories the can attribute to the "other" personality. For example, a victim of childhood abuse can group their good and happy experiences under the "pleasant" personality and their abuse experiences under one "bad or wicked" personality. This then creates a split personality disorder.[52] Individuals suffering from post traumatic stress disorder often have difficulty remembering facts, appointments and autobiographical details.[53] The traumatic event can result in psychogenic amnesia and in the occurrence of intrusive recollections of the event. Children with PTSD have deficits in cognitive processes essential for learning; their memory systems also under-performs those of normal children.  A study using the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test showed that individuals with PTSD scored lower than controls on the memory test, indicating a poorer general knowledge. The study revealed that 78% of PTSD patients under-performed, and where in the categories labelled "poor memory" or "impaired memory".[53]  PTSD patients were specifically worse at the prospective and orientation items on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test.
