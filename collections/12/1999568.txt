Confession of sins is made directly to God and not through man (except in asking for forgiveness from the victim of the sin). It is taught that sins are to be kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins[specify] in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives you, so they should also be asked for forgiveness.[36][37]
