The government then introduced the Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 73 of 1955), which sought to amend article 3. The new bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 9 December 1955, by H.V. Pataskar, then Minister of Legal Affairs, and sought to amend Article 3 of the Constitution. It was debated by the Lok Sabha on 12 and 13 December and passed in its original form on 13 December 1955. After being passed by the House, the Speaker substituted the bracket and words "(Eighth Amendment)" in clause I of the Bill by the brackets and words "(Fifth Amendment)", through a formal amendment. This Bill, as so changed, was considered and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 15 December 1955.[6]
