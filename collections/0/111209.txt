In Australia and New Zealand, the term SUV is not widely used, except by motoring organizations,[72] the press,[73] and industry bodies.[74] Passenger class vehicles designed for off-road use are known as "four-wheel drives", "4WDs", or "4Ã—4s". Some manufacturers do refer to their products as SUVs, but others invented names such as XUV,[75] (HSV Avalanche XUV or GMC Envoy XUV) or action utility vehicles (AUVs).[76] The term "AWD", or all-wheel drive, is used for any vehicle which drives on all four wheels, but may not be designed for off-road use. "Crossover" is a marketing term for a vehicle that is both four-wheel-drive and primarily a road car.
