Bollywood movies are not influential in many countries of South America, though Bollywood culture and dance is recognised. However, due to significant South Asian diasporic communities in Suriname[246] and Guyana, Hindi-language movies are popular.[247] In 2006, Dhoom 2 became the first Bollywood film to be shot in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[248]
