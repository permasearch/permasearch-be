By the end of the 14th century, with the birth of the intellectual movements and the Renaissance, many maps began appearing with fictitious islands located in the Atlantic. At this time commercial contacts were expanding to the west linking the Mediterranean with coastal communities along the Atlantic, in particular, Genovese, Florentine and Venetian traders and many Christian groups building converts to the faith.  This expansion placed the Kingdom of Portugal in a strategic place, where the seafaring Portuguese were eager to expand their realm and expand their influence socially, politically and in the eyes of the Christian hierarchy.  In this context, Prince Infante D. Henrique (1394â€“1460) took on an important role in coordinating official Portuguese efforts with his financial support, the construction of new ships and the development of the naval schools to harness seafaring knowledge and promote new technologies and their use.  Infante D. Henrique, or Henry the Navigator, is generally credited with motivating modern navigation and directing the discoveries during the age of exploration; for Azoreans he is one of their founding fathers.  He studied the sea, weather, ships, geography and trade routes and talked to the navigators and captains. He brought to his navigation school, which he founded at Sagres in 1416, cosmographers, mathematicians, cartographers, and learned men of the known sciences, as well as collecting maps, charts, books, and other forms of knowledge. His motivations were not selfless:  he was looking to the sea as a possible route to link up with the mythological Prester John, thereby encircling the Muslim world and driving them from northern Africa and the Holy Land. To accomplish this Infante D. Henrique derived funds from the trade in order to find a sea route to India. As leader of the religious-military organization, the Holy Order of Christ, its program of exploration, discovery, and settlement was tailored for this dual purpose.
