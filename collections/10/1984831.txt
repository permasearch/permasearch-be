The Browns won their seventh game in a row against the Bills in Cleveland.[23] Edgar Jones scored the Browns' first touchdown on the team's third offensive play on a 35-yard pass from Graham.[23] Motley fumbled on the Browns' next possession, however, and the Bills capitalized on the mistake.[23] After several running plays brought the ball to the Browns' 22-yard line, quarterback Jim Still threw to Al Baldwin for a touchdown that evened the score.[23] A Groza field goal and a short touchdown run by Motley later in the first quarter put the Browns up by 10 points at halftime.[23] Cleveland retained the lead for the rest of the game as end Mac Speedie caught touchdown passes in the third and fourth quarters.[23] Graham ended the game with 11 completions for 189 yards and two touchdowns.[23] Speedie, who was leading the league in receiving, added seven receptions for 140 yards.[23] While the Bills lost, second-string quarterback George Ratterman, who came in for Still in the second quarter, put in a strong performance, completing 13 passes for 174 yards.[23] His totals included a touchdown throw to Lou Tomasetti in the fourth quarter, when the game was out of reach.[23]
