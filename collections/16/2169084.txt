The primary competing scientific hypothesis is currently recent African origin of modern humans, which proposes that modern humans arose as a new species in Africa around 100,000–200,000 years ago, moving out of Africa around 50,000–60,000 years ago to replace existing human species such as Homo erectus and the Neanderthals with limited interbreeding: at least once with Neanderthals and once with Denisovans.[113][114][115][116][117] This differs from the multiregional hypothesis in that the multiregional model predicts interbreeding with local human populations in any such migration.[115]
