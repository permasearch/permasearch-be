The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from personal identity. Whereas "identity" is sameness,[2] self-hood implies a first-person perspective. Conversely, we use "person" as a third-person reference. Personal identity can be impaired in late stage Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the self is distinguishable from "others". Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy[3]) and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience.
