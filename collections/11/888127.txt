Every year it seems as new evidence is found that modern slavery is occurring. In 2007, the Brazilian Government freed more than 1,000 forced laborers from a sugar plantation.[51] In 2008, the Brazilian government freed 4,634 slaves in 133 separate criminal cases at 255 different locations. Freed slaves received a total compensation of Â£2.4 million (equal to $4.8 million).[52] Though they received monetary compensation for their government's inability to protect them, the emotional cost for former enslaved will forever remain with the individual.
