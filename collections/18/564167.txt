In Queensland, the situation is similar to Victoria. There are two types of legal motorised bicycle. For the first type, the electric motor must not be capable of generating more than 200 watts of power. For the second type, known as a "pedalec", the vehicle must comply with the European Standard for Power Assisted Pedal Cycles (EN15194).
