Biological control can affect biodiversity[14] through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species.[88] An introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species.[89] In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative impact on the native ecosystem; however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.[90]
