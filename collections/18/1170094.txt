Three atypical antipsychotics (lurasidone,[23] olanzapine[24] and quetiapine[25]) have also been found to possess efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression as a monotherapy. Whereas only olanzapine[26] and quetiapine[27][28] have been proven to be effective broad-spectrum (i.e. against all three types of relapseâ€” manic, mixed and depressive) prophylactic (or maintenance) treatments in patients with bipolar disorder. A recent Cochrane review also found that olanzapine had a less favourable risk/benefit ratio than lithium as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder.[29]
