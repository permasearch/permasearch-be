Robert's son Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet, who served as an officer in Loudon's Highlanders, had been captured at the Battle of Prestonpans in September 1745. He returned home to find Foulis Castle had been partially destroyed by Jacobites after the Battle of Falkirk. A few months after Falkirk the Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden by government forces. After the rising was suppressed, a Munro Independent Company under Harry continued to police the Highlands but was disbanded in 1748. Harry set about rebuilding the castle as it is today, incorporating what he could of the original building which now appears as a mansion house built in a formal Georgian style rather than the defensive fort it once was.[59]
