The Constitution was further amended in 2002, allowing a transfer or proposed transfer of reserves between statutory boards upon the passing of a resolution by the statutory board to add those reserves to its past reserves.[21] Finally, following amendments in 2004, statutory boards and Government companies are now allowed to transfer their surpluses either to the Government or to each other without the President's scrutiny.[22] A new Article 148I was also added, enabling the Government to transfer its past reserves to any statutory boards and Government companies without the President's consent.[23]
