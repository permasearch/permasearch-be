Older adults are prone to loss of muscle strength.[65][66] With more strength older adults have better health, better quality of life, better physical function[66] and fewer falls.[66] In cases in which an older person begins strength training, their doctor or health care provider may neglect to emphasize a strength training program which results in muscle gains. Under-dosed strength training programs should be avoided in favor of a program which matches the abilities and goals of the person exercising.[67]
