Sasuke is introduced in the third chapter of Naruto's manga as a young ninja assigned to become a member of Team 7 alongside Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno.[43] The trio are trained under the guidance of Kakashi Hatake.[44] Although Sasuke is antisocial, he starts caring about Naruto and Sakura.[45] During a mission, Sasuke awakens his Sharingan — his clan's inherited ability to see through illusions — which allows him to learn imperceptible movements at a superhuman rate.[46][47] It is revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. He, at the age of seven, survived the massacre of his clan perpetrated by his brother, Itachi, who spared Sasuke's life because he did not consider him worth killing.[48] Sasuke seeks strong fighting opponents to reassure himself his power is growing.[49]
