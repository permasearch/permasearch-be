From 1840 generally older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M훮ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill, invented in USA in the late 18th century, and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M훮ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M훮ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short term leases gave M훮ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.[citation needed]
