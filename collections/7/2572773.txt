Solicitorâ€“client privilege was initially a common law evidentiary principle similar to hearsay, but has since become recognized as a substantive rule that is constitutionally protected. This recognition began with R. v. Solosky (1979) where Justice Dickson, in tracing its history, regarded it as a "fundamental civil and legal right" that guaranteed clients a right to privacy in their communications with their lawyers even outside a courtroom.[7]
