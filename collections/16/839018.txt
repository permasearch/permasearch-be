Tara is later abducted by a delusional vampire who believes she loves him. He holds her captive for many days, even taking her to the mansion of Russell Edgington, for whom he works, where he plans to turn her into a vampire. She eventually escapes the vampire by tricking him into letting her drink his blood so she would have the power to smash his skull with one of the weapons that adorned the wall of their room. However this does not kill him and he comes after her, eventually being killed by Jason at Merlotte's. Tara ends up traumatized by her experience and after discovering that Jason had been the one who killed Eggs, cuts off her hair and leaves Bon Temps. In season 4, Tara has moved to New Orleans and working as a cage fighter, and is in a relationship with another fighter, Naomi. In the season 4 finale, Tara is shot in the head by Debbie. Sookie picks her up from a pool of her own blood, cradling her and screaming for help. Pam enters Sookie's house looking for Eric, and sees the dead bodies of Debbie and Tara on the floor.  At Sookie and Lafayette's behest, Pam turns Tara into a vampire.  Because half of her brain was previously missing before the healing process brought on by Pam's turning of her, not only is Tara now a vampire, but there is now a severe personality change. Tara and Pam become very close over the course of season 5 and Tara begins to deeply care for her new maker. At the end of the season, Tara rescued Pam from the Vampire Authority and the two shared a long, heartfelt kiss. Tara was killed at the beginning of season 7 by one of the wild Hep V vamps, while fighting to save her mother.
