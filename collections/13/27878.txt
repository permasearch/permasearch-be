Shore composed a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes.[23] The music for the series turned out to be a success and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing Schindler's List, Gladiator, Star Wars (1977), and Out of Africa respectively.[40]
