Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was scheduled on its "traditional" date. Robert Neyland, Tennessee's coach and namesake of the present Tennesse stadium, began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings. It was officially given the name Third Saturday in October in 1939.[7] Both Robert Neyland and Bear Bryant made the rivalry heated during their tenure at Tennessee and Alabama.[8]
