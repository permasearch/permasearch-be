Kara, a housekeeper android for Todd Williams and his daughter Alice,[47] escapes with her after he attacks them and leaves Kara a deviant.[48] The two travel across Detroit, intending to make it to Canada, which has no specific laws involving androids and where they will be safe. Kara and Alice befriend another android named Luther along the way, who joins them on their journey.[49][50][51] They seek the aid of an android sympathiser, who points them to Jericho to obtain passports.[52] They get caught up in the attack there, which may result in Luther, Kara, and Alice's deaths. Kara also learns that Alice is in fact an android, replacing the daughter taken away by Todd's wife.[36] They can make it to Canada by bus or boat, survive a recycling centre, or in either case die trying.[37]
