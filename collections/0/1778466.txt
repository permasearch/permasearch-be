Tin resists corrosion from water, but can be attacked by acids and alkalis. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals.[6] A protective oxide (passivation) layer prevents further oxidation, the same that forms on pewter and other tin alloys.[13] Tin acts as a catalyst when oxygen is in solution and helps to accelerate the chemical reaction.[clarification needed][6]
