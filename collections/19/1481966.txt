The literal meaning of the Arabic word kaʿbah (كَعْبَة) is "cube."[7] In the Quran, the Kaaba has been also mentioned as "al-Bayt" (Arabic: البیت, the house), "al-Bayt al-Haram" (Arabic: البیت الحرام, the sacred house), "al-Bayt al-'Atiq" (Arabic: البیت العتیق, the old house), and "al-Bayt al-Muharram" (Arabic: البیت المحرم, respected house). The mosque surrounding the Kaaba is called al-Masjid al-Haram. According to some reports, in ancient times, the Kaaba was also called Qadis (Arabic: القادس, holy), Nadhir (Arabic: الناذر).
