The Brahma-students say: Is Brahman the cause? Whence are we born? Whereby do we live, and whither do we go? O ye who know Brahman, tell us at whose command we abide, whether in pain or in pleasure.  Should time, or nature, or necessity, or chance, or the elements be considered as the cause, or he who is called the Purusha? It cannot be their union either, because that is not self-dependent,[21]  and the self also is powerless, because there is, independent of him, a cause of good and evil.
