Early skyscrapers emerged in the US as a result of economic growth, the financial organization of American businesses, and the intensive use of land.[1] New York was one of the centers of early skyscraper construction, and had a history as a key seaport located on the small island of Manhattan, on the east coast of the US.[2] As a consequence of its colonial history, New York real estate was broken up into many small parcels of land, with few large sites.[3] During the first half of the 19th century it became the national center of American finance, and the banks in the financial district of Wall Street competed fiercely with English institutions for international dominance.[4]
