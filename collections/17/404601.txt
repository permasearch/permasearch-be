In May 2012, Mads Mikkelsen began talks to play one of the villains in the film and Anthony Hopkins, who played Odin in the first film, committed to returning in the sequel.[23][80] At the end of the month, Disney moved up the release date for the film a week ahead of the previous date to November 8, 2013.[81] By June 2012, much of the first film's supporting cast was confirmed to return, including Idris Elba,[26] Jaimie Alexander,[42] Ray Stevenson[36] and Stellan Skarsgì±…rd.[24] Also in June, Joshua Dallas announced that he would not be reprising the role of Fandral.[82] Dallas had initially intended to return,[83] but had to bow out due to his commitment on the television show, Once Upon a Time,[82] and Zachary Levi was cast in his place.[38] Levi was originally up for the role in the first film but scheduling conflicts with Chuck forced him to drop out.[39]
