Ackbar is freed from captivity during a failed attempt by Rebel forces to capture Tarkin. Afterward he joins the Rebel Alliance and helps convince his people to support the cause, playing an integral part in persuading them to contribute their massive starships, the Mon Calamari cruisers, to the Rebel Alliance.[6] Starting with the rank of Commander, Ackbar helps design the B-wing, a powerful line of starfighters, which prompt Rebel leader Mon Mothma to promote him to admiral.[8] Following events in the film Star Wars, including the destruction of the Death Star, Ackbar helps the other Rebel leaders establish new bases of operation and manage a Rebel mobile task force in starships spread across the galaxy.[9] He rises up the ranks until Mothma promotes him to commander of the entire Rebel fleet and head of military operations, as well as one of her top advisers.[7]
