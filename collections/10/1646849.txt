The inner membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that contains the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation. which contains the electron transport chain that is found on the cristae of the inner membrane and consists of four protein complexes and ATP synthase. These complexes are Protein complex I (NADH:Coenzyme Q Oxidoreductase), protein complex II (Succinate:Coenzyme Q Oxidoreductase), protein complex III (Coenzyme Q: Cytochrome C Oxidoreductase), and protein complex IV (Cytochrome C Oxidase).[6]
