Swarm Island only contains one attraction, The Swarm, a rollercoaster which opened in 2012 themed around multiple crash sites depicting scenes of apocalyptic devastation. The theme is that there has been an alien invasion in the theme park and the alien creatures simply known as 'The Swarm' are interacting with the guests and destroying the landscape of the area.
