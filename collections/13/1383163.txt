Approximately 9,000 residents and 550 National Guardsmen sheltered in the Superdome as Katrina came ashore on August 28, 2005. Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau, Adjutant General for the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome rose to around 15,000â€“20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people from areas hit hard by the flooding. Officials set up security checkpoints and confiscated alcohol, weapons, and illicit drugs from those seeking refuge in the building.[2]
