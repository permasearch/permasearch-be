The Lutheran Church of Sweden — which was the state religion until 2000 — has a registered membership of 6.1 million Swedish citizens, equal to 61.2% of the total population.[2] One reason for the high membership might be the fact that until 1996 all newborns with at least one parent being a member of the Church of Sweden were also registered as members of the church.[3] Yet the membership is declining rapidly, about 1% each year, falling from 95% in 1970 and 85% in 2000.
