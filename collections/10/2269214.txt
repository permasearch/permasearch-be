Despite its strong position in the market, E.A. Pierce was struggling financially in the 1930s and was thinly capitalized.[11] Following the death of Edmund C. Lynch in 1938, Winthrop Smith began discussions with Charles E. Merrill, who owned a minority interest in E.A. Pierce about a possible merger of the two firms. On April 1, 1940, Merrill Lynch, merged with Edward A. Pierce's E. A. Pierce & Co. and Cassatt & Co., a Philadelphia-based brokerage firm in which both Merrill Lynch and E.A. Pierce held an interest.[11] and was briefly known as Merrill Lynch, E. A. Pierce, and Cassatt.[12] The company became the first on Wall Street to publish an annual fiscal report in 1941.
