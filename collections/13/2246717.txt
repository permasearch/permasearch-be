Furstenfeld wrote "Hate Me" as a response to the way his drug addiction and depression damaged his relationships with his girlfriend Maime, for whom he wrote the song "Calling You". An authentic voicemail Furstenfeld received from his mother in which she expresses concern for whether he is doing well and taking his medication is featured at the beginning of the song.[2]
