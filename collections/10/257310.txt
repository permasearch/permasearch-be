Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes,[4] and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40Â million.[5] The 12 episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each.
