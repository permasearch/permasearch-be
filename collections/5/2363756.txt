Democrats stand united on the issue of climate change.[citation needed] Democrats argue for a decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels and advocate for the establishment of clean energy initiatives. The party believes that the United States, as one of the great global leaders fighting against climate change, should reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than 80 percent by 2050. Democrats also encourage the federal government to support the efforts negotiated from the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases “well below” two degrees Celsius by the end of this century.
