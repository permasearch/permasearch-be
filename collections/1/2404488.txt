By the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts had become a sensation worldwide.[4] Television producer Lee Mendelson acknowledged the strip's cultural impression and produced a documentary on the subject, titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown.[5] Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard a song by Vince Guaraldi on the radio not long after completion of his documentary, and contacted the musician to produce music for the special.[6] Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, "Linus and Lucy", to serve as the theme.[7] Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special.[7]
