Jon-Joseph "Jonjo" Kerr in Chorley, Lancashire[citation needed]; 27, is an infantry soldier in the Yorkshire Regiment, from Coventry (originally from Chorley, Lancashire). He was deployed to Afghanistan as part of his duties.[81] He sang "You Really Got Me" and was the first of the overs category to be eliminated from the live shows on 9 October by decision of mentor Louis Walsh, as there was no public vote in the inaugural live show. The public voted over 10â€“12 November for one act from the initial four eliminated from the first live show, including Kerr, to replace the expelled Frankie Cocozza, but Kerr lost out to Amelia Lily.[21]
