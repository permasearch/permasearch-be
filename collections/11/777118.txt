Since the colonial period, a number of purely Mexican twists have been added, starting with the use of Spanish moss covering the base.[4][6] The scene is missing the figure of the Child Jesus until Christmas Eve. Although all other images are generally proportional to the rest of the scene, the image of Jesus is much larger, almost that of a life sized baby. This image is not only central to the nativity scene but is also important to a tradition of bringing the image to church on February 2 to be blessed.[4]
