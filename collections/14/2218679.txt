Curium readily reacts with oxygen forming mostly Cm2O3 and CmO2 oxides,[46] but the divalent oxide CmO is also known.[59] Black CmO2 can be obtained by burning curium oxalate (Cm2(C2O4)3), nitrate (Cm(NO3)3) or hydroxide in pure oxygen.[29][60] Upon heating to 600–650 °C in vacuum (about 0.01 Pa), it transforms into the whitish Cm2O3:[29][61]
