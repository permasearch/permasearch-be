Prior to the Season 1 episode "The Man in the Fallout Shelter", none of the "squints" knew that Booth was a father. At the end of the episode, Booth introduces Parker to Bones and gives him a voice-activated robot Zack Addy had made for him as a Christmas present. Parker meets the rest of the Jeffersonian team as well as Sweets and Bones' father Max. Booth has brought him to the Jeffersonian several times and Angela becomes fond of him and nicknames him "Baby Booth".
