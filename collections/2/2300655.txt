Five of the album's seven tracks were intended for the shelved album LÃ¤ther. "Flambay" and "The Ocean Is the Ultimate Solution" originally appeared in significantly shortened versions, but are presented in their original edits on the released Sleep Dirt. Zappa's intended title for the album was Hot Rats III. The change in title by Warner was also in violation of Zappa's contract. When Zappa re-issued the recordings he did not change the title. The 1979 LP version of Sleep Dirt was entirely instrumental. However, with the CD release in 1991, Zappa added new overdubs to the recordings.
