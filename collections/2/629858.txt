Note also that in the case of the Bernoulli, binomial, categorical and multinomial distributions, the support of the distributions is not the same type of data as the parameter being predicted. In all of these cases, the predicted parameter is one or more probabilities, i.e. real numbers in the range     [ 0 , 1 ]   {\displaystyle [0,1]}  . The resulting model is known as logistic regression (or multinomial logistic regression in the case that K-way rather than binary values are being predicted).
