Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai (English: It's My Friend's Wedding) is a 2002 Indian Bollywood film directed by Sanjay Gadhvi and produced by Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films. The film starred Uday Chopra, Jimmy Sheirgill, Bipasha Basu and Tulip Joshi. The film was said to be partly inspired by My Best Friend's Wedding (1997).[1] The director Gadhvi, however, claims that he mainly drew from earlier Hindi films and that My Best Friend's Wedding only provided less than 1% of the inspiration for his film. The film did good business at the box office and was declared "Hit".[2]
