Howard Thompson of The New York Times praised the film's sense of humour, as did critic Roger Ebert, the latter of whom gave the film two-and-a-half out of possible four stars.[4][5] In a review published by Time Out, the film is called "first and best in the 'Trinity' series of spaghetti Westerns, rare in that it is successful in combining laughter and some degree of interest in the action".[6] In his book Once Upon a Time in the Italian West: The Filmgoers' Guide to Spaghetti Westerns, author Howard Hughes writes "They Call Me Trinity is Hill and Spencerâ€™s finest vehicle".[1]
