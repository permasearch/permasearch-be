In the U.S., the Finals were split between NBC and NBCSN, called by NBC Sports' lead commentary team of Mike Emrick, Eddie Olczyk and Pierre McGuire; it was originally announced that games two and three were to be broadcast by NBCSN, with the remainder on NBC. Game two was moved to NBC to serve as a lead-out for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of game four on NBCSN.[16] As Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he was absent during game two.[3][17][18]
