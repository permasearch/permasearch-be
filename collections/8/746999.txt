The Christchurch earthquake of 2011 had widespread mental health effects on the population.[250][251][252][253][254][255] Research following the Christchurch earthquakes has shown that increasing exposure to the damage and trauma of a natural disaster is correlated with an increase in depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[250][252][253][254] Those with the most exposure suffer the most from mental health deficits, compared with those that are relatively unaffected.[250][252][253][254] Increases in trauma exposure are related to increased dependence on alcohol and nicotine, as well as prescribed psychiatric medication.[250][251] This information is important to consider when reacting to future earthquakes and other natural disasters. There is evidence that suggests that the mental health effects of natural disasters can be debilitating and detrimental to the community affected.[250][251][252][253][254][255][256]
