The Irish republican party Sinn Féin follows a policy of abstaining from the House of Commons; this is because its members refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the British Parliament, as a body that legislates for Northern Ireland. The party is also opposed to the British monarchy, and as a result, even if its members wished to take up their seats, they would likely refuse to take the oath, and so would be denied the right to sit in Parliament. As absentees Sinn Féin MPs are denied their salaries, worth around £1.5 million over the five years to 2009, but can claim staff costs and additional accommodation allowances.[36]
