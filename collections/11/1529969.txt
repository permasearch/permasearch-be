Statistically, modern roundabouts are safer for drivers and pedestrians than both traffic circles and traditional intersections.[46] Roundabouts are safer than both traffic circles and junctionsâ€”experiencing 39% fewer vehicle collisions, 76% fewer injuries and 90% fewer serious injuries and fatalities (according to a study of a sampling of roundabouts in the United States, when compared with the junctions they replaced).[47] Some larger roundabouts take foot and bicycle traffic through underpasses or alternate routes. Clearwater Beach, Florida's multi-lane roundabout has reduced its previously high cyclist death rate to zero since its construction.[citation needed]
