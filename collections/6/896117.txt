The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has established a "sphere of influence" that includes the communities of Carmel Woods, Hatton Fields, Mission Fields, Mission Tract, Carmel Point and Carmel Hills. These neighborhoods are officially located in the unincorporated area of Monterey County, which provides most primary services, including law enforcement, street repairs and public transit. With the exception of several planned shopping areas at the mouth of Carmel Valley, these areas contain few, if any, ongoing businesses, and serve primarily as bedroom communities to Carmel-by-the-Sea and the greater Monterey Peninsula.[52]
