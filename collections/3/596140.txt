Lateral (from Latin lateralis, meaning 'to the side') refers to the sides of an animal, as in "left lateral" and "right lateral". The term medial (from Latin medius, meaning 'middle') is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the "median plane".[2] For example, in a fish the gills are medial to the operculum, but lateral to the heart.
