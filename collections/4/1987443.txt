During the period in 1831, J. Francisco Madero petitioned the Mexican government and was later granted complete navigation rights of the Rio Trinidad (Trinity River) for a term of 15 years.  The state could not impose any special tax on the ships â€“ it would be imposed on them by the impresario.  Liberty was represented at the Consultation in 1835 and granted a post office in 1836.
