In 1978, another kind of buried treasure was discovered when a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films on flammable nitrate film stock from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the permafrost. These silent-era film reels, dating from "between 1903 and 1929, were uncovered in the rubble beneath the old hockey rink".[5] This historical find was moved south to Library and Archives Canada and the U.S. Library of Congress for both transfer to safety film and storage. A documentary about the find, Dawson City: Frozen Time was released in 2016.[6]
