The encore was described by Bono as a "denouement" intended as an ode to women. Speaking about the inspiration behind the idea, Williams said, "The thought was that we are currently living in a time when we could really use a more feminine spirit in our leadership and a way to illustrate this might be to celebrate some of the great female pioneers of the past."[49] Bono wanted to find "the sort of women that aren't welcome, that President Trump doesn't want in America" and commissioned French artist JR to find such a person.[4] After traveling to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, he found a 15-year-old Syrian refugee named Omaima.[45][4] Performances of "Miss Sarajevo" were preceded by a clip of her speaking of America as a dreamland,[45] which Bono said "gives you a kick in the balls, but in the most velvet way".[4] The song was accompanied by footage of the camp's bleak conditions,[50] while audience members passed a large sheet of fabric printed with Omaima's passport photo around the venue.[46] For "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", the video screen displayed images of historical female figures and achievers. Prior to "One", Bono promoted the ONE Campaign by discussing the fight against HIV/AIDS.[45] Many concerts concluded with a performance of the new song "The Little Things That Give You Away", which will be included on the group's upcoming album Songs of Experience.[4] Another song from the album, the lead single "You're the Best Thing About Me", was also performed.[51] Some concerts closed with "I Will Follow", from the band's first album, Boy (1980).[51]
