Chelsea secure their fourth Premier League trophy and their fifth top division trophy overall, after a 1–0 victory over Crystal Palace. An Eden Hazard goal was enough to send the Blues 16 points clear and unable to be caught. This was José Mourinho's third Premier League and eight title overall. The title victory also put him level with Arsène Wenger in the second-most Premier League wins behind Alex Ferguson. Chelsea have spent 253 days at the top of the Premier League table to date this season, and only Chelsea in 2005–06 (257 days) and Manchester United in 1993–94 (262 days) have been at the top of the table for longer in a single campaign. Due to the Blues securing the title against Palace, Chelsea will spend 274 days at the top of the table and break a new record.[139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152]
