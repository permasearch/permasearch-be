The 1978 Regal could be equipped with a 3.8 L Turbocharged V-6 engine with automatic transmission and the sedan model was dropped, once again leaving Regals exclusively as coupes with the Century nameplate applied to bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons. Non-turbo versions were offered with either a 2-bbl or a 4-bbl carburetor. The Buick LeSabre was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Saab. The Turbo Regal also included a firm handling suspension with larger tires and sport wheels.
