Ridley Scott credits Edward Hopper's painting Nighthawks and the French science fiction comics magazine Métal Hurlant, to which the artist Moebius contributed, as stylistic mood sources.[72] He also drew on the landscape of "Hong Kong on a very bad day"[73] and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England.[74] The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia.[75] Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist who, like Scott, was influenced by Métal Hurlant.[76] Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of Blade Runner, but he declined so that he could work on René Laloux's animated film Les Maîtres du temps – a decision that he later regretted.[77] Production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film.
