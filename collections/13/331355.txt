Another early print reference is Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey, originally written 1798-1799. In the first chapter the young English heroine Catherine Morland is described as preferring "cricket, base ball, riding on horseback and running about the country to books".[14] About the same time, Austen's cousin Cassandra Cooke mentioned baseball in her novel Battleridge.
