The queue hosts a few interactive activities. One is a gem-sorting game where you match up three jewels of different shape but the same color. There is also a spot with barrels full of gems that you spin to create reflective animations of the Seven Dwarfs on the ceiling. If all of the dwarfs are present on the ceiling, an animation of Snow White appears in the middle of the Dwarfs' animations. Finally there are the "musical spigots," a gem washing station with wooden taps carved to woodland animals. There are 12 spigots each representing a note on the chromatic scale.[12]
