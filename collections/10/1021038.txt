In a separate interview, Jackson stated that while on the surface Lucky may not want the child to be his, deep down he thinks a part of the character does.[86] Elizabeth hopes Lucky is the father, thinking it is the only way she can salvage their relationship, and has a difficult time coming to terms with Lucky not wanting her anymore.[51] After Lucky finds her suffering from hypothermia in the church where they said their vows as teenagers, and later has to talk her down off the roof of the hospital, she is sent to Shadybrook sanitarium. This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: "The crisis that's going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don't have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky up to say, 'I need to get my stuff together because I need to be present for those kids.'"[78] Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, and they believe Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test.[53] Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship.[54] Still feeling lost, Lucky accepts an undercover assignment to pose as an Irish hitman named Ronan O'Reilly,[55] coincidentally his doppelg√§nger. Lucky works to take down "The Balkan", and meets Siobhan McKenna (Chambers), who initially puts an end to his romantic bad luck streak.[92] They face trouble when Siobhan is blackmailed by The Balkan and hides it from Lucky, who is sensitive to betrayal after Elizabeth's affair.[93] They eventually plan a green card marriage so that she can stay in the country with him. During their first ceremony, Lucky learns his son Jake has been in a hit-and-run accident, that eventually renders him braindead.[50] Jake's death sets another string of tragic events in motion. Lucky finds out his father was the driver, and accuses Luke of driving drunk. Lucky is adamant that his father is an alcoholic,[94] but Luke refutes that Lucky wants to blame the alcohol so that he does not have to blame him.[95] Lucky eventually stages an intervention, which only angers Luke.[56] Lucky tracks Luke down to the brothel where Luke grew up, but when Luke tells Lucky that it liberated him to kill Jake,[96] Lucky leaves. Distraught, he burns down his childhood home, accidentally injuring Siobhan. Elizabeth finds Lucky and tells him that he is Aiden's father, stopping Lucky from drinking.[97] In May 2011, Jackson spoke of the unending turmoil in Lucky's life:
