The trap is attached to the front of beehives. The effectiveness of the trap is determined by its ability to capture hornets while allowing bees to escape easily.  The wasp enters the trap and encounters resistance from bees or catches one. The hornet then tries to fly back through the entrance and hits the front of the trap. The hornet then flies upwards to escape and enters the capture chamber, where the hornets are left to die. The many problems with the trap makes it inefficient. Some hornets find a way to escape the trap through the front.[10]
