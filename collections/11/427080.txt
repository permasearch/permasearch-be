That month, Disney conducted test screenings of the half-completed film with two audiences (one made up of families and the other made up of adults)[71] in Phoenix, Arizona,[67] at which Lasseter and Catmull were personally present.[63][74] Lee recalled that it was the moment when they realized they "had something, because the reaction was huge."[74] Catmull, who had instructed Lee at the outset to "earn that ending," told her afterwards, "you did it".[63]
