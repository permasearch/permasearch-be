Tropical cyclone windspeed climatology is the study wind distribution amongst tropical cyclones, a significant threat to land and people. Since records began in 1851, winds from hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones have been responsible for fatalities and damage in every basin. Major hurricanes (Category 3 or above) usually cause the most wind damage.[1] Hurricane Andrew for example caused $45 billion (2005 USD) in damage, most of it wind damage.[2]
