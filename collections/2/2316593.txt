The immigration station at Angel Island was predominantly used to inspect, disinfect, and detain  Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian immigrants who sailed across the Pacific Ocean.[13] In addition to standard medical examinations, Chinese immigrants were inspected for parasitic diseases, and the tests for intestinal parasites required a stool specimen.[13] Immigrants described the examination and disinfection process as brutal, humiliating, and indecent.[11] Passengers who were found to be sick were sent to the hospital on the island until they could pass a medical examination and an immigration hearing.[12] Investigation processes determined the length of time an immigrant would stay at the station[17] and Chinese immigrants could be detained for a period as short as two weeks to as long as two years.[18] A person's racial identity and social class determined the intensity of the examination imposed, resulting in fewer white Europeans and American citizens being subjected to the inspections.[13]
