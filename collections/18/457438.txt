A traditional stereotype of heterosexual casual relationships in college is that the men initiate the sexual activity.[14] Another stereotype is that men are more sexually active and women link sex with romance. This is not true all the time, especially in college students.[14] A study conducted by Paul and her team suggests that when it comes to gender participation, there are just as many women initiating these relationships.[14] Pressure from friends and other social means may persuade college students to participate in a casual relationship or "hook-up" regardless of their gender.[14]
