In Britain today, nearly half of babies are born to people who are not married (in the United Kingdom 47.3% in 2011;[162] in Scotland in 2012 the proportion was 51.3%[163]). It is estimated that by 2016, the majority of births in the UK will be to unmarried parents.[164] The Victorian era of the late 19th century is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality. Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards and rejected cohabitation. They have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births in London slums. However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite lowâ€”under 5% -- for the working class and the urban poor.[165]
