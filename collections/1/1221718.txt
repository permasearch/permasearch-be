Often described as the "backbone of England",[2][3][4] the Pennine Hills form a more-or-less continuous range stretching northwards from the Peak District in the northern Midlands, through the South Pennines, Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines up to the Tyne Gap, which separates the range from the Cheviot Hills. Some definitions of the Pennines also include the Cheviot Hills while excluding the southern Peak District. South of the Aire Gap is a western spur into east Lancashire, comprising the Rossendale Fells, West Pennine Moors[5] and the Bowland Fells in North Lancashire.[6] The Howgill Fells in Cumbria are sometimes considered to be a Pennine spur to the west of the range.[7] The Pennines are an important water catchment area with numerous reservoirs in the head streams of the river valleys.
