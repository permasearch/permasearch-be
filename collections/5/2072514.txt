Impairment of neuroplasticity and altered levels of neuro-trophins are involved in bipolar disorder. NGF has been found to be decreased overall in bipolar disorder patients. More specifically, while in a manic state NGF is especially low. This leads to elevated or irritable mood with increased energy and decreased need for sleep while in a manic state. This decreased NGF may serve as a biological marker when assessing the present state of a bipolar disorder patient.[40] When bipolar disorder patients were treated with lithium, their NGF concentrations increased in the frontal cortex, limbic forebrain, hippocampus, and amygdala.[41]
