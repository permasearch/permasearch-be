I've generally found that liquors of any sort choke me, and it is only by occasion and rare temperament that they do not; however, Everclear has treated me differently, yet there is a different kind of choking caused by it because it is especially inflammatory to the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. I imagine you can find some medical journals on the effects of ethanol to such membranes, and perhaps it is best avoided. To decrease the time of such a strong spirit on the membranes I generally follow shots of Everclear with 8oz or more of water. It is hardly lethal, either by direct contact of the strong spirit or in absorption into bloodstream. 2.375 shots of a a 40% liquor one after another is equivalent in the stomach. â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.235.91.131 (talk) 15:43, 28 February 2010 (UTC)
