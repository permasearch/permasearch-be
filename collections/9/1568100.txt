Unaffiliated is a status for registered voters in New Jersey. Those voters who do not specify a political party affiliation when they register to vote are listed as unaffiliated.[7] Affiliated voters may change their status to unaffiliated or to another political party if they wish, although any such change must be filed with the state 55 days before the primary election.[7] As of 2017, there were 2.4 million unaffiliated voters in New Jersey, more than members of any party in the state.[8]
