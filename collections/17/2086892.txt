Galactus consumes Beta Ray Bill's Korbinite home world with the aid of new herald Stardust.[54] When the Negative Zone villain Annihilus declares war on the universe, the entity attacks and destroys the Kyln, freeing former Galactus foes Tenebrous and Aegis.[55] Sensing their release, Galactus temporarily releases Stardust from service and reemploys the Silver Surfer as his herald due to his familiarity with their old foes.[56] Aegis and Tenebrous, however, find and defeat the Silver Surfer and Galactus and deliver them to Annihilus.[57] Annihilus intends to use Galactus as a weapon to destroy all life in the universe, but is thwarted when the entity is freed by Drax the Destroyer. Galactus retaliates and destroys most of Annihilus' forces.[58] Seeking a final confrontation with Aegis and Tenebrous, Galactus sends the Silver Surfer to locate them.[59] The Surfer eventually draws the pair into the barrier between the universe and the Negative Zone, which destroys both.[23]
