Many products which imitated emanation activators were more broadly marketed to the public. One such product was the Revigator, a "radioactive water crock." A dispensing jar made of radium-containing ore, the idea was that radon produced by the ore would dissolve in the water overnight. It was advertised: "Fill jar every night. Drink freely . . . when thirsty and upon arising and retiring, average six or more glasses daily." The American Medical Association (AMA) was concerned that the public was being fleeced by charlatans. In response, the AMA established guidelines (in effect from 1916 to 1929) that emanators seeking AMA approval had to generate more than 2 Î¼Ci (74 kBq) of radon per liter of water in a 24-hour period. Most devices on the market, including the Revigator did not meet that standard.[41]
