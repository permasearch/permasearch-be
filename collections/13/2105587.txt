By the third series the Caroline and Kate have settled into a "life of domesticity", expecting a baby and planning their wedding.[1] In promoting the series, Lancashire explained that Caroline's happiness is tempered by her becoming "wounded by [an] admission of non-acceptance" from her mother after she refuses to attend Caroline's wedding.[1] Whilst unable to divulge the details of further plot developments, she noted that "catastrophic events" would re-unite Caroline and Celia and allow viewers to "see the full spectrum of who Caroline is."[1] In an interview with Diva magazine, writer Sally Wainwright explained that she felt that she had to kill off the character of Kate following the wedding, as she felt the only way Caroline and Celia could be reconciled would be through a family tragedy.[13] Whilst she had been conflicted over the decision, she felt that it was ultimately the best one for the drama and that it allowed "the performances with the people left behind [to] become increasingly magnetic and extraordinary".[13]
