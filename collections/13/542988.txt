While giving a deposit to a sperm bank, Shane learned that he was sterile. Shane was upset at the thought of never having children. His father and brothers tried to help by offering to be sperm donors for Kelly, but she refused. Liam Gallagher (Johnny Bennett) suggested Kelly and Shane raise Shane's niece Katie, but this plan was dashed when her father Lip Gallagher (Jody Latham) decided to take her. Shane was left to look on Liam as a son.[7]
