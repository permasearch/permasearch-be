The most carbon-rich meteorites, with abundances up to 7 parts per thousand by weight, are ureilites.[5]:241 These have no known parent body and their origin is controversial.[6] Diamonds are common in highly shocked ureilites, and most are thought to have been formed by either the shock of the impact with Earth or with other bodies in space.[5][7]:264 However, much larger diamonds were found in fragments of a meteorite called Almahata Sitta, found in the Nubian desert of Sudan. They contained inclusions of iron- and sulfur-bearing minerals, the first inclusions to be found in extraterrestrial diamonds.[8] They were dated at 4.5 billion-year-old crystals and were formed at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. The authors of a 2018 study concluded that they must have come from a protoplanet with a size between that of the moon and Mars but is no longer intact.[9][10]
