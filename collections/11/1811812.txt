Berne's theory was based on the ideas of Freud but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on patient's personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients' social transactions.[2] Berne mapped interpersonal relationships to three ego-states of the individuals involved: the Parent, Adult, and Child state. He then investigated communications between individuals based on the current state of each. He called these interpersonal interactions transactions and used the label games to refer to certain patterns of transactions which popped up repeatedly in everyday life.
