Mula is perhaps best known to Western filmgoers as the voice of the Diva Plavalaguna (played on-screen by Ma√Øwenn Le Besco) in the 1997 film The Fifth Element, where she is credited using her (then) married name as Inva Mulla Tchako. She performed the aria "Oh, giusto cielo!...Il dolce suono" (the mad scene) from Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and "The Diva Dance".
