The beetle is invasive in North America where it has a core population in Michigan and surrounding states and provinces. Populations are more scattered outside the core area, and the edges of its known distribution range north to the upper peninsula of Michigan, south to northern Louisiana, west to Colorado, and east to Massachusetts [10] In northern Europe, a population was found in Moscow, Russia in 2003.[8] From 2003 to 2016, this population has spread west towards Sweden at 40 km (25 mi) per year and is expected to reach central Europe between 2031 and 2036.[11][12][8]
