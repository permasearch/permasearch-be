In his catechism (entitled Explanation of the Apostles' Creed) (1533), Erasmus took a stand against Luther's teaching by asserting the unwritten Sacred Tradition as just as valid a source of revelation as the Bible, by enumerating the Deuterocanonical books in the canon of the Bible and by acknowledging seven sacraments.[56] He called "blasphemers" anyone who questioned the perpetual virginity of Mary.[57] However, he supported lay access to the Bible.[57]
