Farley launched a line, "Filthy Couture," in a Las Vegas, Nevada runway show in July 2010. After four months of operation, the line ceased sales in October 2010 due to a threatened trademark lawsuit.[8] Farley stated that the brand was not over and a new line would be released.[9] In April 2011, MTV announced that it ordered two Jersey Shore spin-off series, one of which will feature Farley and castmate Nicole Polizzi. Twelve episodes were ordered for the first season. In 2010 she released a book titled The Rules According to JWOWW: Shore-Tested Secrets On Landing A Mint Guy, Staying Fresh To Death, and Kicking the Competition to the Curb. In 2012, she was sued for allegedly filming several episodes of her reality show without proper authorization from her landlord.[10]
