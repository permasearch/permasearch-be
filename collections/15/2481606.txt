During the reforms in the 1st century AD, the command structure and make-up of the legions was formally laid down, in a form that would endure for centuries. Standard centuriae consisted of 80 men each. The first cohort was made up of five double-strength centuries totalling 800 men, the centurion of its 1st century automatically being the most senior in the legion. This century was known as the primus pilii (first files), and its centurion was known as the primus pilus (first file or first spear). The Primus Pilus could be promoted to Praefectus Castrorum, or "Camp Prefect." The Praefectus Castrorum would be in charge of the daily running of a legion.
