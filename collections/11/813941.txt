From an early age Hubbard was involved with sports. He umpired pickup baseball games at the age of 18.[7] Hubbard chose to attend a college or university that offered football, selecting Chillicothe Business College in Chillicothe, Missouri[6] while also continuing to work around his family farm.[4] A chance meeting in 1922 with Bo McMillin, the new football coach at Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana, led Hubbard to enroll and play football there from 1922 to 1924.[6] Hubbard was the school's first All-American.[8] Georgia Tech coach Bill Alexander once watched Centenary when it was in town to play Oglethorpe. "Bo, this Oglethorpe bunch has fast backs, but the line is light and green. If you turn that Hubbard loose, he might kill some of them. Have Cal 'hurt his knee', why don't you, and let him sit on the bench?"[9]
