The proposed title "You Think You've Got Tribbles...?" had to be discarded after a Shulman short story was discovered with the title "You Think You've Got Troubles?" (upon which the third-season The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episode "Dig, Dig, Dig" was based), which could possibly have presented a copyright infringement.[citation needed] The episode was then renamed "The Trouble with Tribbles".[35]
