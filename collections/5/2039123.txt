The solvents do not form a unified solution together because they are immiscible. When the funnel is allowed to sit after being shaken, the liquids form distinct physical layers, with the less dense liquid floating and more dense sinking. A mixture of solutes is thus separated into two physically separate solutions, each enriched in different solutes.
