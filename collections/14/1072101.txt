On 2 October 2016, Pope Francis spoke in favor of pastoral care for and including transgender Catholics in the church, stating priests should "accompany them spiritually" and that they should never be turned away, even if they have undergone gender transition and sex-reassignment operations.[375] He spoke out against "Gender Theory", that is the concept that gender identity is not definite and can change, being taught in schools and referred to it as "ideological colonization" and said it was one of the threats against traditional marriage and is destructive to children.[376][377]
