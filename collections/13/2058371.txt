The pair met twice during the summer clay-court season, Nadal continuing his dominance on clay. He defeated Djokovic en route to the title in the quarter-finals of the Rome Masters[11] and went on to do the same on his way to a third Grand Slam title, at the French Open a month later. Nadal defeated Djokovic, who was playing his first Grand Slam semi-final.[12] They then met for the first time on grass, in the semi-finals of Wimbledon. After having split the first two sets, Djokovic was forced to concede the match to Nadal on a retirement.[13]
