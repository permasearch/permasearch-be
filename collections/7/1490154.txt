During his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the NLRA and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).[28][29] The NLRB and NLRA were also under intense pressure from employers, the press, congressional Republicans, and conservative Democrats.[30][31]
