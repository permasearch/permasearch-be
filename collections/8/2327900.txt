After the series was greenlighted, Martin wanted to involve Dotrice, suggesting Maester Aemon, Rodrik Cassel or Grand Maester Pycelle as possible roles.[3] He was eventually cast as Pycelle,[4] but he had to withdraw from the show for medical reasons and Julian Glover was cast to replace him.[5] In the second season, with his health recovered, he was given the role of Hallyne.[6]
