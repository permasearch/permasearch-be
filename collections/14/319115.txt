The evolution of roots had consequences on a global scale. By disturbing the soil and promoting its acidification (by taking up nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate[verification needed]), they enabled it to weather more deeply, injecting carbon compounds deeper into soils[79] with huge implications for climate.[80] These effects may have been so profound they led to a mass extinction.[81]
