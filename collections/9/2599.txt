Emily Bennett was the handmaiden of Katherine Pierce in 1864 and a powerful witch. She was a direct descendant of one of the women accused of witchcraft during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Emily was an ancestor of Bonnie Bennett through Sheila Bennett. She was the one who gave Katherine, Pearl, Anna, Harper, Damon and Stefan the jewelry which enabled them to walk in the sun. Although she helped these vampires, she secretly fought against them, for she enchanted Jonathan Gilbert's inventions, including a device which could hurt vampires. When the vampires were rounded-up by the Founding Families, she and Damon made a bargain: Damon would protect Emily's descendants and Emily would use her grimoire to protect Katherine by entombing her with 26 other vampires under the old Fell's Church. Emily was later burned at the stake by the Founding Families and her possessions, including her grimoire, were taken and buried in Giuseppe Salvatore's grave. Damon rescued Emily's children when the townspeople came for her.
