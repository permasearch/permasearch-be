The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.[30] Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty citizen science observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed "STEVE" (a reference to the animated film Over the Hedge in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature "Steve"); subsequent reportage went viral, and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.[31]
