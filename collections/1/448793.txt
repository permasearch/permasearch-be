The Middle English word bugge is the basis for the terms "bugbear" and "bugaboo" as terms used for a monster.[4] Baffle Ball, the first mechanical pinball game, was advertised as being "free of bugs" in 1931.[5] Problems with military gear during World War II were referred to as bugs (or glitches).[6] In a book published in 1942, Louise Dickinson Rich, speaking of a powered ice cutting machine, said, "Ice sawing was suspended until the creator could be brought in to take the bugs out of his darling."[7]
