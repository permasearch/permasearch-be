In 1823 a St. Louis merchant named William Henry Ashley(started the rendezvous system) led a party up the Sweetwater to its source, rediscovered the pass(look back to previous paragraph), and spent the summer in its vicinity trapping. He returned again in 1824, this time going as far as Great Salt Lake and setting up a trading post there, which after three profitable years he sold to the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, headed by William Sublette, and David Jackson.[6]
