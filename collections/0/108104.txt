In July 2013, before filming began, Marshall put the cast through six weeks[34] of rehearsals on a soundstage and blocked their scenes.[2] In August, the cast members visited Angel Recording Studios to separately record their respective parts in the presence of Sondheim himself.[2] Over 90% of the vocal tracks in the final version of the film are from the recording studio sessions, while the rest were recorded on location or on the set.[2] The advantage of blocking and rehearsing all scenes first was that the cast members could then precisely calibrate their voices in the recording studio to the planned appearance of each scene when later filmed, thereby minimizing the slightly disconcerting disconnection between vocals and choreography typical of music videos.[61]
