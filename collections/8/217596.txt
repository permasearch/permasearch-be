The Flower Queen was written as "a work for teenage girls (scored for first and second soprano and alto)."[135] It was performed first on March 11, 1853 by the young ladies of Jacob Abbott's Springer Institute,[136] and almost immediately repeated by Root's students at the Rutgers Female Institute; it was praised by R. Storrs Willis.[137] It was performed an estimated 1,000 times throughout the United States in the first four years after its publication.[138] The success of The Flower Queen and subsequent cantatas brought great acclaim and fortune to Root, with little of either for Crosby.[139]
