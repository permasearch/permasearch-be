Contingency fees do not guarantee civil justice or equal access to civil courts. Attorneys who practice in the area of civil litigation typically accept cases that present both clear liability and a means of collecting a judgment or settlement, such as through a defendant's insurance coverage. Not all cases are immediately transparent. Some require extensive investigation before the chances of success can be properly assessed. Such cases might be turned away because even the initial assessment of their strength is costly and risky.
