On May 19, 2016, the Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, continuing their unbeaten streak in the 2016 playoffs and making Lue the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 postseason games.[10] Eight days later, Lue led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in his first year of coaching, becoming one of the few coaches to make it to the Finals after replacing a head coach during the regular season. On June 19, 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, with Lue becoming the second rookie coach in consecutive seasons to win it all, the third person to become champion as a mid-season replacement coach (after Paul Westhead in 1979–80, and Pat Riley in 1981–82, also his rookie coaching season), and the 14th person to win an NBA championship as a head coach and player.[11][12]
