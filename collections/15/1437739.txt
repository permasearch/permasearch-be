On July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, Dateline: Disneyland,[5] which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by Art Linkletter, who Walt Disney had worked out a deal with prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast. [6]Art Linkletter was assisted by Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan, and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various land of Disneyland.[7]
