Bach's four short masses are parodies of cantata movements; he used several movements of Siehe zu, da√ü deine Gottesfurcht nicht Heuchelei sei, BWV 179, for two of them. When he compiled his Mass in B minor, he again used many cantata movements, such as a part of Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, for the Crucifixus of the Credo.
