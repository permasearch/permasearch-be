Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Ross (David Schwimmer) arrive at the hospital, where Phoebe tells the nurse at the desk that she is in labor. In Phoebe’s hospital room, Ross and Rachel enter with bad news: her doctor fell and hit her head in the shower, meaning she's unable to make it to the birth. The replacement doctor, Dr. Harad assures Phoebe that she's in good hands, until he spontaneously declares his admiration for Fonzie, from Happy Days several times. Phoebe demands that Ross goes and find her another doctor, but when the replacement is too young for her liking, Dr. Harad returns. She moreover begs Rachel to talk to her brother Frank, and convince him to let her keep one of the triplets, after having second thoughts over the surrogate process. In the delivery room, Phoebe gives birth to a boy and two girls. Rachel breaks the news to Phoebe that she won’t be able to keep one of the babies. She asks her friends to leave, in order to have a moment alone with the triplets.
