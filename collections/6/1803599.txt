Voormann's aim was to reflect the radical departure in sound represented particularly by "Tomorrow Never Knows",[260] and his choice of a black-and-white cover was in deliberate defiance of the preference for vivid colour.[261] When he submitted his work to the Beatles, Epstein wept, overjoyed that Voormann had managed to capture the experimental tone of the Beatles' new music.[261][262] Voormann also designed a series of four images, titled "Wood Face", "Wool Face", "Triangle Face" and "Sun Face", which appeared on the front of the Northern Songs sheet music for each of the album's songs.[263][264]
