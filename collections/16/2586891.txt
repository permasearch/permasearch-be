Spontaneous erection, also known as involuntary, random or unwanted erection, is commonplace and a normal part of male physiology. Socially, such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public or when undesired.[12] Erections can occur spontaneously at any time of day, and if clothed may cause a bulge which (if required)  can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt, or baggier clothes.[14]
