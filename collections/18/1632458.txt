Some instrument amplifiers, particularly bass amplifiers, contain built-in DI units, and can be connected to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a bassist who wanted to connect their instrument through a public address system (PA system) or sound reinforcement system at a live show, while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier's preamplifier and equalizer circuitry and the custom settings. In comparison, if an external DI box is used, with the bassist plugging her/his bass into the DI box and sending the signal to their bass amp, the DI box signal would be the direct signal from the bass' pickups. With the external DI box approach, the sound shaping added to the bass' signal on the amplifier (e.g. boosting the preamplifier, adding overdrive, or adjusting the equalization to change the tone) would not be present in the external DI box signal. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier's equalizer (EQ) through a pre-eq/post-eq switch. This can be used if a "clean" direct output from the amplifier is desired, which does not contain the tone shaping created by the bassist's adjustment of the EQ controls.
