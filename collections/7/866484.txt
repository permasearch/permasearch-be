The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer     n   {\displaystyle n}   is called trial division. This method divides     n   {\displaystyle n}   by each integer from 2 up to the square root of     n   {\displaystyle n}  . Any such integer dividing     n   {\displaystyle n}   evenly establishes     n   {\displaystyle n}   as composite; otherwise it is prime. Integers larger than the square root do not need to be checked because, whenever     n = a ⋅ b   {\displaystyle n=a\cdot b}  , one of the two factors     a   {\displaystyle a}   and     b   {\displaystyle b}   is less than or equal to the square root of     n   {\displaystyle n}  . Another optimization is to check only primes as factors in this range.[117] For instance, to check whether 37 is prime, this method divides it by the primes in the range from 2 to √37, which are 2, 3, and 5. Each division produces a nonzero remainder, so 37 is indeed prime.
