Among the 608 banks that closed in November and December 1930, the Bank of United States accounted for a third of the total $550 million deposits lost and, it is thought, that with its closure, bank failures reached a critical mass.[23] People flocked to withdraw their money from other banks. In turn, the banks called in loans and sold assets in order to stay liquid. In that month alone, over 300 banks around the country failed.[24]
