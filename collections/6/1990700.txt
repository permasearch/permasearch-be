While the cash option usually is chosen, the SuperLotto Plus annuity is graduated. As of the May 11, 2013 drawing, the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30-payment graduated annuity stream, similar to that of Mega Millions, partly in response to low long-term interest rates. The cash value is now guaranteed. The graduated payments begin at 1.81% of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56% (more than triple that of the first payment) of the advertised jackpot amount.[25][26] Previously, the first payment was 2.5% of the annuity value (or share) of the jackpot, with the second installment 2.7%. The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 percentage point yearly, so that the final (26th) installment represented 5.1% of the annuity.
