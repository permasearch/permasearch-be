A white she-cat with deep blue eyes, Tinycloud is one of the three kits of Clovertail's litter, formerly a loner named Tiny. Her mentor is Sparrowpelt.  Her warrior name, Tinycloud, is revealed in SkyClan's Destiny.[60] When she is given her warrior name, she disapproves of it. She says she is no longer tiny and should be named differently. Later, she approves of it, knowing that it is part of the warrior naming ritual.
