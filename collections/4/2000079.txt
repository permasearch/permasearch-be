Due to a desire to release the album worldwide simultaneously, Simple Minds decided not to put the record out for sale before Christmas 1983,[23] instead releasing Sparkle in the Rain on 6 February 1984.[35] The first UK pressing was issued on white vinyl and the first Canadian pressing was issued on transparent vinyl; all other foreign editions were initially issued on black vinyl;[36] the album immediately entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1 to become the band's first chart-topper,[2] and it remained in the charts for 57 weeks; among the band's records, only Once Upon a Time has bettered this chart run.[37] The first Canadian pressing was issued on transparent vinyl (but using the standard green/red Virgin label instead of the custom design);[36] the album peaked at No. 14 in the Canadian RPM national album chart.[6] Sparkle in the Rain was certified gold in Canada for selling over 50,000 units in that country,[38] and topped the New Zealand Albums Chart for two weeks, further remaining in their charts for eighteen weeks.[3] Sparkle in the Rain also peaked at No. 2 in both Sweden, charting for six weeks,[5] and the Netherlands, charting for thirty weeks.[4] By 1988 Sparkle in the Rain had sold approximately one million-and-a-half copies worldwide.[39]
