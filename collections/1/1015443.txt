The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was released simultaneously with its SNES counterpart in all three regions. Although there are differences between the SNES and Genesis ports, the two versions are almost identical in terms of content. Like the SNES version, the Genesis port supported the XBAND online network (although only for its North American release). The Sega Genesis version was released on a 40 Megabit cartridge, which allowed the inclusions of additional voice clips of the game's announcer which were missing from the SNES version, such as stating the names of the fighters, although the audio quality is not of the same level as the original arcade version. In the Options menu, the player can choose to play the Super Battle mode on "Normal" or "Expert" difficulty; the latter increases the number of opponents from the arcade version's 12 to all 16 characters. This version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 8, 2011, the PAL region on April 12, 2012, and in North America on April 26, 2012.
