Tweed was convicted for stealing an amount estimated by an aldermen's  committee in 1877 at between $25 million and $45 million from New York City taxpayers through political corruption, although later estimates ranged as high as $200 million.[3]  Unable to make bail, he escaped from jail once, but was returned to custody.  He died in the Ludlow Street Jail.
