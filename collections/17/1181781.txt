Rainey was a cast member on the MTV reality TV series The Real World: San Francisco in 1994. He and his castmates moved into the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12 of that year.[7] Among the cast, Rainey was an eccentric center of attention. In the season premiere he arrived at the house last because he was detained by police for a traffic incident. He incurred many minor injuries while bike riding, and kept photos of them, which he showed to his housemates.[8] Although the producers informed the housemates that they would be living with someone who was HIV-positive, they did not reveal who it was, and as a result of these injuries, which included scabs on his face, some of the other castmates incorrectly assumed the HIV-positive cast member was Rainey.[4][9] Rainey frequently clashed with his roommates over hygiene,[8][10] being repeatedly criticized for poor hygiene.[11] His housemates also complained of his lack of consideration for others, and his need to monopolize conversation.[12][13] Rainey's Jewish housemate Judd Winick took offense to Rainey's wearing of a T-shirt that depicted four guns arranged in the shape of a swastika, and his refusal to take the shirt off, a confrontation only revealed in the MTV book The Real World Diaries and depicted in the 2009 film Pedro, not the series itself.[14]
