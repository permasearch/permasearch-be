THQ said they would bring a more realistic fighting experience with a new, but old analog control grappling system, enabling the player to throw their opponent anywhere they want with in reason, in contrast to previous preset animations.[1] In the new system, grappling moves are now affected by analog control, in contrast to the button-based system from preceding games.[2] Much like the previous game, one can also move around the ring by analog control instead of using the D-pad.[3] An option to switch to the previous control layout is also possible.[4] The chain reversal system has also been improved and now involves grapples as well as strikes.[1]
