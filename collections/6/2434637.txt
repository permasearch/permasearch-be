Although often described as extremely dangerous in the media, piranhas typically do not represent a serious risk to humans.[2][24] However, attacks have occurred, especially when the piranhas are in a stressed situation, such as the dense groups that may occur when the water is lower during the dry season and food is relatively scarce.[2][25] Swimming near fishermen may increase the risk of attacks due to the commotion caused by struggling fish and the presence of bait in the water.[26][27] Splashing attracts piranhas and for this reason children are more often attacked than adults.[25] Being in the water when already injured or otherwise incapacitated also increases the risk.[2] There are sometimes warning signs at high-risk locations,[28] and beaches in such areas are sometimes protected by a barrier.[29]
