Boccioni's work was in plaster, and was never cast into bronze in his lifetime. His plaster cast is displayed at the Museu de Arte Contemporânea in São Paulo. Two casts were made in 1931, one of which is displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.[6] Two were made in 1949, one of which is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York[2] and other one at the Museum of Twentieth Century in Milan. Two more were made in 1972, one of which is displayed at the Tate Modern in London.[9] Another eight, in 1972, were made not from the plaster, but from one of the 1949 bronzes. One bronze cast is in the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.[10] In 2014, a bronze was donated to the National Gallery of Cosenza.[11]
