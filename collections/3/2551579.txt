In "These Boots Were Made for Stalking", Jenna walks into the police station in order to come clean about her actions and interrupts a conversation between Spencer and detective Marco Furey. Marshall reports that after the events that took place at the abandoned school for blind students, she opted to keep a low profile due to fear of being harmed by Noel. According to Jenna, Noel was accountable for Sara Harvey's homicide and she feared to be his next victim. Kahn recruited Jenna with the assertion that Charlotte left enough money in her will to afford Marshall another eye surgery. Nevertheless, Jenna suspected Noel of stealthily plotting to steal the cash all to himself since his parents had financially cut him off. In an attempt to spare her life, Marshall brought a gun to the deserted sight school as an act of self-defense and pretended to hold a grudge against the Liars. After Jenna describes her side of the story, Furey orders one of his associates to escort Marshall to a conference room so she can make an official statement. As Jenna exits the room, Spencer insists to Marco that she's an unreliable narrator but Furey informs her the authorities don't have any evidence against Marshall.
