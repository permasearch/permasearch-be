The notorious captain and blackbirder Bully Hayes was shipwrecked on Kosrae on March 15, 1874, when his ship the Leonora was caught in Utwe harbor during a storm. Bully Hayes made his home in Utwe for seven months, during which he terrorized the local people.[7] In September 1874, HMS Rosario (under the command of Captain Dupuis) arrived to investigate the claims against Hayes. He was arrested, but then escaped in a 14-foot boat, built of timber from the wreck of the Leonora.[7][8] His treasure may have been left behind,[7] buried somewhere in the forest, although subsequent diggings have failed to uncover it.[9] The existence of this buried money is part of the myths that surround Hayes.[10]
