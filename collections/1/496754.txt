A related expression in Hebrew can be found in a commentary on the Biblical commandment of the septennial sabbatical year. Leviticus 25:1 specifically states that God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai; while this was a common location for God to speak to Moses, the text's explicit reference to it is very rare. Accordingly, Rashi's commentary begins with the question "What is the connection between Shmita and Mount Sinai?" (?מה עניין שמיטה אצל הר סיני)[3] The question has since taken on a general meaning equivalent to that of the "price of tea in China" expression.[citation needed]
