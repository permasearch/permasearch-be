The verse "Verily Allah intends to ... (33:33)" was revealed to Muhammad in the house of Umm Salama. Upon that, he gathered Fatimah, al-Hasan, and al-Husain, and covered them with a cloak, and he also covered Ali who was behind him. Then he said: "O' Allah! These are the Members of my House (Ahlul-Bayt). Keep them away from every impurity and purify them with a perfect purification." Umm Salama (his wife) asked: "Am I also included among them O Apostle of Allah?" Muhammad replied: "You remain in your position and you are toward a good ending."[10]
