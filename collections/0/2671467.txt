Ozone cracking is a form of stress corrosion cracking where active chemical species attack products of a susceptible material. Ozone cracking was once commonly seen in the sidewalls of tires but is now rare owing to the use of antiozonants. Other means of prevention include replacing susceptible rubbers with resistant elastomers such as polychloroprene, EPDM or Viton.
