In order for the Chromium (III) hydroxide ion to properly oxidize, it must form a surface complex with manganese oxides. Additionally, organic chelating agents that promote dissociation of minerals can, by extension, promote oxidation of Cr(OH)2+ to Cr6+ ions. The Cr6+ ion is extremely toxic and motile,[35] and causes negative effects to photosynthesis as well as general health in plants.[36] HCrO4âˆ’ proceeds to dissociate further in water under the reaction:
