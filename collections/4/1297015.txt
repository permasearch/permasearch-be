A completely functioning full-scale replica of the Hogwarts Express was created for the Diagon Alley expansion, connecting King's Cross Station at Universal Studios to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure,[48][68] manufactured by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in the form of a funicular railway people mover.[69] The Hogwarts Express King's Cross Station features a wall between Platforms 9 and 10, where guests can "walk through" to get to Platform 9Â¾, like in the first film.
