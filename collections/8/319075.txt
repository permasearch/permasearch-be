All multicellular plants have a life cycle comprising two generations or phases. The gametophyte phase has a single set of chromosomes (denoted 1n), and produces gametes (sperm and eggs). The sporophyte phase has paired chromosomes (denoted 2n), and produces spores. The gametophyte and sporophyte phases may be homomorphic, appearing identical  in some algae, such as Ulva lactuca, but are very different  in all modern land plants, a condition known as heteromorphy.
