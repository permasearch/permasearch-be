In situ (/ɪn ˈsɪtjuː/ or /ɪn ˈsaɪtʃuː/; often not italicized in English[1][2][3]) is a Latin phrase that translates literally to "on site"[4] or "in position".[5] It means "locally", "on site", "on the premises" or "in place" to describe an event where it takes place, and is used in many different contexts. For example, in fields such as physics, chemistry, or biology, in situ may describe the way a measurement is taken, that is, in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test.
