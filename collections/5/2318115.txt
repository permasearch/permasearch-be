For centuries there have been anecdotal accounts of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, it has been suggested they are responding to the P-wave.[33] These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the S-waves that cause most severe shaking.[34] They predict not the earthquake itself — that has already happened — but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.
