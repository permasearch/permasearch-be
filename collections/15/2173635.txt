The First Special Service Force is represented by several military reenactment groups which are known as The First Special Service Force Living History Group (FSSF-LHG). These groups are made up of men from Canada, United States, Italy, France, Russia, and Great Britain. As of January 2010 there are approximately 1000 World War II reenactors portraying the FSSF. Members of the FSSF-LHG Ontario section (John Dallimore and Kyle McNally) and the Scottish section (Paul Dray) ventured to Monte La Difensa in 2005 where they placed a memorial plaque dedicated to the men of the force. Members of the FSSF-LHG also attend the veterans reunions annually where they participate in functions with the veterans and their families.
