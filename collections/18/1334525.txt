The song has received critical acclaim. Brennan Carley of Spin wrote, "It's as if No Doubt met the C+C Music Factory".[14] Consequence of Sound's Michelle Geslani called the song a 'bouncy banger' and complimented MØ's "siren-like" vocals.[15] David Jeffries from AllMusic praised MØ and DJ Snake for helping the track "deliver the sentimental lyrics and sensual house music at an intoxicating half-speed tempo."[16] Billboard's Matt Medved called the song and the recent Diplo's collaboration with Skrillex on Jack Ü's "Where Are Ü Now" "both innovates and finds crossover appeal", with the first being called "a pop gloss."[17]
