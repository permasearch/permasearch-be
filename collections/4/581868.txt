The Texas "escape route" conceived by Walker promised to increase demand for slaves in fertile cotton-growing regions of Texas, as well as the monetary value of slaves. Cash-poor plantation owners in the older eastern South were promised a market for surplus slaves at a profit.[94] Texas annexation, wrote Walker, would eliminate all these dangers and "fortify the whole Union."[95]
