Hathor was also associated with the afterlife. Due to her maternal nature, she was believed to greet the souls of the dead, sometimes offering refreshments to help them reach the afterlife, and many would pray to her for prosperity once passing on. Depictions of Hathor guiding rulers into the afterlife exist, but some scholars believe that lower-class Egyptians would also seek her favor, suggesting she would help any who were worthy. [24]
