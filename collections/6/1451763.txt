Cremation of Fields' remains, as directed in his will, was delayed pending resolution of an objection filed by Hattie and Claude Fields on religious grounds.[82] They also contested a clause leaving a portion of his estate to establish a "W. C. Fields College for Orphan White Boys and Girls, where no religion of any sort is to be preached".[84][85] After a lengthy period of litigation his remains were cremated on June 2, 1949,[86] and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.
