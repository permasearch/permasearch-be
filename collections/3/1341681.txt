A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.[152] Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s[153][154][155] and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts.[156] In 1968, in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.[157][158]
