With 8:50 left in the game, Vick completed five of eight passes for 68 yards on a 75-yard touchdown drive, scoring on a fourth down 1-yard run. On a two-point conversion attempt, Vick completed a pass to tight end Brent Celek, but it was negated by a penalty against him for putting a foot out of bounds before he came back to catch the ball and their second attempt was incomplete, keeping the score at 21â€“16. Philadelphia had to use up all their timeouts on the Packers ensuring drive, but got the ball back with 1:45 left in the game. Receptions by DeSean Jackson and Riley Cooper for gains of 28 and 11 yards moved the ball to the Green Bay 24-yard line. But with 33 seconds left, Williams intercepted a pass intended for Cooper in the end zone to put the game away.
