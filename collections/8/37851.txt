Byron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see[7] because at Gammie's last meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes the ladies needed to warn him since he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's. Byron is Arthur Heffley's son.
