A collection of original Zorro short stories, some inspired specifically by Guy Williams, was edited by Richard Dean Starr and released in 2008. It includes an introduction by Guy Williams Jr. (with Matthew Baugh) and an afterword by Isabel Allende.[14] The cover art on the trade paperback edition by Douglas Klauba was an homage to Guy Williams.
