At a certain point while gently lifting the clutch, the car will begin to move as the clutch starts to slip, referred to as the biting point.[1] Here, the accelerator pedal should be gently depressed to slowly increase the car's speed. Once the car reaches a suitable speed, the clutch can be fully engaged and speed can then be controlled either by varying the engine speed or by partially disengaging the clutch again if necessary.
