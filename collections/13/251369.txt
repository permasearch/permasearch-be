Under President Dwight Eisenhower, a rollback strategy was considered against communism in Eastern Europe from 1953 to 1956. Eisenhower agreed to a propaganda campaign to rollback the influence of communism psychologically, but he refused to intervene in the 1956 Hungarian Uprising,[33] mainly for fear that it would cause the Third World War. Since 1950, the Soviets had been known to possess nuclear weapons.[34]
