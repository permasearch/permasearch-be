Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the President of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court. Nominations the Supreme Court of the United States are considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. Since 1789, there have been 163 formal nominations of 144 persons to the Supreme Court. Through August 2018, 125 nominations have been successful; there is also one nomination pending before the Senate. Of the 37 that were unsuccessful, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court.[3] Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.
