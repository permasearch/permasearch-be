The 2024 Summer Olympic programme is scheduled to feature 28 sports encompassing 306 events, though this is likely to change depending on success of the five additional sports added to the Tokyo Olympics. This means there could be up to 33 sports, and any new sports which are added to the Olympic programme. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.
