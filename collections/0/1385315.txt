The "rally" mechanic is associated with ally creatures from Zendikar. It was first introduced in the Battle for Zendikar set, although it is essentially a keyword given to the abilities of allies from the original Zendikar set. A creature with a rally ability triggers whenever an ally enters the battlefield under their control and gives some kind of bonus to all of that player's creatures, even non-ally creatures.
