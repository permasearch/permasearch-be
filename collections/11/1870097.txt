Today, however, the word "Pashmina" is used indiscriminately, and many scarves made from natural or synthetic fiber are sold under the name "Pashmina", creating confusion in the market.[citation needed]. The exorbitant price of a real pashmina shawl is due to the amount of expert craftsmanship that goes into creating each shawl and the rarity of the pashmina wool â€“ the wool is used in an authentic Kashmiri pashmina comes from the Changthangi breed of the Capra hircus goat and this breed constitutes less than 0.1% of global cashmere production.
