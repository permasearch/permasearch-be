The Litany of Saints is used prominently at the Easter Vigil, the Mass celebrated on the night before Easter Day. At this Mass, adults who have chosen to become Catholic receive the Sacraments of Initiation in the form of Baptism, or simple Reception, with Confirmation and Holy Communion. Following the readings from Scripture and just before the actual rite of baptism or confirmation, the Litany of Saints is sung. Even if there is no-one to be baptized, the Litany may be sung for the blessing of holy water in the font. But if the font is not blessed (i.e. holy water is blessed in a simple container on the sanctuary), the Litany is not used.
