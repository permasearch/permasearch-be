No federal Australian legislation guarantees freedom of movement within the Commonwealth of Australia.  Various Australian laws restrict the right on various grounds.[74] Until 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island had immigration controls separate from those of the remainder of Australia and a permit was required for Australian citizens or residents to enter. In August 2014 the Australian Commonwealth Government proposed regulating the rights of Australian citizens to travel to and from designated areas associated with terrorism.[75]
