More than 20 years later, the Mighty Ducks has become a cult classic for those who grew up in the 1990s. Houston Texans star J.J. Watt [10] and Washington Nationals star Bryce Harper[11] are among the trilogy's fans. A podcast dedicated to the trilogy, The Quack Attack, has more than 100 episodes.[12]
