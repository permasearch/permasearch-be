There is a Jewish tradition that in addition to the three biblical couples mentioned above, Adam and Eve were buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs (Zohar, Ruth 96).  This tradition is supported by the simple wording of Genesis 23:2, which refers to "Kiryat Arba... Hevron" ("arba" means four). Commenting on that passage, Rashi listed the four couples chronologically, starting with Adam and Eve.
