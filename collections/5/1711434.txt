Uruguay is part of the One Laptop per Child project, and in 2009 became the first country in the world to provide a laptop for every primary school student,[113] as part of the Plan Ceibal.[114] Over the 2007â€“2009 period, 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers were involved in the scheme; around 70% of the laptops were given to children who did not have computers at home.[114] The OLPC programme represents less than 5% of the country's education budget.[114]
