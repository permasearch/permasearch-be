Ground sloths lived in South America and, after the Great American Interchange, North America. They disappeared shortly after the appearance of humans about 10,000 years ago. Evidence suggests human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna. Ground sloth emains found in both North and South America indicate that they were killed, cooked, and eaten by humans.[4] Climate change that came with the end of the last ice age may have also played a role. Megalocnus survived on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago, long after other ground sloths died out on the mainland, but then went extinct when human finally arrived there too.[15]
