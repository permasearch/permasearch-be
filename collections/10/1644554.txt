While McKee was the biggest solo winner until 1999, nine couples on The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime won the show's top prize of $1,000,000 (equivalent to $2,108,000 in 2016),[1] in a combination of prizes and a long-term annuity, during the show's run in syndication from January 1986 to September 1987.[11] However, this program had no solo players.
