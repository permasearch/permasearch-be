W & R Jacob and Company started producing the ‘’Club Milk’’ biscuit in Dublin just before the outbreak of World War I.[1] It became a popular brand across Ireland. The confection consisted of two rectangular Marie biscuits forming a filled sandwich using a cocoa cream, then covered in thick milk chocolate. Each bar was wrapped in foil, and then further wrapped in a paper outer wrapping.
