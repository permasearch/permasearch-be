The Anglo-Khasi War was part of the independence struggle between the Khasi people and the British Empire between the years 1829-1833.[1] The war started with Tirot Sing's attack on a British garrison that disobeyed orders of this Khasi king to stop a road construction project through the Khasi Hills. The Khasis were defeated in this war and the British gained supremacy over these hills.[2]
