After explaining to the guys the various virtues of getting the role in the next 'Jeremy Beck' (Scott Foley) movie, Karen, Dana, and Al audition for the part. Karen and Dana are not quite what the producer (Ray Abruzzo) wants, but Al is just what they are looking for. Al also has great acting talent, and does such a fantastic job that they re-write the script to include her in another scene. Al loves it, and decides she wants to quit school and move to Hollywood. She and Frank agree that she can join the drama club and, if necessary, move to Hollywood after she finishes school.
