In an interview with The Independent, Russell T Davies said the episode is "practically a love story for the Doctor ... It's very understated, very beautifully done, but it's nonetheless a Time Lord falling in love and Rose's reaction to him falling in love with someone else."[4] Moffat was inspired by Audrey Niffenegger's novel The Time-Traveler's Wife, though the episode's structure is different from that of the novel.[5] During the production, Moffat considered "Madame de Pompadour", "Every Tick of My Heart", "Reinette and the Lonely Angel" and "Loose Connection" for the episode's title.[2] "The Girl in the Fireplace" was planned as the second episode of the 2006 series, however when Davies realised how experimental it had become in Moffat's hands, he decided to move it to fourth in the running order between "School Reunion" and "Rise Of The Cybermen".[2]
