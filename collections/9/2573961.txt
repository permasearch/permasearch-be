In the 1670s the Ashanti went from being a tributary state to a centralized hierarchical kingdom. Ashanti king Asantehene Osei Tutu I, military leader and head of the Oyoko clan, founded the Ashanti kingdom.[6][8] Osei Tutu obtained the support of other clan chiefs and using Kumasi as the central base, subdued surrounding states.[8] Osei Tutu I challenged and eventually defeated Denkyira in 1701,[6][8] and from this, the name Asante came to be.[6][8]
