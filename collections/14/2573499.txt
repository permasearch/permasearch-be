The Team of the Year Award was first presented in 1960, six years after the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team.[5] The England national rugby union team and the Ryder Cup team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award on one of those occasions.[6] Liverpool F.C. have won the award three times.[7] The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4 x 400 m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969,[8] and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4 x 400 m relay team in 1991.[9] Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
