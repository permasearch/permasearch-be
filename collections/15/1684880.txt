The lyric, written by Cats director Trevor Nunn, was loosely based on[citation needed] T. S. Eliot's poems "Preludes"[3] and "Rhapsody on a Windy Night".[4]" Andrew Lloyd Webber's former writing partner Tim Rice and contemporary collaborator Don Black submitted a lyric to the show's producers for consideration, although Nunn's version was favoured. Elaine Paige has said that she sang a different lyric to the tune of "Memory" for the first ten previews of Cats.
