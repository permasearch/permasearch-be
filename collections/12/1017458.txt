The first computers to implement architectures enabling reverse Polish notation were the English Electric Company's KDF9 machine, which was announced in 1960 and delivered (i.e. made available commercially) in 1963, and the American Burroughs B5000, announced in 1961 and also delivered in 1963. One of the designers of the B5000, Robert S. Barton, later wrote that he developed reverse Polish notation independently of Hamblin sometime in 1958 after reading a 1954 textbook on symbolic logic by Irving Copi,[13][14][15] where he found a reference to Polish notation,[15] which made him read the works of Jan ≈Åukasiewicz as well,[15] and before he was aware of Hamblin's work. Designed by Robert "Bob" Appleby Ragen,[16] Friden introduced reverse Polish notation to the desktop calculator market with the EC-130 supporting a four-level stack[3] in June 1963.[17] The successor EC-132 added a square root function in April 1965.[18] Around 1966, the Monroe Epic calculator supported an unnamed input scheme resembling RPN as well.[3]
