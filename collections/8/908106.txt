Initial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, intended to control sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way.[105][106] However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at Miami International Airport in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida.[106][107] Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the Keys to north of Tampa, and they are gradually extending further northward.[108] In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to native species [109] and pets;[110] so much so, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recommends residents to kill them.[111]
