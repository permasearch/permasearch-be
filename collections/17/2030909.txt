Among other topics, including the dignity of labor,[20] Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity.[21] According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals.[22] "The dignity of man," he said, "is the dignity of the human being as a personâ€”a dignity that is not possessed by things."[23] To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.[24][25]
