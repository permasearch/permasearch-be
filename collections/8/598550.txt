"When Love Is Gone" was a song performed by the character Belle (portrayed by Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooge's love for money has replaced his love for her. The song itself was cut from the original 1992 theatrical edition by Jeffrey Katzenberg of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the following scene would not appeal to young children. Instead, the song was played during the end credits scene.[27] Henson objected to this decision. The concluding song, "The Love We Found", is a direct counterpoint to it.[11]
