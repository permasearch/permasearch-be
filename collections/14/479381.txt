Angora goats produce long, curling, lustrous locks of mohair. Their entire body  is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow to 9Â cm or more in length.  Angora crossbreeds, such as the pygora and the nigora, have been selected to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal.
