The trowel or spade bayonet was another multipurpose design, intended for use both as an offensive weapon as well as a digging tool for excavating entrenchments.[11][12] From 1870, the US Army issued trowel bayonets to infantry regiments based on a design by Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Rice, a US Army officer and Civil War veteran, which were manufactured by the Springfield Armory.[13] Besides its utility as both a fixed bayonet and a digging implement, the Rice trowel bayonet could be used to plaster log huts and stone chimneys for winter quarters; sharpened on one edge, it could cut tent poles and pins.[13] Ten thousand were eventually issued, and the design saw service during the 1877 Nez Perce campaign.[14] Rice was given leave in 1877 to demonstrate his trowel bayonet to several nations in Europe.[14] One infantry officer recommended it to the exclusion of all other designs, noting that "the intrenching  [sic] tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed."[13] The Rice trowel bayonet was declared obsolete by the US Army in December 1881.[14]
