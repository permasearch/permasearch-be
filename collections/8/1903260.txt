The youth population in 2010 was 34.5 percent higher than it was in 1980. However, birthrates among Brazilians are dropping and youth as a percent of total population is decreasing. The fast fertility decline since the 1960s is the largest contributing factor to Brazil's slowing population growth rate, aging population, and fast-paced demographic transition.[3] By 2050 the number of youth is projected to fall again by 33.1 percent in comparison to the 2010 youth population.[4]
