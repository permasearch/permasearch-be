O'Neal spent over a year making Barry Lyndon (1975) for Kubrick. The resulting film was considered a commercial disappointment and had a mixed critical reception; it won O'Neal a Harvard Lampoon Award for the Worst Actor of 1975. Its reputation has risen in recent years but O'Neal says his career never recovered from the film's reception.[13] "Oh it's all right but he [Kubrick] completely changed the picture during the year he spent editing it," said O'Neal.[8]
