The undivided conference named "Church of God (Seventh Day)" remained until 1933. According to Church of God historian A.N. Dugger, this is how the division occurred: Church of God members across the United States simultaneously felt the need for a "Bible Organization" of the Church of God. The idea was also to move the world headquarters to Jerusalem. The time and place chosen to perform this work of "reorganization" was Salem, West Virginia, on November 4, 1933. More and more had been exerted by about half of the membership for more unity, when some on the other hand felt that they were denied freedom of expression. On the one side, Dugger and others held to "reorganization" of church government, clean meats, no tobacco, and Passover on Nisan 14. On the other hand, Burt F. Marrs led a group of "independents" who were pro-pork and tobacco, and felt Passover should be on Nisan 15. On November 4, 1933, in Salem, the Salem Conference headquarters were started. On November 6, the Bible Advocate was printed at Salem, with the continuing volume number as the one still being published in Stanberry. Shortly thereafter, the number sequence was changed due to copyright laws. From 1933 to 1949 there were two separate Church of God organizations, one at Stanberry, Missouri, and the other at Salem, West Virginia.
