In 2005, the borough had a population of 404,458, 4.6% of the total population of the Federal District. The growth rate is 1.8% for the past decade, lower than the decade previous.[7] However, a large percentage of the boroughâ€™s population lives in poverty and many live illegally on ecological reserves, lacking basic services such as running water and drainage.[11] In the past, houses in the area were constructed from adobe and wood from juniper trees,[9] but today, most constructions are boxy cinderblock constructions, many of which are not painted.[11] By the 2010 census its population had grown to 415,007 inhabitants, or 4.69% of Mexico City's total.[12]
