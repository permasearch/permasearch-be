Serbia have won their opening game at a World Cup tournament for the first time since 1998, when they did so as Yugoslavia against Iran (1–0). Costa Rica suffered their first defeat at the World Cup since 2006 (1–2 v Poland), ending a run of five games unbeaten in the competition (W2 D3). Kolarov's strike was the first direct free-kick scored by a Serbia/Yugoslavia player at a World Cup tournament since 1998, when Siniša Mihajlović netted against Iran. Kolarov's goal for Serbia was the third direct free-kick scored at this year's World Cup (after Russia's Aleksandr Golovin and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo), which is already as many as there were in the entire 2014 tournament in Brazil.[5][6]
