Other Arabian Nights tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.[19] "The City of Brass" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition[20] across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn,[21] and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants,[22] lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings,[23] and a brass robot horseman who directs the party towards the ancient city.
