A 2013 study by Jeremy Fiel found that, “for the most part, compositional changes are to blame for the declining presence of whites in minorities’ schools,” and that racial balance increased from 1993 to 2010.[11] The study found that minority students became more isolated and less exposed to whites, but that all students became more evenly distributed across schools.
