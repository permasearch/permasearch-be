In 1913, the Southern Pacific Railroad built a line three miles to the southeast of the original location of Dime Box. Most of the residents and businesses moved to a site near the tracks. From that point onward, the original settlement became known as Old Dime Box and the new community was referred to as Dime Box.[citation needed]
