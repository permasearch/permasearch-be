Johnson began racing full-time in the Winston Cup Series during the 2002 season. He earned his first career pole position for the Daytona 500, becoming the second rookie to do so (the first was Loy Allen Jr. in 1994). In his 13th career start, Johnson scored his first career win in the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at Auto Club Speedway. Johnson became the first rookie driver to lead the point standings and to win twice at the same track during a season, by sweeping both races at Dover. He recorded four pole positions and three wins (tying the rookie record set by Tony Stewart in 1999),[13] as well as six top fives and twenty-one top ten finishes. He finished fifth in the final point standings.[9][11]
