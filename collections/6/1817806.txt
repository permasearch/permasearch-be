The area has an arid climate because it is located in the Chihuahuan desert. Seasons are less well defined than many areas in the United States.  The area experiences hot summers, cool winters and a mild spring and fall. In Juárez the average high is 31 °C (88 °F) with lows of 17 °C (63 °F). The winter high is 14 °C (57 °F) with lows of 1 °C (34 °F).[19] Because of the high altitude the region is cooler than many desert areas in Mexico and the American Southwest. Rainfall is very scarce but it is more prominent in the summer months. Snowfall is not a rare event—it normally snows once or twice every winter.
