The Ten percent law of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next was introduced by Raymond Lindeman (1942).[5] According to this law, during the transfer of energy from organic food from one trophic level to the next, only about ten percent of the energy from organic matter is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.
