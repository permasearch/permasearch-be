Union did not always come peacefully for the countries involved. It happened first in the 16th century between England and Wales, during the Welsh-descended Tudor dynasty. In the 18th century, a century after a Tudor-connected Scottish Stuart King also became King of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed. Political union happened with Ireland in 1801, several centuries after it was conquered by England: this led to the United Kingdom comprising Great Britain and the island of Ireland. The current United Kingdom comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland, after Ireland achieved independence.
