The program's official website has been given a rating of 5/5 stars at website Common Sense Media, and has been advised for viewers 5 and up. The site described the show as being "one of the Internet's best offerings for kids". It also advised that "there are links to PBS sponsors ... but other than that, there is no commercial marketing to kids." The review added, "The games are actually teaching your kids something ... [for example] The Music Box ... combines music and learning, so much so that kids won't even realize that they're figuring out space relations, handâ€“eye coordination, and mousing skills as they jam along to upbeat tunes."[17]
