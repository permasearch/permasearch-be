Played by Shivshakti Sachdev. Rani Uberoi is the only daughter of the owner of the Raj Mahal Hotel where the twins live. Rani is a rich teenager with her own private suite at the hotel, complete with a large wardrobe with several divisions and a kitchen. Rani owns a Pomeranian which she calls "princess". When she is happy, she usually claps and jumps and says "Yay Rani". Rani loves fashion; she only wears designer clothes and hates people who dislike fashion. She does not have her father or any other person to live with her to help her; instead she relies on the Raj Mahal Hotel staff for any assistance or guidance. She often lies or exaggerates: In the first episode, she tells her friends about the great wedding she is going to attend, but the staff of the Raj Mahal Hotel find out she's lying when she cheats to enter the party. She sometimes also refers to Vinnie as poor. She is the equivalent of London Tipton in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.
