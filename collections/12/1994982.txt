The fact that Ezra–Nehemiah was translated into Greek by the mid-2nd century BC suggests that this was the time by which it had come to be regarded as scripture.[2] It was treated as a single book in the Hebrew, Greek and Old Latin manuscripts. Origen's proposal that it be separated into two books was rejected by Jerome in his Latin Vulgate translation, but later medieval manuscripts of the Vulgate, especially the Paris Bibles of the 13th century onwards, increasingly split them, so that the two-books tradition became fixed in the Western church. Jewish bibles continued to treat as a single work, with the title "Ezra," until the 15th century AD,[2] but modern Hebrew bibles still print the Masoretic notes at the end of Nehemiah listing the middle verse as Nehemiah 3:32, indicating that a complete work of Ezra–Nehemiah is in view.[23] (To confuse the matter further there are several quite distinct works called Esdras, largely dealing with visions and prophecies.)
