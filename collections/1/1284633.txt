While the number of teams varied between editions, the format remained the same with a group stage and a knockout stage. If a match ends in a tie, a Super Over will be played to determine the winner. The group stage has the teams divided into two equal groups, with each playing a single round-robin tournament. The top two teams of each group advances to the advance to the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of two semi-finals, a third-place playoff and the grand final. The semi-finals has the top team of one group facing the second from the other. The winners of the semi-finals play the grand final to determine the winner of the competition, while the losers of the semi-finals play the third-place playoff.
