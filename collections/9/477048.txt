A starting pistol or starter pistol is a blank handgun[1] that is fired to start track and field races, as well as competitive swimming races at some meets. The sound and smoke of the gun going off serves as the signal for the athletes to begin the event. Starter guns "cannot fire real ammunition or be modified to fire real ammunition."[2] Beside sporting events, they are also used in films and in TV or stage shows.[1] Blank shells or caps are used to prevent expelling projectiles,[1] and only small amount of smoke can be seen when shot. Starting pistols may also include modified versions of standard pistols incapable of firing bullets, most commonly achieved by welding an obstruction into the barrel. This is less common nowadays, especially in Western countries. When electronic timing is used, a sensor is often affixed to the gun, which sends an electronic signal to the timing system upon firing. For deaf competitors or for modern electronic systems, a light may be used instead.
