After nearly two weeks of inactivity, an area of disturbed weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two on the evening of June 28, and, two hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, at which point the system was named Bret. This was the first time that two tropical storms had formed in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851.[3]
