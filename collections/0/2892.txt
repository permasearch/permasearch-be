A monocot related to lilies and grasses, yams are a vigorous herbaceous vine, providing an edible tuber.[1] Yams are also an invasive plant, often considered a "noxious weed", outside cultivated areas.[1] Native to Africa and Asia, yam tubers vary in size from that of a small potato to over 60 kg (130 lb). Some 870 species of yams are known,[1] and 95% of these crops are grown in Africa.[9]
