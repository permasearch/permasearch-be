Debnam-Carey was surprised by the attention.[6] She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau "Clexa".[19] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," said Debnam-Carey. She called this "an honor" and "flattering," and added, "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it."[6] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, "Not that much, no, that's amazing."[34] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.[35]
