The Mint's original schedule called for the designers of the three new coins to complete their models by April 15, 1916.  This would allow production of the new pieces to begin about July 1.  However, the Mint quickly revised the submission deadline to May 1; this proved optimistic as MacNeil did not submit his models, in the form of bronze casts, until May 18.  Even so, he was faster than Weinman, who did not ship the last of his casts to the Mint until June 6.[31]  Woolley formally approved the designs for the quarter by letter dated May 23, 1916.[32]  Despite the delays, the Mint attempted to meet the July 1 start date.[31]
