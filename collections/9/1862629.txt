FERC has been subject to criticism and increasing acts of activism by people from communities affected by Commission decisions approving pipeline and related projects.[8] They contend that FERC “blithely greenlights too many pipelines, export terminals and other gas infrastructure”[9] and that FERC’s structure in which it recovers its annual operating costs directly from the entities it regulates creates bias in favor of the issuance of pipeline certificates.[10] Some of these critics have disrupted several regular open meetings of the Commission,[11] and they staged two, week-long blockades of the Commission’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., to make their points.[12] "Pipelines are facing unprecedented opposition," Commissioner LaFleur remarked to the National Press Club in a 2015 speech. "We have a situation here.”[13]
