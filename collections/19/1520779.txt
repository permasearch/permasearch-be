The adidas Golden Boot is given to the top goalscorer at the FIFA World Cup. If two or more players are tied on goals, the ranking is decided by the number of assists. If still tied, the players who played the least minutes are ranked first. The players who finish second and third are given the Silver Boot and Bronze Boot respectively.[5]
