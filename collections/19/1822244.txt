The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of northern and western Europe. Many modern European states owe their origins to events unfolding in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are, in many regards, the result of military and dynastic events during this tumultuous period.[citation needed] The Middle Ages lasted until the beginning of the Early modern period in the 16th century,[13] marked by the rise of nation states,[96] the division of Western Christianity in the Reformation,[97] the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance,[98] and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the Columbian Exchange.
