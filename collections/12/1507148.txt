However, the news of their marriage made Vanessa furious, and she tried to shoot Lorie but hit Lance instead. Later, Lorie found Lance’s brother Lucas and returned him to Genoa City. Vanessa was grateful to Lorie and the pair began to get along, until Lorie accused Vanessa of faking her injuries to hold onto Lance. Furious with Lorie, Vanessa found a copy of Lorie’s unpublished book and paid someone to publish and distribute it. The book caused a scandal and Leslie refused to perform in public again. Lance rushed to comfort Leslie and they made love, and Leslie became pregnant with his child. When Lucas found out he married Leslie and the pair moved to Europe so as not to raise suspicion. When Leslie returned to Genoa City for family reasons, Vanessa took the opportunity to make sure Lorie saw her sister naked in the shower, Lorie soon realized Leslie was too far along to be pregnant by Lucas and she confronted her sister who admitted the truth. Leslie rushed back to Europe with Lucas and had her son, Brooks Prentiss. Shortly after, Leslie's marriage to Lucas fell apart and she moved in with Lance and Lorie. Lorie was extremely unhappy with her sister living in her home and after a confrontation Leslie tried to kill herself. The stress caused another breakdown and she went missing. Meanwhile, Vanessa stripped Lance of all duties at Prentiss Industries and put Lucas in charge in the hopes of once again destroying Lance and Lorie's marriage.
