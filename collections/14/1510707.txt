Suggestions for such a structure go back to Michel Verne, son of Jules Verne, who wrote about it in 1888 in a story entitled Un Express de l'avenir (An Express of the Future). This story was published in English in Strand Magazine in 1895, where it was incorrectly attributed to Jules Verne,[3] a mistake frequently repeated today.[4] 1913 saw the publication of the novel Der Tunnel by German author Bernhard Kellermann. It inspired four films of the same name: one in 1915 by William Wauer, and separate German, French, and British versions released in 1933 and 1935. The German and French versions were directed by Curtis Bernhardt, and the British one was written in part by science fiction writer Curt Siodmak. Perhaps suggesting contemporary interest in the topic, an original poster for the American release of the British version (renamed Transatlantic Tunnel) was, in 2006, estimated for auction at $2,000â€“3,000.[5]
