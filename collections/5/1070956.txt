Davis saw the full 18-piece Thornhill orchestra as cumbersome and thus decided to split the group in half for his desired sound.[30] As arrangers, both Evans and Mulligan gave Thornhill credit for crafting their sound.[9][24] Thornhill's band gave Evans the opportunity to try his hand at arranging small-group bebop tunes for big band, a practice few others were participating in. Mulligan recalls Thornhill teaching him "the greatest lesson in dynamics, the art of underblowing." [24] Thornhill has also been credited with launching the move away from call and response between sections and the move towards unison harmonies.[31]
