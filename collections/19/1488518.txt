The origin of cranial modification for the Maya is unknown, however it was possibly inherited from the Olmecs, predecessors of the Maya, located near the Tuxtla Mountains. Cranial modification was one of the Olmecs most important practices.[4] Individuals enduring cranial modification could be of any status, but many more elite individuals were depicted with cranial modifications. Intentional deformation practices were used as a way to differentiate between members of the society.[5] All members of an elite family were expected to go through cranial modification shortly after birth.[4] The procedure occurred while the skull of the child was not fully grown and had some plasticity making it easily malleable.
