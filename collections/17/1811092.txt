The park is not accessible by roads. Access is solely by air taxi or by boat along the Cook Inlet coast and Lake Clark.[6] Since much of the movement in the area is by air, the mountains present a significant barrier to air traffic. Lake Clark Pass, at 1,050 feet (320Â m) provides a way through the mountains by air at low elevation, and is the main route between Anchorage and western Alaska.[7]
