Damage in Pennsylvania largely occurred along the Monongahela River basin.[1] In Brownsville, 35 businesses were flooded, while in Greensboro, high waters damaged roads and forced 300 people to evacuate. During the floods, 23 barges broke free and became lodged in the Maxwell Lock & Dam, which is an important shipping link; the lock remained closed for nearly six weeks, costing the local economy $20 million in lost production. The same river crested at 44 ft (13 m) in Charleroi, breaking the record set in 1967. The flooded river caused $1 million in damage at California University of Pennsylvania, broke 40 barges from their moorings, and forced about 2,600 people to evacuate; one person in North Charleroi drowned after returning to his evacuated home. Throughout the region, the floods damaged or destroyed 3,349 houses,[7] leaving at least 2,000 people homeless,[29] and statewide damage was estimated at $83 million.[1]
