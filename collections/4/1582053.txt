The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency identified that the mountainous parts of Northern Luzon, Eastern Visayas and Mindanao are viable for marijuana cultivation. Marijuana produced in the country is distributed locally and is also exported to other countries. Local distribution of marijuana increased in 2012 despite destruction of illegal marijuana plantations.[4]
