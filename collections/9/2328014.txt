Falco (ファルコ, Faruko, voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka) is the successor of Gento Kōken. Falco once confronted Raoh in the past when his army came to invade the Celestial Lord's village, but the two came to a truce when Falco amputated his right leg (later replaced by a prosthetic) as a peace offering. Falco is later blackmailed by Jacó to do his evil bidding when he locks away Lui, the current Celestial Lord, and is forced to fight against Kenshiro. After Lui is rescued by Bat and Ein, Falco turns against Jacó and kills him. He later sails to the Land of Shura to rescue Lin, only to be attacked by the Nameless Shura. Although he is gravely wounded, he and Kenshiro succeed in defeating the Nameless Shura, with Falco dying of his wounds soon afterwards.
