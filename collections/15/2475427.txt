Saving throws are represented as a numeric value that often changes as the character advances in experience. In order to successfully make a throw, the character must roll dice (often a single 20-sided die ("d20") or three six-sided dice ("3d6")), achieving a result based on the calculated value of the saving throw which is compared against a success value. Under different RPG systems, the roll and/or the success value may have modifiers added or subtracted to determine the outcome.
