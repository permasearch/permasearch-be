The primary molars present also functions as a space maintainer, prevent alveolar bone resorption and delays future prosthodontic space replacement by acting as a semi permanent solution going into adulthood[81] Previous studies also shown a good prognosis of retained primary molars going into adulthood.[84][85] However, leaving the primary teeth in place may run the risk of tooth infraocclusion i.e. submerging or progressive root resorption.[80][81]
