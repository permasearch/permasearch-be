Ali Gauhar (25 June 1728 â€“ 19 November 1806), historically known as Shah Alam II, was the sixteenth Mughal Emperor. He was the son of Alamgir II. Shah Alam II became the emperor of a crumbling Mughal empire, his power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam, meaning, 'The kingdom of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi.[1][2]
