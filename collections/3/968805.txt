The dwellings contain a number of stone-built pieces of furniture, including cupboards, dressers, seats, and storage boxes. Each dwelling was entered through a low doorway that had a stone slab door that could be closed "by a bar that slid in bar-holes cut in the stone door jambs".[9] A sophisticated drainage system was incorporated into the village's design. It included a primitive form of toilet in each dwelling.[10]
