Originally, a version of Windows codenamed "Blackcomb" was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed "Longhorn," was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb.[9] By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three major viruses - the Blaster, Nachi, and Sobig worms - exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in August 2003,[10] Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also restarted, and thus delayed, in August 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn.[11] Blackcomb was renamed Vienna in early 2006.[12]
