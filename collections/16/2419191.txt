Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum.[3] The name 'leek' developed from the Old English word leac.[4] Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A.Â ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food.
