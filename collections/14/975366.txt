The water park was located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Sahara and El Rancho hotel-casinos. Wet 'n Wild opened on May 18, 1985, after $14 million was spent on construction. The park included three turbine engines capable of creating rolling four-foot waves in a 170-foot pool. The park also featured a 17,000-square-foot surf lagoon containing 500,000 gallons of water, ranging in depth from eight feet to two inches. The surf lagoon was a main attraction, as well as a 76-foot-high water slide known as the Der Stuka,[4] located along Las Vegas Boulevard on the property's west end, south of the Sahara.[5] Approximately 500,000 people were expected to visit the water park during its first year.[3][4] By June 1986, park attendance had increased 19.7 percent from the previous year.[6] A capsule known as the Bomb Bay was eventually added atop the Der Stuka. The Bomb Bay required people to push a button, which opened the floor beneath them, plummeting riders to the slide approximately 20 feet below.[5]
