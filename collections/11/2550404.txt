French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Majorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Majorca as the setting for their works: While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro.[27] Many of the works of Baltasar Porcel take place in Majorca. Ira Levin set part of his dystopian novel This Perfect Day in Majorca, making the island a centre of resistance in a world otherwise dominated by a computer.
