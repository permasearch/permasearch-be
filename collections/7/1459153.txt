In 1992, the Nissan Los Angeles Open at Riviera CC was the site of Tiger Woods' first PGA Tour event as an amateur player, as a 16-year-old high school sophomore.[8] Neither Woods nor Jack Nicklaus have won the event; Woods lost in a playoff in 1998 (at Valencia)[9] and was again a runner-up the next year at Riviera,[10] while Nicklaus' best finish was two strokes back in solo second in 1978.[11] He had earned his first paycheck as a pro in the event in 1962 at Rancho Park, less than thirty four dollars.[12]
