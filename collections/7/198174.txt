In virtually every debate on the various Factories Bills, opponents had thought it a nonsense to pass legislation for textile mills when the life of a mill child was much preferable to that of many other children: other industries were more tiring, more dangerous, more unhealthy, required longer working hours, involved more unpleasant working conditions, or (this being Victorian Britain) were more conducive to lax morals.  This logic began to be applied in reverse once it became clear that the Ten Hours Act had had no obvious detrimental effect on the prosperity of the textile industry or on that of millworkers.  Acts were passed making similar provisions for other textile trades: bleaching and dyeworks  (1860 - outdoor bleaching was excluded), lace work (1861), calendering (1863), finishing (1864).[1] A further Act in 1870 repealed these acts and brought the ancillary textile processes (including outdoor bleaching) within the scope of the main Factory Act.[102]  In 1864 the Factories Extension Act was passed: this extended the Factories Act to cover a number of occupations (mostly non-textile): potteries (both heat and exposure to lead glazes were issues), lucifer match making ('phossie jaw') percussion cap and cartridge making, paper staining and fustian cutting.[1]  In 1867 the Factories Act was extended to all establishments employing 50 or more workers by another Factories Act Extension Act.  An Hours of Labour Regulation Act applied to 'workshops' (establishments employing less than 50 workers); it subjected these to requirements similar to those for 'factories' (but less onerous on a number of points e.g.: the hours within which the permitted hours might be worked were less restrictive, there was no requirement for certification of age) but was to be administered by local authorities, rather than the Factory Inspectorate.[1] There was no requirement on local authorities for enforcement (or penalties for non-enforcement) of legislation for workshops. The effectiveness of the regulation of workshops therefore varied from area to area;[103] where it was effective, a blanket ban on Sunday working in workshops was a problem for observant Jews.[104] The Factory and Workshop Act 1870 removed the previous special treatments for factories in the printing, dyeing and bleaching industries;[105] while a short Act of 1871  transferred responsibility for regulation of workshops to the Factory Inspectorate,[106] but without an adequate increase in the Inspectorates's resources.[107]Â ; a separate Act allowed Sunday working by Jews.[108]
