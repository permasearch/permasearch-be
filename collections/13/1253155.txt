Staying Alive was blasted by film critics. Roger Ebert called the dance productions "laughably gauche", especially the final number, which he mocked for including "fire, ice, smoke, flashing lights and laser beams". Ebert added that what the film most lacked was "the sense of reality in "Saturday Night Fever"... There's no old neighborhood, no vulgar showdowns with his family (he apologizes to his mother for his "attitude"!) and no Brooklyn eccentricity."[5] In 2006, Entertainment Weekly dubbed Staying Alive the "Worst Sequel Ever."[6] Many critics were unanimous in agreeing that the film did not contain the grittiness and realism that Saturday Night Fever possessed. The film holds a score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews and with the consensus being "This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is shockingly embarrassing and unnecessary, trading the original's dramatic depth for a series of uninspired dance sequences."[7]
