Rangifer tarandus are ruminants, having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat lichens in winter, especially reindeer mossâ€”the "only large mammal able to metabolize lichen owing to specialized bacteria and protozoa in their gut."[63] Each ecotype eats a diet based on the surrounding ecology. Mountain caribou eat lichen from trees, for example. They have been known to eat their own fallen antlers, probably for calcium. They also eat the leaves of willows and birches, as well as sedges and grasses.
