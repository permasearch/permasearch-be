To better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act of 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the British Board of Customs.[25] The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.[26] Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.[27] The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver M. Dickerson, "The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board."[28]
