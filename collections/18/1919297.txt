Legal challenges centered on whether the income tax then in force constituted a "direct tax". In the Springer v. United States case of 1881,[1] the Supreme Court upheld the tax regime then in force. An 1894 statute was ruled unconstitutional in the case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company.[2] In response, the Sixteenth Amendment, proposed in 1909 and becoming law in 1913, cancelled the "apportionment" requirement for income taxes. Federal income tax was thereupon reintroduced in the Revenue Act of 1913. In the case of Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company (1916),[3] the 1913 Act was ruled to be constitutional. A separate excise tax was also imposed on corporations.
