Commonly attributed to Kanō Eitoku (1543–1590), there is an other theory based on a reference to a commission in The Diary of Prince Toshihito (智仁観王日記) that the painting was instead made by Eitoku's younger brother Kanō Sōshū (狩野宗秀).[2] The eight panels originally took the form of four painted shōji, later remounted, which helps account for some of the discontinuities in the image.[2][5] After the Meiji Restoration the paintings passed from the Katsura-no-miya to the Imperial Household and thence to the nation.[2]
