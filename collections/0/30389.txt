301 Mission Street is a development[7][5][8] in the South of Market district of downtown San Francisco.[1] A mixed-use, primarily residential development, it has the tallest residential building in San Francisco.[5] The blue-gray glass, late-modernist buildings are bounded by Mission, Fremont, and Beale Streets, and the north end of the Transbay Transit Center site.[9][10] Opened to residents on April 23, 2009,[9][10] 301 Mission includes two buildings: a 12-story tower located on the northeast of the property,[4][1] and Millennium Tower, a 58-story,[7][5][8] 645-foot-tall (197 m) condominium skyscraper.[1] The mixed-use, primarily residential structure is the tallest residential building in San Francisco.[5] In total, the project has 419 residential units,[2] with 53 of those units in the smaller tower.[1] The tower's highest level, 58 floors above the ground,[4][9][10] is listed as the 60th, because floors 13 and 44 are missing for superstitious reasons.[7] The French restaurant and wine bar[11] RN74 is housed on the ground floor of the skyscraper.[11][12] Resident services include a private concierge and access to the 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) Owner's Club Level, which features amenities such as a private lounge, wine cellar, and fitness center. The development's "lifestyle" program organizes cultural events.[11] In May 2016,[13] residents were informed the main tower was both sinking and tilting,[14] resulting in several lawsuits concerning repair costs and whether the tilt had been withheld from buyers.[13]
