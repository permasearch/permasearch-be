Sandy Wexler (Adam Sandler) is a talent manager working in Los Angeles in the 1990s, diligently, albeit erratically, representing a group of eccentric clients on the fringes of show business. His skills as a manager are challenged when he discovers a genuinely talented singer, Courtney Clarke (Jennifer Hudson). The Wexler character is a satirical homage to Sandler's real-life manager Sandy Wernick.[1]
