The album was the follow-up to Kay Slay's The Streetsweeper, Vol. 1 released the previous year. This album followed the same format as the last, several of hip-hop's biggest artists, including 50 Cent and Eminem, perform songs produced by prominent hip hop producers ranging from Swizz Beatz to Kanye West. Kay Slay himself does not rap on nor produce any of the songs, rather he serves as the executive producer and ad-libs on some of the songs.
