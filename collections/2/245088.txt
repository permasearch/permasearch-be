The most successful charting version in the UK was recorded by the Scottish singer Natasha, whose version reached number 10 on the UK singles chart in 1982.[14] The song also charted highly in Ireland, Israel and New Zealand. The single was produced by Tom Newman.[15] A remix of the single was released in 2007, and Natasha's version enjoyed a resurgence in 2014 when it was included on the soundtrack to the highest-grossing Italian film of 2014, A Boss in the Living Room (Un Boss in Salotto).[16]
