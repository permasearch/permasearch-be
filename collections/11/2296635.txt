When production of season three began, someone with the username "ExecProducer" started a thread on the official Degrassi: The Next Generation website,[16] revealing production details, guest actors, scheduling information and DVD release details. He actually referred to himself as "Stephen Stohn" in one post, although this was not officially confirmed until the release of Degrassi: Generations - The Official 411 guidebook in 2005, when Stohn confirmed it was him.[17]
