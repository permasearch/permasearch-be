The Interstate Bridge was replaced on the existing foundations starting on November 1, 2004 in a joint project between the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). The 13-month project was budgeted to cost $6.45 million (equivalent to $8.36 million in 2018).[2][4] Demolition started in the center of the bridge, sawing the deck into pieces for disposal. Barges were positioned to catch concrete, preventing it from entering the river. Coffer dams were installed so the piers could be broken up and removed as well.[5] This reconstruction was completed ahead of schedule, with the span reopening on November 22, 2005. The project completely replaced the bridge above the water line with wider 12-foot (3.7 m) traffic lanes, new 5-foot (1.5 m) bicycle lanes and wider 7-foot (2.1 m) sidewalks. Images of wild rice were sculpted into the concrete making up the bridge because "Menominee" in the local Menominee language means "wild rice". These sculptures were added in addition to the other decorative elements added to the new bridge including the railings and light poles. Construction of the Interstate Bridge coincided with a project to replace the span between Marinette and Stephenson Island, which was also built in 1929, and a refurbishment of US 41 through Marinette.[6]
