The Monster Energy Drink logo is widely recognized among major beverages and at sponsored events. The design was created by McLean Design, a California-based strategic branding firm. The logo is composed of a vibrant large green ″M″ on a field of black. The ″M″ is stylized in such a way as to imply that it is formed by the claws of a monster ripping through the can.[11]
