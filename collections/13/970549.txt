While a proposal to bring pro football back to the Los Angeles area was still in the works (at the time), there had been little action taken in the last years of the NFL's absence from the Los Angeles market to bring an NFL team to the Coliseum. Up until 2013, USC had a series of mostly one- and two-year leases with the commission.[71] In November 2007, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared that the policy of requiring the NFL to relocate to the Coliseum would change and other options would be explored.[72] The Coliseum Commission's June 23, 2008 decision to sell naming rights to the stadium had signaled a likely end to the prospects of the NFL's returning to the Coliseum as the prospect of a naming-rights deal by a future NFL team tenant could have helped lure a new pro team.[60]
