Meanwhile, Kham fought one level below Ping-Ping and the ignited gasoline has turned the entire lower floor into a room of fire. Taking advantage of the fire, Kham set his own shoes on fire to use it to defeat his enemies; they in turn copied him. Kham then fought No. 2 again, this time at lowest section, the train tracks. The two fought right over a live rail and took advantage of the electricity to shock each other while fighting in light-saber effect mortal combat; Kham knocked out No.2 and confronted LC. To Kham's surprise, LC is highly trained and marked himself as No.00. The fight was short-lived as both men fell from a high place, LC was knocked out.
