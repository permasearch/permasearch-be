"Dancing with Myself" is a song written by singer Billy Idol and bassist Tony James, first recorded by their band Generation X in 1979. The song was re-recorded and commercially released by the band newly re-branded as Gen X as a 7" single and a 12" in October 1980, but was a sales failure, reaching only #62 in the UK Singles Chart. It was then included on the band's subsequent album Kiss Me Deadly (1981).
