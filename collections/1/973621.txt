Oliver is upset when his band fails an audition to play at the school dance. To make matters worse, Hannah lands a role in an upcoming movie, causing Oliver to feel even more insecure. Oliver avoids Miley for a while because she always gets everything she wants. To show Oliver what an understanding friend she is, Miley decides to blow the next audition with the director, Rob Reiner, by acting like a total diva, but her plan backfires when Rob is impressed by Hannah's acting skills. Meanwhile, Rico ruins the dummy Jackson is going to use for his ventriloquist show, so Jackson uses Rico as the substitute at a birthday party performance. Rico makes Jackson look really bad in front of the kids, but they enjoy the show anyway.
