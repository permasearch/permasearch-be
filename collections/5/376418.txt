The following is a list of NBA All-Stars, players who have been selected for the NBA All-Star Game at least once in their career.[5] Note that the number indicates the player's number of selectionsâ€”not the number of games played. For instance, Michael Jordan was named to the All-Star Game roster 14 times, but missed the 1986 game due to injury.[6] As of the 2018 All-Star Game, 417 players have been selected to an All-Star Game roster at least once. However, only 286 of them have earned multiple selections to the game.
