Lucius Malfoy and Yaxley meet to discuss Lord Voldemort's defeat at the hands of Harry Potter. Lucius describes that if it were not for Harry Potter, they would be reigning supreme. Lucius then explains his plan to use a Time Turner to go back in time to Harry's first year at Hogwarts to destroy him before he can become a threat for the Death Eaters ("Not Over Yet").
