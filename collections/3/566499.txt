Cochineal is probably from French cochenille, Spanish cochinilla, Latin coccinus, meaning 'scarlet-colored', and Latin coccum, meaning 'berry (actually an insect) yielding scarlet dye'. See also the related word kermes which is the source of a similar but weaker Mediterranean dye also called crimson, which was used to color cloth red before discovery of cochineal in the New World. Some sources identify the Spanish source word for cochineal as cochinilla "wood louse" (a diminutive form of Spanish cochino, cognate with French cochon, meaning "pig")."[3]
