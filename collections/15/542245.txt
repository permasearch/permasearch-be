During the short reign of Emperor Taishō Japan developed stronger democratic institutions and grew in international power. The Taishō political crisis opened the period with mass protests and riots organized by Japanese political parties, which succeeded in forcing Katsura Tarō to resign as prime minister.[211] This and the rice riots of 1918 increased the power of Japan's political parties over the ruling oligarchy.[212] The Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties came to dominate politics by the end of the so-called "Taishō democracy" era.[213] The franchise for the House of Representatives had been gradually expanded since 1890,[214] and in 1925 universal male suffrage was introduced. However, in the same year the far-reaching Peace Preservation Law also passed, prescribing harsh penalties for political dissidents.[215]
