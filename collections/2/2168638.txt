In stories by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, the Scarecrow is depicted as one of the more deranged criminals in Batman's rogues gallery, with a habit of speaking in nursery rhymes.[14] These stories further revise his backstory, explaining that he was raised by his fanatically religious grandmother, whom he murdered as a teenager.[9]
