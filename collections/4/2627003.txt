Nachega & Chaisson argue that inadequate TB control programs are the strongest driver of MDR-TB incidence.[63] They note that prevalence of MDR-TB is 2.5 times higher in areas of poorly controlled TB.[63] Russian-based therapy (i.e., not DOTS) has been criticized by Kimerling et al. as “inadequate” in properly controlling TB incidence and transmission.[71] Bobrik et al. note that treatment for MDR-TB is equally inconsistent; the second-line drugs used to treat the prisoners lack specific treatment guidelines, infrastructure, training, or follow-up protocols for prisoners reentering civilian life.[64]
