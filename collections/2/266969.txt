Soon after the hurricane struck, Whitefish Energy—a small Montana-based company with only two full-time employees—was awarded a $300 million contract by PREPA to repair Puerto Rico's power grid. The company contracted more than 300 personnel and sent them to the island to carry out work. PREPA cited Whitefish's comparatively small upfront cost of $3.7 million for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies. PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos stated: "Whitefish was the only company -- it was the first that could be mobilized to Puerto Rico. It did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay".[220] No requests for assistance were made to the American Public Power Association by October 24.[220] The decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many, such as former Energy Department official Susan Tierney, who stated: "The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out, it is at least odd why [the utility] would go to Whitefish”. As the company was based in Whitefish, Mont., the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, this also led to accusations of privatization, though Zinke dismissed these claims and stated that he had no role in securing the contract.[221] Several representatives, both Democrats and Republicans, also voiced their concern over the choice to contract Whitefish instead of other companies.[220]
