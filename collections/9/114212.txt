For 2003, new options became available, including side-curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system. Audio systems were upgraded, the premium 6-disc, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD setup being replaced by a 6-speaker 300W Rockford Fosgate AM/FM/CD system with an 8-inch subwoofer that took up a small portion of the rear storage area. Although 2004 was the last year for this generation, some models were made as late as January 2005.
