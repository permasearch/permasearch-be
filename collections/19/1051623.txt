In detail, the terms     N (  d  1   ) , N (  d  2   )   {\displaystyle N(d_{1}),N(d_{2})}   are the probabilities of the option expiring in-the-money under the equivalent exponential martingale probability measure (numéraire=stock) and the equivalent martingale probability measure (numéraire=risk free asset), respectively.[13] The risk neutral probability density for the stock price      S  T   ∈ ( 0 , ∞ )   {\displaystyle S_{T}\in (0,\infty )}   is
