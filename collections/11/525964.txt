Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control, Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women's Rights Declaration.[114] As a consequence, many civilians had fled to areas under his control.[115][116] In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban.[117]
