The following morning, the colt came out of the race tired but in good shape.[80] When Baffert brought American Pharoah out of the Belmont Park barn, he invited the assembled media to come over and pet the horse. "I wanted to share him with everybody and show everybody how kind and sweet he is," said Baffert, while the group of about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse.[31] The horse then posed quietly with Baffert and Espinoza to tape a segment for The Today Show, standing between the two men who were seated in folding director's chairs.[80]
