Lysozyme crystals have been used to grow other functional materials for catalysis and biomedical applications.[39][40][41] Lysozyme is a commonly used enzyme for lysing gram negative bacteria.[42] Due to the unique function of lysozyme in which it can digest the cell wall and causes osmotic shock (burst the cell by suddenly change in solute concentration around the cell and thus the osmotic pressure), lysozyme is commonly used in lab setting to release proteins from bacterium periplasm while the inner membrane remains sealed as vesicles called the spheroplast.[43][44]
