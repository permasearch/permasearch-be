The relationships between meeting the educational needs of children with language difficulties and the findings of neuroscience studies are not yet established. One concrete avenue for progress is to use neuroscientific methods to address questions that are significant to practice in learning environments. For example, the extent to which language skills are attributable to a single common trait, and the consistency of such a trait over development, are matters of debate.[39] However, direct assessments of brain activity can inform these debates.[40] A detailed understanding of the sub-components of the language system, and the ways these change over time may inevitably yield implications for educational practice.
