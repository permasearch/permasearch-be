The genome of HHV-7 is very similar to that of HHV-6, although it is about 10% smaller,[17] with a DNA genome of about 145,000 base pairs.[8] There are a number of key differences between the genome of HHV-7 and that of HHV-6, but the importance of them for viral DNA replication is not yet known.[8]
