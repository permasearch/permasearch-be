Much of this article exhibits a strong bias towards justifying Roosevelt's imperialistic policies. That the Roosevelt Corollary was added to intervene 'when governmental corruption made it necessary', and that Roosevelt intended to 'help' "underdeveloped" nations seem particularly absurd an strongly exemplify a racist and paternalistic justification of violent intervention into Latin American nations. Considering much of T.R.'s legacy is cementing an aggressive imperialist approach to hemispherical affairs it is very important to amend this article.
