The Remote Desktop Gateway service component, also known as RD Gateway, can tunnel the RDP session using a HTTPS channel.[14] This increases the security of RDS by encapsulating the session with Transport Layer Security (TLS)[15] This also allows the option to use Internet Explorer as the RDP client. The official MS RDP client for Mac OS X supports RD Gateway as of version 8. This is also available for iOS and Android.
