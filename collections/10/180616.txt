In 2013, new proposals by the Electoral Commission for the 16-week regulated period preceding the poll were accepted. They allowed the two designated campaign organisations to spend up to £1.5 million each and for the parties in Scotland to spend the following amounts: £1,344,000 (SNP); £834,000 (Labour); £396,000 (Conservatives); £201,000 (Liberal Democrats); £150,000 (Greens).[45] An unlimited number of other organisations could register with the Electoral Commission, but their spending was limited to £150,000.[48] Groups spending more than £250,000 were required to submit audited returns to the Commission by 18 March 2015.[49]
