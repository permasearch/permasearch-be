A comet may be discovered photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even without access to optical equipment, it is still possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO.[185] SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer MichaÅ‚ Kusiak on 26 December 2010[186] and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).
