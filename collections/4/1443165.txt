Two months to deadline, Disney discovered the float contractor was far behind schedule and decided to finish the floats itself in a backstage area at Disneyland.[5] Disney brought on welders, electricians and other temporary workers to assemble the floats and hand-tint and install 500,000 bulbs.[5] The first rehearsal was a disaster; a float crashed into a building on Main Street, U.S.A., and some performers' costumes emitted sparks.[5] Despite these obstacles, the parade successfully debuted on schedule on June 17, 1972.[5]
