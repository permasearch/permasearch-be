In 2007, the families/descendants of the surviving children came together in Utah, for the 150th anniversary of the massacre.  The family stories were compared and found to be very similar.  All of the families agree the stories told of Mormons dressed as Natives, and that none of the Native people participated in the Massacre of the wagon train. Family stories tell of being taken by "Indians who washed of their skin and turned white".
