The Boston Manufacturing Company built its first mill next to the Charles River in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814.[1] Unlike the prevailing system of textile manufacturing at the time—the "Rhode Island System" established by Samuel Slater—Lowell decided to hire young women (usually single) between the ages of 15 and 35, who became known as Mill Girls. They were called "operatives" because they operated the looms and other machinery.[4]
