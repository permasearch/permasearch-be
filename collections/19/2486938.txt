Döner kebab is popular in many countries in the form of fast food, often as an end to a night out when preceded by the consumption of alcohol.[64] Health concerns regarding döner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and re-heating of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, have been reported in the media.[64][65][66][67] Lean meat, wholemeal bread, and salad can be considered healthy eating choices, but large amounts of oil-based sauces, added salt, fatty meat, and overly large portions may contribute to significant health risks.[68]
