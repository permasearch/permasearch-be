While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,[21] graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.
