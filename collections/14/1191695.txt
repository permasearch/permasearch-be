Suddenly Last Summer is a one-act play by Tennessee Williams. It opened off Broadway on January 7, 1958, as part of a double bill with another of Williams' one-acts, Something Unspoken (written in 1958).  The presentation of the two plays was given the overall title Garden District, but Suddenly Last Summer is now more often performed alone.[1] Williams said he thought the play "perhaps the most poetic" he had written,[2] and Harold Bloom ranks it among the best examples of the playwright's lyricism.[3]
