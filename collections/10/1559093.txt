After their disastrous results in their previous attempts, the two take a break at a diner, and decide to "try being nice". However, this is unsuccessful, ending in Patrick buying pictures of a customer as an overweight child, as is their attempt to "focus" (resulting in Patrick staring at a customer until the customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes). Then, they decide that the only way to sell chocolate is to "stretch the truth", which is successful when they convince a very old woman (to the dismay of her daughter Mary) that it "makes you live forever". The lying continues, but after they attempt to help a seriously injured man (who turns out to be the same man who sold SpongeBob and Patrick the carrying bags in disguise) by buying his chocolate, their profit is lost. However, the chocolate fanatic catches up to them, and, in a turn of events, buys all of the chocolate that SpongeBob and Patrick have. They then use the money to rent out a fancy restaurant, allowing access only to themselves and their dates, the old lady and her daughter who they sold chocolate to earlier.
