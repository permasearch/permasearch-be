The BBC won a "bidding war" with ITV, paying Â£22 million for the rights to broadcast the show in the UK for two years. ITV's Britain's Got Talent launched its sixth series on the same date of 24 March 2012.[2] Many media outlets saw this move as a deliberate attempt by ITV to create a "TV ratings war" with the BBC.[3]
