In 1999 in the town of Morioh (杜王町, Moriō-chō) located in S-City, M-Prefecture (M県S市, Emu-ken, Esu-shi), Josuke Higashikata (東方 仗助, Higashikata Jōsuke, the kanji 助 suke, can also be read as jo) is a popular boy in high school who becomes quick friends with one of his classmates, Koichi Hirose.  Josuke is the illegitimate child of Joseph Joestar, born from a relationship with a Japanese woman, making him the uncle of Joseph's grandson Jotaro Kujo. Jotaro's arrival in Morioh pulls Josuke into the world of the supernatural powers known as Stands, as he becomes involved in Jotaro's search for a Stand-creating Bow and Arrow which was brought to Morioh by one of DIO's henchmen. One of these new Stand users is the murderer Anjuro "Angelo" Katagiri, who uses his Stand Aqua Necklace to try and kill Josuke for interfering with his criminal activity in Morioh. Aqua Necklace manages to kill Josuke's grandfather, Ryohei Higashikata, in revenge for him being jailed by him. With Jotaro's help, Josuke uses his own Stand, Crazy Diamond, to defeat Angelo.
