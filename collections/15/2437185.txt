Petechiae can be used by police investigators in determining if strangulation has been part of an attack. The documentation of the presence of petechiae on a victim can help police investigators prove the case.[8]  Petechiae resulting from strangulation can be relatively tiny and light in color to very bright and pronounced.  Petechiae may be seen on the face, in the whites of the eyes or on the inside of the eyelids.
