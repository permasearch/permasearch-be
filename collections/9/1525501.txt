Marital satisfaction remains but other family relationships can be more difficult. Career satisfaction focuses more on inner satisfaction and contentedness and less on ambition and the desire to "advance".[8] Even so, career changes often can occur. Middle adulthood or middle age can be a time when a person re-examines their life by taking stock, and evaluating their accomplishments. Morality may change and become more conscious. The perception that those in this stage of development or life undergo a "mid-life" crisis is largely false. This period in life is usually satisfying, tranquil. Personality characteristics remain stable throughout this period.[1]  The relationships in middle adulthood may continue to evolve into connections that are stable.[8]
