As noted above, the majority of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast.[2] Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, recorded the film's score with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic.[21] Music supervisor and conductor Paul Gemignani instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. Jonathan Tunick orchestrated Sondheim's original music.[21] The key to the song, "Hello, Little Girl," was altered to better suit Johnny Depp's lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained, "we emphasized the woodwinds to make it feel a little lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it a little jazzier â€” played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has a jazz feel, it just feels lighter."[75] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 15, 2014.[76]
