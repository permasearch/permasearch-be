Historically, municipal debt predates corporate debt by several centuriesâ€”the early Renaissance Italian city-states borrowed money from major banking families. Borrowing by American cities dates to the nineteenth century, and records of U.S. municipal bonds indicate use around the early 1800s.  Officially the first recorded municipal bond was a general obligation bond issued by the City of New York for a canal in 1812.   During the 1840s, many U.S. cities were in debt, and by 1843 cities had roughly $25 million in outstanding debt.  In the ensuing decades, rapid urban development demonstrated a correspondingly explosive growth in municipal debt.  The debt was used to finance both urban improvements and a growing system of free public education.
