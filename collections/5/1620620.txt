The business and affairs of a British Virgin Islands company are managed by its board of directors.[17]  The board must consist of one or more persons, and these may be individuals or companies.  Directors owe strict duties of good faith to exercise their powers for a proper purpose and in the best interests of the company.[18]  In relative terms, directors are comparatively powerful under British Virgin Islands law.  In most cases directors can appoint further directors and amend the company's constitution.  There are extremely few matters of corporate governance whereby the board is required to obtain the approval of the company's members.
