Ludwig Göransson was hired to compose the film's score by April 2017.[103] Göransson traveled to Senegal and South Africa to record local musicians to form the "base" of his soundtrack.[137] Kendrick Lamar produced the film's curated soundtrack, Black Panther: The Album, along with Top Dawg Entertainment founder Anthony Tiffith. Coogler chose Lamar for the project because his "artistic themes align with those we explore in the film".[138] Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: "All the Stars",[138] "King's Dead",[139] and "Pray for Me".[140] Black Panther: The Album was released on February 9, 2018,[141] while a soundtrack of Göransson's score was released on February 16, 2018.[142]
