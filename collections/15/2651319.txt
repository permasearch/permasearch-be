"You Light Up My Life" became a running joke in an episode of Girlfriends (titled "Can't Stan Ya!"). Maya and Stan (who had been seeing each other) share a kiss; she feels guilty afterwards and decides to break things off with him to focus on her marriage. While attempting to do this, Stan serenades her with the song and doesn't allow Maya to break her news to him. Lynn offers to tell Stan on Maya's behalf (in exchange for Maya to talk her mother in reducing Lynn's rent on the garage); she then sings the song to Maya as a form of blackmail. At the episode's end, Maya arrives home where Darnell - and Stan - are now playing a video game (a hurt and angry Stan has decided to "befriend" Darnell to get back at Maya). Stan starts to hum the song during the game, prompting Darnell to join him. Darnell then exclaims "You Light Up My Life! Maya, you remember that? That used to be your mama's jam back in the day!"
