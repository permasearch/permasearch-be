You In Your Small Corner was rediscovered during preparations for a November 2015 British Film Institute panel discussion on "Race and Romance on TV" and was used in publicity for the event. As a result, panel moderator Samira Ahmed was able, on the night, to announce the rediscovery of an even earlier TV kiss by Lloyd Reckord, with Andr√©e Melly, in the ITV Armchair Theatre adaptation of Ted Willis's play Hot Summer Night, broadcast on 1 February 1959.[2][3]
