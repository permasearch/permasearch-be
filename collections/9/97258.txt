If     σ ≫ ω  ϵ  0    ϵ  r     {\displaystyle \sigma \gg \omega \epsilon _{0}\epsilon _{r}}   the material is a good conductor or a poor insulator and substantially reflects the radio waves that are incident upon it with almost the same power.[6] Therefore, virtually no RF power is absorbed by the material itself and virtually none is transmitted, even if it is very thin. All metals are good conductors and there are of course many examples that cause significant reflections of radio waves in the urban environment, for example bridges, metal clad buildings, storage warehouses, aircraft and electrical power transmission towers or pylons.
