John Jackson "Jack-Jack" Parr (voiced by Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews in the first film, Eric and Stuart Bluth in the second film) is the Parrs' infant son, the youngest of the Parr children. Initially believed to be the only family member without any powers, he manifests a multitude of superhuman abilities at the end of the film, most of which are types of shapeshifting. More powers are seen in the short film Jack-Jack Attack on the Incredibles DVD, making his powers the most versatile of the family, and according to a collectible poster included with some Incredibles toys, still more powers are undisclosed.
