After the departure of Kelly and Ryan, Toby appears more excited with the arrival of the two twenty-somethings who are single like himself. He appears to see them as closer friends than they see him but neither of them treats him meanly either. He convinced both of them, along with Kevin and Darryl, to grow moustaches from "Movember", believing this was a bonding activity. He was disappointed when Pete shaved his moustache off after Erin found it off-putting.
