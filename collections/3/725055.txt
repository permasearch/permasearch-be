The techniques above have been used by scientist, but the most popularized techniques are Naked DNA and DNA complexes. The injection of the Naked DNA is the simplest method of the vector delivery method. The Naked DNA is a histone-free, modified DNA sequence that removes proteins that would normally surround it. This form of delivery is sometimes used as a natural compound, but the United States has been making large waves of synthetic compounds for gene delivery. The other form, which is DNA Complexes, has been used when a compound is crossed with a chemical mix in order to produce the desired compound. There are other studies that are currently underway that have been referred to as the hybrid method because there is a combination of two or more gene therapy techniques used. This can instill the idea that the desired gene will stick during the delivery, transfer, and implant.
