Children with CP are prone to low trauma fractures, particularly children with higher GMFCS levels who cannot walk. This further impacts on a child's mobility, strength, experience of pain, and can lead to missed schooling or child abuse suspicions.[20] These children generally have fractures in the legs, whereas non-affected children mostly fracture their arms in the context of sporting activities.[22]
