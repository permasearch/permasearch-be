The route suffered some setbacks during the first two weeks of operation, which called into question the feasibility of the route.[17][18][19] On 21 May 2011, less than a week after commencing operations on the route, Qantas offloaded three containers of luggage in Dallas in order to reach Brisbane without the need to make an unplanned stop for fuel. Affected passengers waited 24 hours for their luggage to arrive via Los Angeles. Qantas claimed they were forced to make the decision "due to load restrictions as a result of unseasonably strong winds."[18] On 23 May, Flight 7 was forced to divert to Houston because it lacked enough fuel to circle Dallas until thunderstorms—typical during summertime—cleared, resulting in a two-hour delay.[19] Then on 30 May, Flight 8 made an unplanned stop in Nouméa, New Caledonia, when its pilots decided it was safer to stop and refuel there than continue on to Brisbane.[19][20]. Again On 18 Feb, 2018 Flight 7 was forced to divert to Houston because it lacked enough fuel to circle Dallas due to thunderstorms.[21]
