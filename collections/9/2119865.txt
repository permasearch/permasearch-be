In the season two episode "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut", Cartman is told that Liane is a hermaphrodite (has both male and female genitalia) and that she is actually his father, having impregnated an unknown woman. However, in the season fourteen episode "200", Mr. Garrison tells Cartman that this was actually a cover-up. In the following episode "201", it's revealed that it was a lie the entire town told to protect the Denver Broncos American football team, especially since they were in the midst of a Super Bowl run. Jack, a Broncos player, was Cartman's actual father and Liane is his mother after all, meaning also that his nemesis Scott Tenorman is his half-brother. Cartman, however is more distraught to learn that he is "half ginger", than to realize that he fed his own father to his half-brother.
