In April 2003, Viacom announced that TNN would be relaunched as Spike TV on June 16, 2003. Promoted with the slogan "The First Network for Men", Viacom aimed to target a young adult male demographic between the ages of 18-34â€”which they believed was being served insufficiently by other cable networks, and to further distance the network from the TNN name in order to suit its current programming direction. Spike's launch programming would include a slate of new adult animation series such as Gary the Rat, Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon" (an adult-oriented revival of the former Nickelodeon series The Ren & Stimpy Show, led by its original creator John Kricfalusi), and Stripperella, as well as other new series such as Ride with Funkmaster Flex. Also planned were segments in collaboration with Men's Health, Stuff, and CBS Marketwatch. Recent acquisitions, such as CSI,  WWE Raw, and Star Trek, would also remain part of the network's schedule.[20]
