The largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.[20] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[21] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[22] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[23]
