By 21 October, the United States 24th Infantry Division, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade leading, crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang and headed north. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were in the van, and by nightfall the Brigade halted on the outskirts of Yongyu, 21 miles (34Â km) north of Pyongyang. A patrol from the Argylls entered the town and made contact with elements of the U.S. 3rd Battalion, 187th Regimental Combat Team.
