The movie is an epic portrayal of a powerful Texas ranching family challenged by changing times and the coming of big oil.[11] A major subplot concerns the racism of many Anglo-European Americans in Texas during the mid twentieth century and the discriminatory social segregation enforced against Mexican Americans.[12] In the first third of the film, Bick and Luz treat the Mexicans who work on their ranch condescendingly, which upsets the more socially-conscious Leslie. Bick eventually comes to realize his moral shortcomings – in a climactic scene at a roadside diner he loses a fistfight to the racist owner, but earns Leslie's respect for defending the human rights of his brown-skinned daughter-in-law and grandson. Another subplot involves Leslie's own striving for women's equal rights as she defies the patriarchal social order, asserting herself and expressing her own opinions when the men talk. She protests being expected to suppress her beliefs in deference to Bick's; this conflict leads to their temporary separation.[13]
