On October 30, 2016, Murphy announced that a future crossover season of the series will continue the Murder House and Coven stories, merging their characters and themes. He did not state which season it would be, but that he had already reached out to actors from both seasons to reprise their respective roles.[21] Murphy later confirmed one of the Murder House characters will be moved in the season finale of Coven. However, on January 5, 2018, it was initially announced that the crossover season will be taking place in the ninth season, but on June 14, 2018, the crossover was moved from Season 9 to the upcoming eighth season instead.
