The common raven and carrion crow have been blamed for killing weak lambs and are often seen eating freshly dead corpses probably killed by other means. The Australian raven has been documented chasing, attacking, and seriously injuring lambs.[43] Rooks have been blamed for eating grain in the UK and brown-necked ravens for raiding date crops in desert countries.[44]
