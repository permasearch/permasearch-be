Madison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the framersâ€™ original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: "the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward," Madison told George Hay in 1823.[34] Hamilton went further. He actually drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.[35]
