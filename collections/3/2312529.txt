The caves overlook the ancient Agatsyateerth pond, built sometime in the 5th century. Just behind the archaeological museum, there is a long stairway that leads to the fortification on the top of the hill. Most people who come to Badami do not venture this way, this is the best thing about the place. There are a couple of Chalukya temples on the top covered with intricate carvings. On the northern side of the pond is a group of Shiva temples, called the Bhoothnath temples.
