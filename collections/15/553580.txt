Reservation in India is a form of affirmative action designed to improve the well-being of backward and under-represented communities defined primarily by their caste. Reservation in India favors the majority of the population with more than 70% of Indian Citizens eligible for reservation benefits. [43] 49.5% of all college admissions and government jobs are reserved for this 70% majority but they can also compete for the remaining 51.5% unreserved quota as well [44]. Further, only 0.6% of scholarships disbursed by the government were given on the basis of merit, with over 94% of the scholarships given on basis of Reservation instead [45].
