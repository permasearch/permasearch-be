Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments[65]—there are about one million of them in a teaspoon of seawater[66]—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.[67] Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.[68]
