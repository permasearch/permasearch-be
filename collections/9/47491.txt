In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military junta period, changes in land legislation allowed the subdivision of land plots.[12] This opened the island to massive unplanned and unregulated urban and suburban development, including many weekend homes, especially along the northern and eastern coasts. The lack of corresponding investment in infrastructure, combined with heavy industry, has led to sea and beach pollution on this side of the island. There are, however, ongoing initiatives such as help from the European Unionâ€™s Cohesion Fund toward improving sewerage by 2008.[13]
