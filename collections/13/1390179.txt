The video begins with Mars displaying sadness as he reminisces about the moments spent between him and his "brunette vixen" girlfriend in an "sparsely" decorated apartment.[11][59][60] Throughout the video, the singer expresses his emptiness and devastation recurring to solo shots in which he stands "around looking sullen" and by using "faded lighting" in order to convey such sentiments.[4][61] Flashes of the two of them giggling, kissing, snuggling, pouring out romance and being "playful" are shown, as the singer apparently misses their relationship.[11][59][61] After the opening sequence, Mars holds a private screening of "Breaking Dawn" to please her, the couple kiss in front of a cinema projector lights, while romantic scenes from the Breaking Dawn: Part 1, including the honeymoon and the one where Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, sweeps Bella, portrayed by Kristen Stewart, "off her feet and into their new home", are projected on the wall.[4][11][60][61] As the video continues, the couple begins to fight, leading to more "heated arguments and lonely nights".[59][61] At this point, Mars, possibly, writes a song to purse her to stay with him.[61] A critic believed the song written only helped Mars to lead with the break up by telling the story.[11] Nevertheless, MTV's, Jocelyn Vena stated "we see that the song Bruno wrote while his lady was asleep turned out to be romantic enough to win her back."[61] The video ends with Mats revisiting scenes of the relationship and being set back to the present.[11] In the final shot the singer is alone as rain pours down and hits the window behind him.[61]
