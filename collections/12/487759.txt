Ask-Elizabeth was also the working title of a reality series focusing on the program's success and its continued efforts to help girls throughout the country.[36] The show, produced by MTV,[37] featured Berkley traveling around the United States looking at the issues and topics most important to teenage girls. Amy Bailey, vice president of development in MTV's News & Documentaries division, said Berkley approached MTV with the idea. "She does these workshops around the country with teen girls and gets them to really open up about self-esteem and body issues," said Bailey. "We had been looking for a program that tackled the same issues, so it seemed like a perfect match."[38] The status of the show itself is unknown as it was originally expected to premiere in late 2008, but production has since been pushed back indefinitely.
