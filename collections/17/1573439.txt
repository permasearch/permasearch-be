Siad placed third in cycle 10 of America's Next Top Model. She received three first call-outs and four bottom-two appearances, the same number as winner Whitney Thompson. She won one challenge, in which she received 50 extra frames for her photo shoot. Siad was criticized for not being able to take direction well. She was given long, chestnut brown extensions as part of her makeover. Siad missed a photo shoot, unable to get travel documents which she allegedly lost in Atlanta. That almost cost her the competition, as she landed in the bottom two along with Stacy-Ann Fequiere, but a stronger, improving portfolio saved her. Siad also survived the bottom two over Amis Jenkins and Dominique Reighard.
