Obito Uchiha (うちは オビト, Uchiha Obito), also known under his alias Tobi (トビ) is the true leader of Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi's teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin when she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito's right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter's original left eye. But Obito finds himself saved at the second by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics while conditioning him to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin's death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara's name following the latter's death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko's death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.[ch. 602, 606] Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragic prior to the series, including Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not supporting Kakashi to protect Rin[ch. 501] Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to manipulate Kamui in a fashion that made it seem he is intangible and teleport over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama's cells.[ch. 310, 395]
