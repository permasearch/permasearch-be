The position may be different in the case of long-range planning, since it may look decades ahead. The effort involved in such a process may mean that such forecasts are repeated less frequently; typically every three to four years, rather than three to four times a year. This is acceptable when the time horizon is two decades or more – since any interim changes are unlikely to have direct impact on the shorter-term budgets – though any major changes detected should, even so, prompt an immediate review.
