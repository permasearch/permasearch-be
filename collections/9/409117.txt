Captain Hook is later visited by Captain Nemo who gives him some advice on how to tell Emma about how he had previously killed David's father Robert. In addition, Captain Nemo states that he, Liam Jones II, and his crew are heading out of Storybrooke. After a disastrous outcome with Emma upon being unable to come clean in the first place, Captain Hook informs Captain Nemo about it and asks if there is room for one more. Captain Nemo states that there is always a place for him on the Nautilus. After some talking with Mary Margaret Blanchard, Captain Hook meets with Captain Nemo to see him off only for Gideon to commandeer the Nautilus where he has it leave Storybrooke.
