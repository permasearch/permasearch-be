Beckett's training officer after leaving the academy was Mike Royce; who according to Beckett was "the only one who understood the obsession that drove [her]". One of their cases involved a karaoke bar; another involved a monkey. While she tells Royce that she was in love with him, she later reveals that she was lying by saying it in order to keep him talking on the phone long enough to get a trace. However, after telling Castle that she lied about loving Royce, she walks off with tears clearly visible in her eyes.
