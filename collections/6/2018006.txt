Article I acknowledged the Roman Catholic faith as the "dominant religion," but guaranteed tolerance and freedom to all religions.[36][65] It was less progressive than the 16th-century Warsaw Confederation, and placed Poland clearly within the Catholic sphere of influence.[80] Article II confirmed many old privileges of the nobility, stressing that all nobles are equal and should enjoy personal security and the right to property.[81] Article III stipulated that the earlier Free Royal Cities Act (Miasta Nasze Królewskie Wolne w Państwach Rzeczypospolitej) of 18 (or 21) April 1791, was integral to the constitution. Personal security—neminem captivabimus, the Polish habeas corpus act—was extended to townspeople (including Jews). Townspeople also gained the right to acquire landed property and became eligible for military officers' commissions and public offices, such as reserved seats in the Sejm and seats in the executive commissions of the Treasury, the Police and the Judiciary.[10][70] Membership of the nobility was also made easier for burghers to acquire.[82]
