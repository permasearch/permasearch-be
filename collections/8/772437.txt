In "Post Mortem", an elderly woman named Penny Garden was found dead, lying through her living room window. It was revealed that she was dying from cancer, and was heavily medicated. Her medication wasn't found at the scene, leading Grissom's team to assume that stealing the medication was the motive of the murder. This led to the suspicion that Penny's reformed-junkie of a nephew was the murderer. However, this theory was put aside when the nephew brought forward a miniature model depicting the murder scene, which was apparently delivered shortly after the CSIs left the scene.
