Cell types: Neurons in the nucleus accumbens are mostly medium spiny neurons (MSNs) containing mainly D1-type (i.e., DRD1 and DRD5) or D2-type (i.e., DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) dopamine receptors.   A subpopulation of MSNs contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors, with approximatelyÂ 40% of striatal MSNs expressing both DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA.[19][25][26]  These mixed-type NAcc MSNs with both D1-type and D2-type receptors are mostly confined to the NAcc shell.[19] The neurons in the shell, as compared to the core, have a lower density of dendritic spines, less terminal segments, and less branch segments than those in the core. The shell neurons project to the subcommissural part of the ventral pallidum as well as the ventral tegmental area and to extensive areas in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala.[27][28][29]
