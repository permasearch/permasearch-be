After the 1998 film, the show began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some longtime fans became alienated during the show's sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles.[254] Rather than adhering to the "Monsters-of-the-Week" style, they were often romantic or humorous or both, such as "Arcadia" or "Terms of Endearment". Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was "making it all up as he goes along".[254] As for the seventh season, The A.V. Club noted that while most of the first eight seasons of The X-Files was "good-to-great", the seventh season of the show was "flagging" and possessed "significant problems".[255] Despite this, seasons six and seven included several episodes that were lauded by critics, including the sixth season entries "Triangle" and "The Unnatural",[256][257] as well as the seventh season installment "X-Cops".[258]
