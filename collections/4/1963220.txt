Catalán rode on horseback for many hours westwards to bring help. During the trip he saw another arriero on the south side of Río Azufre, and asked him to reach the boys and to bring them to Los Maitenes. Then, he followed the river to its intersection with the Río Tinguiririca, where after passing a bridge he was able to reach the narrow route that linked the village of Puente Negro to the holiday resort of Termas del Flaco. Here, he was able to stop a truck and reach the police station at Puente Negro, where the news was finally dispatched to the Army command in San Fernando, Chile and then to Santiago. Meanwhile, Parrado and Canessa were rescued and reached Los Maitenes, where they were fed and allowed to rest.
