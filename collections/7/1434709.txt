David Silverman, who directed the movie and various episodes of the series, joked that Springfield is located in the fictional state of "North Takoma".[14][15] This is substantiated by the state abbreviations NT and TA used within the show.[15][16] The telephone area codes for Springfield are 636 (St. Charles County and Western St. Louis County, Missouri)[17] and 939 (Puerto Rico).
