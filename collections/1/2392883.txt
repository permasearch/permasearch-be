Hearing audiences gave supportive reviews for the NTD performances from the start and throughout the history of the NTD, while D/deaf and Hard of Hearing (HH) audiences had mixed reviews for the work of the NTD. D/deaf and HH audience members expected performances to be focused more around the deaf experience, and they expected ASL to be more ‘realistic’ and less theatricalized. Some D/deaf viewed NTD performances to be an attempt to cater toward Hearing audiences which was not well received. Throughout the years, many D/deaf have come to appreciate the work of NTD.
