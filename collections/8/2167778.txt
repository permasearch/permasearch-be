The Fit's central fuel tank location under the front rather than rear seats — combined with a compact, semi-independent, H-shaped[12] torsion beam rear suspension — allows for a lower load platform and increased cargo volume.[13] Noted for its "class leading utilization of interior space and maximum flexibility for people or cargo,"[12] the Fit offered approximately twice the storage space behind its rear seat compared with the Toyota Yaris hatchback.[14]
