Three more long passes brought the Bulldogs all the way to the 8 yard line with the clock winding down. With 9 seconds to play, an Aaron Murray pass toward the end zone was deflected toward Chris Conley in the field of play. Surprised to see the ball—he was not the intended receiver on the play—Conley caught the pass as he fell at the 5 yard line.[3] The clock ran out before Georgia could run another play.
