From 1909 to 1929, the university held a ban against fraternities and sororities, since Henry Marshall Tory, the first president of the university, ordered all secret societies, including Upsilon Upsilon and Pi Sigma Phi, to be disbanded.[115] The drive to remove the ban begun in 1927, when students had formed the Athenian Club to lobby the university. During the same year, several men had formed the Rocky Mountain Goat Club, which was only official sanctioned due to the lack of any secret rituals or a written constitution.[115] The ban on fraternities and sororities would end in 1929, with the departure of President Tory. Members of the Rocky Mountain Goat Club had later formed the nucleus of the university's first fraternities.[115] The first fraternity was official recognized and chartered in 1930.[116] Fraternities and sororities are recognized as student groups by the university and Students' Union and are supported by local alumni advisors, their international headquarters, and a fraternity and sorority advisor in the Office of the Dean of Students. In addition, the fraternities are also governed by the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council.[116]
