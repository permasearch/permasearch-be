The Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there is no room for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (Ã  la fighting between Peter and The Giant Chicken) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, then end up in Kang and Kodos' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing "I will not think about Bart anymore" several times on a chalkboard.
