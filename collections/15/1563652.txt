On January 6, 2011, Durst attempted to get back in touch with Scantlin via a tweet on his official Twitter page, which read "Who knows Wes from puddle of mudd? I wanna connect [with] him again. Let me know."[46] Scantlin's reaction to this is not yet known, but both Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd played together on Epicenter 2011, along with another one of Durst's former proteges, Staind.
