Released early from prison for good behavior, Mott, now addicted to tranquilizer pills (“Miltowns”, later known as Quaaludes) returns to New York. He wanders around the city, finding that his family’s former apartment has become a small brothel, and visiting Pappas, who now works for the Reverend Gurrey. Pappas has gotten Gurrey to back his scheme of a “Christian Aeronautical Mission” which involves using hot air balloons to drop Bibles behind the Iron Curtain. Ulla is also present, and after sleeping with Gurrey, tries to induce Mott to murder her by making anti-Semitic remarks and (falsely) telling him that she was a guard at the Ravensbrück concentration camp, but he does not.
