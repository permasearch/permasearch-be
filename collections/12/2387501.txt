In the middle 1980s, having already achieved a high level of international prominence, Spanish singer Julio Iglesias was seeking to gain a foothold in American music; to this end, he had learned English. On his album 1100 Bel Air Place, he had already recorded a cover version of "The Air That I Breathe" in duet partnership with the Beach Boys and an original selection, "To All The Girls I've Loved Before," in duet partnership with Willie Nelson. Richard Perry, the album's music producer, suggested the idea of Iglesias having Diana Ross as yet another duet partner, and Iglesias agreed.
