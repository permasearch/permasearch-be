Some[by whom?] think that the ABC islands were first explored by one of Christopher Columbus' captains, Alonso de Ojeda, who landed on CuraÃ§ao in 1499. He is said to have called the islands Las islas de los Gigantes or Islands of the Giants due to the native inhabitants, the Caiquetio Indians. The first known European exploration was by Amerigo Vespucci, whose cartographer Juan de la Cosa first described the islands. The first Spanish colonists, unable to find any gold or silver, kidnapped most of the natives to work on plantations on the island of Hispaniola.[citation needed] By 1527 the Spanish had formed a government and established Catholicism on the islands.
