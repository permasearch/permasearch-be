Mike Peterson (portrayed by J. August Richards) is an ordinary man that was artificially enhanced with the Extremis-containing Centipede serum by Project Centipede. Peterson later joins S.H.I.E.L.D, but is caught in an explosion and awakens without his right leg and under the control of the "Clairvoyant", who gives him a bionic prosthetic limb as part of "Project Deathlok". After the defeat of Centipede and the "Clairvoyant", Peterson works for Coulson covertly, and aids in the take down of Hydra leader Dr. List. Peterson later returned with some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to help Phil Coulson seal the rift in the Lighthouse that was leaking different fears from it. Afterwards, he attended Fitz and Simmons' wedding.
