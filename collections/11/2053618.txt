Sylvester McMonkey McBean's Very Unusual Driving Machine was an attraction due to open with Islands of Adventure on May 28, 1999. It was to be a twin-track ride above Seuss Landing where guests would board individual cars which featured rider controlled speeds.[2] However, it was pushed back due to contractual disputes and safety issues. Although Universal very tentatively tried to set the ride's opening date for summer of 2001, the bankruptcy of the ride's original manufacturer, Severn Lamb,[3] postponed its opening indefinitely in 2002. As such, the original vehicles for the ride were removed, and replaced by Seuss characters on cars which would run along the track. In 2006, the ride and track were re-built and re-designed as The High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride.
