Integration of PYD into the juvenile justice system is informed by social learning theory and social control theory. Taken together, these theories suggest that “youth are less attracted to criminal behavior when they are involved with others, learning useful skills, being rewarded for using those skills, enjoying strong relationships and forming attachments, and earning the respect of their communities”.[37] This is in stark contrast to the theories of deterrence and retributive justice espoused by the current justice system.
