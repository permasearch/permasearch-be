Crash has quite a bad and short temper, this is due to his background and life before he lived in care. Crash's father was also very angry and short tempered after his wife (Crash's mother) left, and he took his anger out of Crash. He has quite a few close friends in the Dumping Ground. Crash was the first resident to make an effort in making friends with Jackie Hopper when she first arrived. Crash later became close friends with Tracy, Lol and Bouncer. He made his last appearance in 'The Wedding'.
