In 1904, women's golf and tennis were removed from the programme. The only women's event was archery, with only American athletes.[6] Six female athletes competed in St. Louis, 16 fewer than the 1900 games.[7] London 1908 had 37 female athletes who competed in archery, tennis and figure skating.[5] Stockholm 1912 featured 47 women and saw the addition of swimming and diving, as well as the removal of figure skating and archery. The 1916 Summer Games were due to be held in Berlin but were cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I.[8]
