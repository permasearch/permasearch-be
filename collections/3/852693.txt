In order to improve his short game, Gilmore seeks out Chubbs and the two head to a miniature golf course to practice putting. Gilmore improves and Chubbs presents Gilmore with a gift: his own original putter that he had used, modified to look like a hockey stick. Gilmore then reciprocates and presents Chubbs with a gift: the head of the alligator that bit his hand off. Chubbs is startled by the head and falls out an open window to his death.
