Immigration increased throughout the latter half of the 19th century. Starting with refugees from the Irish potato famine in the 1840s, New York became a prominent entry point for those seeking a new life in the United States.[38] Between 1855 and 1890, an estimated 8 million immigrants passed through Castle Clinton at Battery Park in Manhattan.[40][Note 5] Early in this period, most immigrants came from Ireland and Germany. Ellis Island opened in 1892,[40] and between 1880 and 1920, most immigrants were German and Eastern European Jews, Poles, and other eastern and southern Europeans, including many Italians. By 1925, New York City's population outnumbered that of London, making it the most populous city in the world.[38] Arguably New York's most identifiable symbol, Liberty Enlightening the World (the Statue of Liberty), a gift from France for the American centennial, was completed in 1886. By the early 20th century, the statue was regarded as the "Mother of Exiles"â€”a symbol of hope to immigrants.[42]
