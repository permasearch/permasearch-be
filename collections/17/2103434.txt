Stampp's main thrust was to counter the arguments of prior historians who had characterized slavery generally as a benign, paternalistic tradition, helpful in many ways to the slaves, which encouraged racial harmony in the Southern states.  Stampp also characterizes some critics of slavery[who?] for claiming that "to the Negroes, slavery seemed natural; knowing no other life, they accepted it without giving the matter much thought. Not that slavery was a good thing, mind youâ€”but still, it probably hurt the Negroes less than the it did the whites. Indeed, the whites were really more enslaved than were the Negro slaves" (429).  Stampp condemns such an argument and likens it to pro-slavery arguments before the Civil War, which were "based on some obscure and baffling logic" (429).
