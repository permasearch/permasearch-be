Newport News Shipbuilding used a full-scale three-dimensional product model developed in Dassault SystÃ¨mes CATIA V5 release 8 (which includes special features useful to shipbuilders[44]) to design and plan the construction of the Ford class of aircraft carriers. This enables engineers and designers to test visual integration in design, engineering, planning and construction of components and subsystems. CVN-78 is the first aircraft carrier to be designed in a full-scale 3D product model. This modeling enabled the rooms within the ship to be modular, so that future upgrades can be implemented by designers simply by swapping a box in and locking it down.
