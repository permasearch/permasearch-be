Aware of how expensive the cost of the music would be in the film, Berlanti made the decision to end shooting two days early. Of the decision, he said "I did know that a lot of the film was made in homage to movies that had these great soundtracks that, at my age, youâ€™d play the cassette tape over and over again until it would wear out. The soundtrack was the thing that kept you feeling the emotions of the movie. So it was always on my wish list to have a soundtrack that was reflective of that. It was very expensive so everyone wanted to make sure I was doing the right thing. I wanted more money to be put into the music."[8]
