In June 1994, a deer from a nearby forest strayed onto the track and was hit in a collision with the train. A 12-year-old boy was taken to the hospital as a result of the accident.[1] In September 2014, another collision with a deer on the track occurred. No riders were injured, but the deer was killed instantly. Park officials stated that although the perimeter is fenced off, animals such as deer occasionally get in.[2]
