In the 1960s, educator J. Chalmers Doane dramatically changed school music programs across Canada, using the ukulele as an inexpensive and practical teaching instrument to foster musical literacy in the classroom.[12] 50,000 schoolchildren and adults learned ukulele through the Doane program at its peak.[13] Today, a revised program created by James Hill and J. Chalmers Doane continues to be a staple of music education in Canada.
