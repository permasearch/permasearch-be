Nevada is the leading gold-producing state in the nation, in 2015 producing 5,339,659 ounces (166.1 tonnes), representing 78% of US gold and 5.4% of the world's production. Much of the gold in Nevada comes from large open pit mining and with heap leaching recovery. A number of major mining companies, including Newmont Mining, Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold, operate gold mines in the state. Active major mines include Cortez, Twin Creeks, Betz-Post, Jerritt Canyon and Getchell.[4][31]
