On 11 September 2010, the annual Dartmoor Yomp was re-routed to allow filming to continue undisturbed.[64] Spielberg praised the Dartmoor countryside's beauty: "I have never before, in my long and eclectic career, been gifted with such an abundance of natural beauty as I experienced filming War Horse on Dartmoorâ€¦ And, with two-and-a-half weeks of extensive coverage of landscapes and skies, I hardly scratched the surface of the visual opportunities that were offered to me."[65] Spielberg felt that the landscape was very much a character in the film.[66]
