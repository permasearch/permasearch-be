With the TouchWiz interface that the Samsung Behold has, it allows for little personalization options for the home screen such as the limited wallpapers options and no screen savers but it does allow for using a photo that is taken with the camera on the Samsung Behold as the wallpaper. Also, the Behold's phonebook only allows the user to search for contacts' names through first names which could be a hassle.
