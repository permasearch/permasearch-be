This was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving body piercing. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.
