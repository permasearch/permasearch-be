The International Day for Protection of Children is observed in many countries as Children's Day on 1 June since 1950. It was established by the Women's International Democratic Federation on its congress in Moscow (4 November 1949).[citation needed] Major global variants include a Universal Children's Holiday on 20 November, by United Nations recommendation.[7]
