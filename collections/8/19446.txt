Papa Nichols (Vernon Roberts) is Josh's great-grandfather and Walter's grandfather. In his only appearance in "The Demonator", he had surgery and said he fought in World War II. Walter tells Drake and Josh that they are not allowed to ride The Demonator roller coaster and he and Audrey tell the boys to stay home and watch Papa Nichols. Meanwhile, Drake lets Craig and Eric come over and watch him while the boys and Megan go to Mystic Mountain to ride the Demonator, but when he wakes up disoriented, he thinks he is back in the war and attacks them, thinking they are Germans (whom he called "German Nerds"). At the end of The Demonator, Walter tries to wake him up and he punches him when he called him a "German." He is later mentioned once by Josh in "The Wedding".
