April has been designated Child Abuse Prevention Month in the United States since 1983.[143] U.S. President Barack Obama continued that tradition by declaring April 2009 Child Abuse Prevention Month.[144] One way the Federal government of the United States provides funding for child-abuse prevention is through Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP).[145]
