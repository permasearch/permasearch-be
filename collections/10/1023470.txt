As a child, Sarah was not only aware of her father's activities, but actively participated in them. One of their scams was the "Lichtenstein," in which her father would masquerade as a struggling German inventor or businessman attempting to unload an invention or other valuable commodity that never actually existed.[8] Christmases were spent scamming the Salvation Army.[9] "Chuck Versus the Wedding Planner" reveals that Sarah spent at least some of the ten years between 1988 and 1998 in the care of her grandmother, who did not think much of her father.
