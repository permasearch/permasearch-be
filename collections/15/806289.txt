There are almost half a million (451,000) students enrolled in electronics engineering programs[155] with an additional 114,000 electronics engineers entering the Mexican workforce each year[109] and Mexico had over half a million (580,000) certified electronic engineering professionals employed in 2007.[111] From the late 1990s, the Mexican electronics industry began to shift away from simple line assembly to more advanced work such as research, design, and the manufacture of advanced electronics systems such as LCD panels, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, microelectronics, microprocessors, chipsets and heavy electronic industrial equipment and in 2006 the number of certified engineers being graduated annually in Mexico surpassed that of the United States.[156] Many Korean, Japanese and American appliances sold in the US are actually of Mexican design and origin but sold under the OEM's client names.[157][158] In 2008 one out of every four consumer appliances sold in the United States was of Mexican design.[159]
