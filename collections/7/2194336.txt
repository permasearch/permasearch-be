Then Durai Singam finds out about Thangaraj and Bhai's partnership. He plans to arrest Saghayam first, gathering evidence while Saghayam is out to sea, and waits to arrest him at the harbour. But Saghayam is bringing Danny with him to attend Thangaraj's new hotel's party. Sagyam is arrested by plan, and Durai Singam arrest Danny without knowing his identity, but due to lack of visa. Thangaraj tries multiple power levels to make Durai Singam release the duo, but it is not of any use. Finally they take Durai Singam to his superior's office, and then break open his station to release Danny and Saghayam. Durai Singam finds that Danny has escaped, the police station in ruins, and his fellow officers injured. All of Durai Singam's effort is spoiled due to  his superior and the next morning he is suspended for unruly behaviour. Though without power, he warns Bhai that he knows about Danny and will return soon.
