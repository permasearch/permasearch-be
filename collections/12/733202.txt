Several agencies offer discounted tolls to E-ZPass customers. The details vary widely, and can include general discounts for all Eâ€‘ZPass users, variable pricing discounts for off-peak hours, commuter plans with minimum usage levels, flat rate plans offering unlimited use for a period of time, carpool plans for high-occupancy vehicles, and resident plans for those living near particular toll facilities. Many of these plans are available only to customers whose tags are issued by the agency that owns the toll facility in question (reciprocity applies to tag acceptance, not to discounts). Eight authorities in the Northeast (Maine,[54] the Massachusetts Turnpike,[55] the New Hampshire Turnpike,[56] Rhode Island,[57] the NYC TBTA,[58] the New Jersey Turnpike,[59] DelDOT[60]) and Maryland restrict their general discounts to their own respective tagholders. The Delaware Memorial Bridge restricts its discount plans to New Jersey tags[61] despite its toll plaza being located in Delaware (DelDOT-issued tags cannot obtain the discount plans).[62]
