The size of Mexico City's population and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials as well as modern scholars. There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that was a factor in the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire, but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period. There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy Revillagigedo in 1790.[54] In 1689, there was an estimate of 57,000 residents.[55] An estimate for 1753 based on a partial census mandated by the Audiencia put the population at 70,000.[56] In the period between 1689 and 1753, there were at least nine epidemics.[57] The Revillagigedo census of 1790 counts 112,926 residents, a significant increase.[58] This might be due to migration to the city accelerating. An 1811 census done by the ‘’Juzgado de Policía’’ put the number even higher, at 168,811, which might well reflect displacement from the countryside from the insurgency of Miguel Hidalgo and his successors.[59] The census of 1813 done by the city government (Ayuntamiento) shows a significant decrease to 123,907, perhaps showing the return of short-term migrants to their home communities following the waning of the insurgency, but also possibly “fevers” that affected the population.[60][61]
