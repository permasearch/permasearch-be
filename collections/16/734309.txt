Because of the rendition by Elvis Presley (with backing by the Jordanaires on his first Christmas album) in 1957, as well as what followed after his singing the song immediately after his requesting those watching his third and final appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, on January 6 of that year, to send emergency aid for some 250,000 refugees fleeing Hungary after the late October of 1956 double invasion of that country by the then Soviet Union, the song, which in addition Elvis dedicated to the refugees as the show's finale and to a television audience estimated at 50 million, yielded over the next 11 months contributions amounting to US$6 million, or the equivalent of US$49.5 in 2017 dollars.
