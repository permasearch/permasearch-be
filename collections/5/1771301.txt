Kadane's algorithm begins with a simple inductive question: if we know the maximum subarray sum ending at position     i   {\displaystyle i}   (call this      B  i     {\displaystyle B_{i}}  ), what is the maximum subarray sum ending at position     i + 1   {\displaystyle i+1}   (equivalently, what is      B  i + 1     {\displaystyle B_{i+1}}  )? The answer turns out to be relatively straightforward: either the maximum subarray sum ending at position     i + 1   {\displaystyle i+1}   includes the maximum subarray sum ending at position     i   {\displaystyle i}   as a prefix, or it doesn't (equivalently,      B  i + 1   = m a x (  A  i + 1   ,  A  i + 1   +  B  i   )   {\displaystyle B_{i+1}=max(A_{i+1},A_{i+1}+B_{i})}  , where      A  i + 1     {\displaystyle A_{i+1}}   is the element at index     i + 1   {\displaystyle i+1}  ).
