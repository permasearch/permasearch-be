Current training procedures for Hazard Communication in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.[according to whom?] Therefore, educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures will represent the greatest training challenge.  Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace.  Employees and emergency responders will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if products are imported from countries that implement GHS prior to the United States and Canada, employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.
