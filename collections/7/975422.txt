Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th century BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property.[18][19] By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women.[20] Spartan women controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army.[18] Girls as well as boys received an education.[18][21] But despite relatively greater freedom of movement for Spartan women, their role in politics was just as the same as Athenian women.[17]
