The size of brown bears is the most variable of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, and most accepted races vary widely in size. This is in part due to sexual dimorphism, as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most races. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation. Therefore, a bear may need to be weighed in both spring and fall to get an idea of its mean annual weight.[93][94]
