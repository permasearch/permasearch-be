The largest crowd at Parramatta Stadium under the current configuration was 21,141 in 2006 against the Wests Tigers.[32] The largest ever attendance for a Parramatta Eels home game came in the stadium’s first season when 27,243 saw the Eels draw 12-all with South Sydney in Round 24 of the 1986 NSWRL season. The largest ever rugby league attendance at Parramatta Stadium was set on 6 July 1994 when 27,918 saw Australia defeat France 58-0 in a one-off mid-season Test match.
