Republic Airlines began hub operations in 1984, and its merger with Northwest Airlines in 1986 expanded the hub. Transpacific flights began in 1987, nonstop Northwest 747s to Tokyo. The last of Metro's six runways (4L/22R) was completed in December 2001 in preparation for the opening of the mile-long, 122-gate, $1.2 billion McNamara Terminal in the airport midfield in 2002.[15] The airport remained a hub for Northwest Airlines until it merged with Delta Air Lines.[16]
