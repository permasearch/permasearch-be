On January 8, 2014, Petrino was hired to his former position of head coach at Louisville in place of Charlie Strong, who moved to replace Mack Brown at Texas.[89] Brohm was named as a candidate to become head coach later that same day.[90] On January 10, 2014, Brohm was officially named the head coach of the Hilltoppers.[91] On August 29, 2014, his Hilltoppers opened the season with a 59–31 win over the Bowling Green Falcons, scoring more points than during any game in the 2013 season. The team broke school records for total yards in a game (702) and most points scored since moving to the FBS level. Doughty also set three individual records.[92] The following week Brohm suffered his first defeat as a head coach, losing 42-34 to Illinois.[93] After losing 5 out of his first 8 games as a head coach (four of which were by a single possession), the Hilltoppers rallied to win their last four regular season games. This included a win over undefeated #19 Marshall 67-66 in overtime, again breaking the school record for points in an FBS game for the third time of the season.[94] The Hilltoppers 7–5 regular season earned them a berth in the 2014 Bahamas Bowl where they played Central Michigan Chippewas.[95] Leading 49-14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Chippewas rallied to be down 1-point, but their failed two-point conversion with no time left led to a Hilltoppers victory.[96]
