Though the Atomium depicts an iron unit cell, the balls were originally clad with aluminium. Following the 2004â€“2007 renovations, however, the aluminium was replaced with stainless steel, which is primarily iron. Likewise, while the subject of Atomium was chosen to depict the enthusiasm of the Atomic Age, iron is not and cannot be used as fuel in nuclear reactions.
