In the late 80s, several researchers advocated a completely new approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics.[130] They believed that, to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body â€” it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. They argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill (see Moravec's paradox). They advocated building intelligence "from the bottom up."[131]
