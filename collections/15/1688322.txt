Qatar also has bilateral relationships with a variety of foreign powers. Qatar hosts the Al Udeid Air Base, a joint U.S.-British base, which acts as the hub for all American and British air operations in the Persian Gulf.[140] It has allowed American and British forces to use an air base to send supplies to Iraq and Afghanistan.[141]  According to leaked documents published in The New York Times, Qatar's record of counter-terrorism efforts was the "worst in the region".[142] The cable suggested that Qatar's security service was "hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals".[142]
