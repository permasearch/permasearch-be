The frontovik usually carried all he had in a simple bag.[107] Most of the frontovik had a perevgzochnii paket (wound dressing packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very lucky to have a towel and toothbrush.[108] Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were extremely rare.[108] Usually sticks with chewed ends were used for brushing teeth.[108] To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army.[109] Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter.[109] Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942.[109] The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats).[110] The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).”.[110] Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha” (“schchi and kasha, that's our fare.”).[110] Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka.[111] Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.[111]
