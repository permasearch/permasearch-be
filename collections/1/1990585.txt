Overall, the introduction of characters from Mayberry and the similarities in character gave the appearance that the show was an alternate version of Griffith's earlier show, only with some names and details changed, creating confusion. Griffith also blamed the bad reputation of Headmaster for making it more difficult for The New Andy Griffith Show to succeed.[citation needed] Coincidentally, CBS had a public desire to overhaul its image to appeal to wealthier, more sophisticated audiences, which left the network less eager to promote rural sitcoms that previously had been a network staple.[3]
