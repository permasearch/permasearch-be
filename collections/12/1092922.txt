On June 29, 2012, the Supreme Court declined an FCC appeal. The FCC was attempting to reinstate the government's fine of US$550,000 which was overturned by the lower court based on FCC rules that were in place at the time of the broadcast, which were later changed. Chief Justice John Roberts said "It is now clear that the brevity of an indecent broadcast – be it word or image – cannot immunize it from FCC censure...Any future 'wardrobe malfunctions' will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below."[6]
