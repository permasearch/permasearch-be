In Britain, teenagers first came to public attention during the Second World War, when there were fears of juvenile delinquency.[193] By the 1950s, the media presented teenagers in terms of generational rebellion. The exaggerated moral panic among politicians and the older generation was typically belied by the growth in intergenerational cooperation between parents and children. Many working-class parents, enjoying newfound economic security, eagerly took the opportunity to encourage their teens to enjoy more adventurous lives.[194] Schools were falsely portrayed as dangerous blackboard jungles under the control of rowdy kids.[195] The media distortions of the teens as too affluent, and as promiscuous, delinquent, counter-cultural rebels do not reflect the actual experiences of ordinary young adults, particularly young women.[196]
