The townspeople, especially the police officers, are upset over the billboards' content, including Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). Many people also find the signs in bad taste considering that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer. Soon after the billboards are put up, Mildred and her depressed son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) are harassed and threatened, but Mildred stays firm, much to Robbie's chagrin.
