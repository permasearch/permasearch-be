In 1936, Orson Welles produced his black Macbeth at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem.[50] Grand theaters from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were torn down or converted to churches. Harlem lacked any permanent performance space until the creation of the Gatehouse Theater in an old Croton aqueduct building on 135th Street in 2006.[51]
