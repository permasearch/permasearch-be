Edward Winter's first appearance on M*A*S*H is in the second-season episode "Deal Me Out", in which he plays a CID captain named Halloran, and is listed in the credits as such. In the fourth-season episode "Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"—the next episode in which both Flagg and Sidney Freedman appear—Flagg greets Sidney with the statement "We played poker once," to which Sidney replies, "Oh sure; with Intelligence, right?" M*A*S*H often used recurring actors to portray different characters (Including Dick O'Neill, Tim O'Connor, Ted Gehring, and numerous Asian-American actors), however, the example of Capt. Halloran can be explained as one of Flagg's many aliases.
