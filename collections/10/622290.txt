Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is located on the mainland of the United States. Its official name is State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which is derived from the merger of four Colonial settlements. The settlements of Newport and Portsmouth were situated on what is commonly called Aquidneck Island today, but it was called Rhode Island in Colonial times.[17][18] Providence Plantation was the name of the colony founded by Roger Williams in the area now known as the city of Providence.[19] This was adjoined by the settlement of Warwick; hence the plural Providence Plantations.
