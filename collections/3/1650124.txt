IRC is an open protocol that uses TCP[1] and, optionally, TLS. An IRC server can connect to other IRC servers to expand the IRC network.[19] Users access IRC networks by connecting a client to a server.[20] There are many client implementations, such as mIRC, HexChat and irssi, and server implementations, e.g. the original IRCd. Most IRC servers do not require users to register an account but a nick (nickname) is required before being connected.[21]
