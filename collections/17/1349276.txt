In January 2009, a snowy owl appeared in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting in the state since 1987.[11] Also notable is the mass southern migration in the winter of 2011/2012, when thousands of snowy owls were spotted in various locations across the United States.[12] This was then followed by an even larger mass southern migration in 2013/2014 with the first snowy owls seen in Florida for decades.[13][14]
