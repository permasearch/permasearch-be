The following off-season proved to be very busy for the Nets. On June 26, 2008, Richard Jefferson was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons.[31] Jefferson's departure, along with that of Jason Kidd earlier that year, marked the beginning of a new era in the Garden State. The Nets signed draftees Brook Lopez and Ryan Anderson,[32] along with Chris Douglas-Roberts.[32] The Nets filled out their youthful roster by signing veterans Eduardo Nájera and Jarvis Hayes, and trading for Orlando point guard Keyon Dooling. The Nets finished the season with their second straight 34–48 record, tied for 11th in the Eastern Conference with the Milwaukee Bucks. Devin Harris made his first All-Star team and narrowly missed winning the NBA Most Improved Player award, and Brook Lopez finished third in Rookie of the Year voting.
