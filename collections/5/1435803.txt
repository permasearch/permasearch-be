The Edge itself is described as a vast outcropping into the sky, with a river pouring over the tip. The world is made up of a number of locations, which change over the course of the series. Notable locations include the twin cities of Undertown and Sanctaphrax, The Deepwoods, The Twilight Woods, The Mire, The Nightwoods, Riverrise, Great Glade, The Free Glades, Hive, The Edgelands and the Stone Gardens. It was thought that the Edge was endless but that was false in the recent books.
