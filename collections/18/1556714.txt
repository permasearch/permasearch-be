Two parallel investigations were led by the Dutch, one into the technical cause of the crash, and a separate criminal inquiry.[121] The technical report was released on 13 October 2015,[122] while the criminal investigation reported some of their findings in September 2016.[123][10] According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the country in which an aviation incident occurs is responsible for the investigation, but that country may delegate the investigation to another state; Ukraine has delegated the leadership of both investigations to the Netherlands.[124][125][126][127]
