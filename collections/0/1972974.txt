The animated show by Aaron McGruder, The Boondocks, had a character who Huey called the White Shadow. He claimed to be a government agent sent to spy on Huey, but was only ever seen by Huey causing Huey to believe he may just be a figment of his imagination. He only had 2 appearances, the first being in "The Real" and in the last episode of season 3 "It's Going Down".
