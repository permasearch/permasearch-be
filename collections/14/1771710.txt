Sargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks, or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.[13]   In tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids,  a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins occurs.[14]
