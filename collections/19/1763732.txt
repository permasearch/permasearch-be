Spencer wants to make Carly's birthday the best ever. Carly asks Spencer to get a haircut and Gibby's Grandfather, who is blind, does so, making his hair shorter. He then makes a gummmy bear lamp and puts it in Carly's room which later sets Carly's room on fire. However Spencer receives $82,000 in an insurance settlement after hearing their great-grandmother's expensive diamond encrusted bezel watch is destroyed. Spencer makes Carly get a job at the groovy smoothie while He, Sam, Freddie, Gibby and a bunch of workers, engineers and technologists work to put a new room for Carly. Things in the new room include a make up station an computerized wardrobe and a gummy bear Chandelier (made from fire proof gummy bears).
