Oil heaters consist of metal columns with cavities, inside which a heat transfer oil flows freely around the heater. A heating element at the base of the heater heats up the oil, which then flows around the cavities of the heater by convection. The oil has a relatively high specific heat capacity and high boiling point. The high specific heat capacity allows the oil to effectively transfer thermal energy from the heating element, while the oil's high boiling point allows it to remain in the liquid phase for the purpose of heating, so that the heater does not have to be a high pressure vessel.
