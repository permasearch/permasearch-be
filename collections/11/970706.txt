In the centre the newly-born goddess Venus stands nude in a giant scallop shell.  Its size is purely imaginary, and is also found in classical depictions of the subject.[3]  At the left the wind god Zephyr blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth.  He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings.  Vasari was probably correct in identifying her as "Aura", personification of a lighter breeze.[4]  Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.[5]
