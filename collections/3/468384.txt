Tampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their second season, starting with a record of 0–26 (though the Bucs had beaten the Atlanta Falcons 17–3 in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).[10] Until the Detroit Lions in 2008, the 1976 Bucs were the worst team in NFL history. Their losing streak caused them to become the butt of late-night television comedians' jokes.[11] Their first win came in December 1977, on the road against the New Orleans Saints. The Saints' head coach Hank Stram was fired after losing to the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay only needed one more week to get their second victory, a home win over the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1977 season finale. The Cardinals also fired their coach, Don Coryell, shortly afterward.[12] The team continued to improve in 1978, although injuries to several key players kept the team from achieving the winning record promised by McKay.[13]
