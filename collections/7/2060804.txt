Schrader acknowledges that Pickpocket (1959) by the French director Robert Bresson was a direct influence on the film;[14][15] the composition of the final shot draws heavily from the film,[16][17] as does the final dialogue.[18] Schrader later provided an introduction to the Criterion Collection DVD of Pickpocket. Schrader re-visited many of the themes of American Gigolo in his 2007 film, The Walker,[19] and says the idea for that film came about while wondering what would have become of the Julian Kaye character.[20]
