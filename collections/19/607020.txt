The game's development began after Super Mario 3D World released in late 2013, and was created by the same development team.[9][22] Under director Kenta Motokura, the team experimented to find fun concepts based on the series' "theme of surprise". For example, the team found that throwing a hat was the most pleasing action to perform with the Joy-Con controller, resulting in the hat "capture" game mechanic.[9] The brainstorm resulted in a large number of eccentric prototypes,[9][23] and the developers sought to incorporate them by orienting the game as a series of dense, sandbox environments.[9] This led to the game's varied Kingdom environments, each with unique game mechanics.[23] The developers prioritized the city environment when selecting which environments to represent in Odyssey. They wanted a familiar aspect from the series to anchor players in the novel setting, and so chose Pauline, a character who first appeared alongside Mario in Donkey Kong, to be the mayor of the world known as New Donk City. Some of Mario's in-game costume options reference his various prior appearances in other games of the series, such as Mario's Picross and Super Mario Maker.[24][25]
