It was rumored that the Cell processors in the third-generation PS3s (40 GB, 2008 80 GB (CECHL,CECHM,CECHK) and 160 GB) would move from a 90 nm process to the newer 65 nm process,[22] which SCEI CEO Kaz Hirai later confirmed,[23] and later to 45 nm. This change lowers the power consumption of the console and makes it less expensive to produce.[24]
