Idaho has state preemption of firearms laws, local units of government cannot regulate the ownership, possession, use, transportation, or carry of firearms, firearm components or ammunition. The state constitution states that "No law shall impose licensure, registration or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition. Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms, except those actually used in the commission of a felony."[11][12]
