FreeCell is a solitaire card game played using the standard 52-card deck. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few deals are unsolvable,[1] and all cards are dealt face-up from the very beginning of the game.[2] Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the seed value used by the random number generator to shuffle the cards).[2]
