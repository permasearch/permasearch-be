The series of escalating complications begins when a member of the Royal Guard unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate the Russian ambassador, Irina Sidorova. Then a Russian agent is the victim of a hit-and-run and the Russian government demands that Norway extrajudicially extradite the driver, a suspected Chechen terrorist. The hit-and-run was an accident rather than a deliberate attack, but the driver commits suicide rather than being transferred to Russia. An insurgent group, Fritt Norge (Free Norway), emerges, and attacks police headquarters. The Russian government takes this as an excuse to prolong their occupation of Norway. A gas production facility is attacked, temporarily delaying the EU production target, and killing many Russian workers. Tensions further increase as unexplained events occur at the Norwegianâ€“Russian border and a Russian naval fleet exercises off the coast of northern Norway. Berg asks the EU to protect Norway's sovereignty, but the EU fails to act decisively.
