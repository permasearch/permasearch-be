Marx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The memorial at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956,[196] bears the carved message: "WORKERS OF ALL LANDS UNITE", the final line of The Communist Manifesto; and from the 11th "Thesis on Feuerbach" (edited by Engels): "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various waysâ€”the point however is to change it".[197] The Communist Party of Great Britain had the monument with a portrait bust by Laurence Bradshaw erected and Marx's original tomb had only humble adornment.[197] In 1970, there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.[198]
