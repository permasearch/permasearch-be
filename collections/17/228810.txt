The islands first collectively identified as the Prettanic or Brettanic Islands (Βρεττανικαὶ νῆσοι) or as αἱ Βρεττανιαι (literally "the Britains") were peopled by tribes the ancient Greeks called the Πρεττανοί, later Bρεττανοί. These islands included Ierne (Ireland) inhabited by the "Hiberni", and the larger insula Albionum, "island of the Albions", which was later named Great Britain after the Roman province of Britannia.[6]
