The Doctor learns from the Ood that the Master (John Simm) will be returning soon. A cult of the Master has resurrected him using the ring dropped at the end of "Last of the Time Lords", but Lucy Saxon sabotages the process, causing the Master to experience intense hunger and energy expenditure, which also gives him powers beyond those of other Time Lords. In his investigations, the Doctor meets up with Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) and they both travel to the Naismith Institute where they have enlisted to repair an alien "Immortality Gate". However, the Master uses the gate to re-write the DNA of all humans on the planet with his own, creating a planet of Masters. Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) and Wilf are shielded from this. Far across the universe, Rassilon (Timothy Dalton) heralds the return of Gallifrey and the end of time itself.
