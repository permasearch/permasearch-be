In early 2012, Somers announced that Somers Carroll Productions had approached other commercial networks in hope for Hey Hey's return but were unsuccessful despite their best efforts.[18] It has been reported[who?] that Somers Carroll Productions are now looking into stage shows instead. To date, there has been no news of another season. However, in December 2015, Somers announced that he was still in talks regarding Hey Hey returning "whether it be one or two shows or whatever" in a Christmas video message uploaded to YouTube.[19]
