The piece can be sung to several melodies, in particular the 17th-century English melody "Royal Oak", adapted by Martin Shaw, and "All Things Bright and Beautiful" by William Henry Monk. There have also been other adaptations, such as a full choral piece by John Rutter.  In earlier editions of the Church of Scotland's Church Hymnary, the tunes "God in Nature" by John Stainer and "All Things Bright" by Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley had been used.
