Elections are administered locally: in each lower-tier local authority, the polling procedure is operated by the Acting Returning Officer or Returning Officer, and the compiling and maintenance of the electoral roll by the Electoral Registration Officer (except in Northern Ireland, where the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland assumes both responsibilities). The Electoral Commission sets standards for and issues guidelines to Returning Officers and Electoral Registration Officers, and is responsible for nationwide electoral administration (such as the registration of political parties and directing the administration of national referendums).[1]
