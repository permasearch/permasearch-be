Jackson Rathbone stars as Sokka in the feature film The Last Airbender. Unlike the show, Sokka is serious, with most of his immature and humorous qualities either toned down or removed altogether. Significant criticism was pointed at the character difference.[26] Rathbone received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his role in the film.
