A close friend of the Walton family and second cousin-in-law of John Walton Sr., Isaac B. "Ike" Godsey[6] (Joe Conley) is the proprietor of the General Mercantile, the postmaster, and only garage mechanic in Walton's Mountain until teenage Jim-Bob Walton opens a garage across the road from the Mercantile. He is a World War I veteran, having served alongside John Walton and Sheriff Bridges. During World War II, he serves as the town's Civil Defense warden. He offers the use of extra space in the Mercantile as a classroom when a fanatic burns down the schoolhouse. He eventually marries John's distant cousin Corabeth and they adopt a daughter, Aimee. Later on, Ike suffers a heart attack brought on by stress and is forced to limit his activities as shopkeeper. He is implied to pass away many years later when an older John-Boy remarks that "Ike's gone now."
