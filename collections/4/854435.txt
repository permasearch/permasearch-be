The film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, both directed by The Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released on separate dates in 2003.[141] The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army.[142][143] The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.[143][144]
