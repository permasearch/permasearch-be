Early on December 15, the system crossed west of 135°E and entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's (PAGASA) area of responsibility. Upon doing so, PAGASA began issuing advisories and assigned the cyclone with the local name Sendong.[6] Shortly thereafter, the storm passed close to or over Palau.[7] By 0600 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to tropical storm status, at which time they assigned it with the name Washi.[8] Maintaining a rapid westward track, Washi slowly became more organized, with low-level inflow improving during the latter part of December 15.[9] On December 16, Washi reached its peak strength as a severe tropical storm and made its first landfall along the east coast of Mindanao.
