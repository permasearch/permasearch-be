Bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and small doctorates in the form of shortcuts (Bc., Mgr., Ing., ...) are listed before name of person, Doctor degree (Ph.D.) is listed after name (e. g. MUDr. Jan NovÃ¡k, Ph.D.). Czechs are very proud of their academic degrees and titles therefore its omission is considered disrespectful.
