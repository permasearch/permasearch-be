Michael Christopher Kelso (born August 28, 1959), is a fictional character, known simply as Kelso by his friends, is one of the five male leads on Fox Network's That '70s Show, portrayed by Ashton Kutcher.[2] Tall, lanky and long-haired, Kelso had been accepted as the local idiot until he moved to Chicago for the eighth season.[3] His behavior is very much in line with a stereotypical oversexed lunkhead or a male-bimbo who gets through life on his good looks.[4][5] He spends most of the series in a mutually parasitic relationship with the equally vapid Jackie Burkhart, whom he continues to obsess over following their numerous breakups.[6][7][8]
