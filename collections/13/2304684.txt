In August 2014, Palicki joined Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in a recurring role as Barbara "Bobbi" Morse.[15] She became one of the principal cast after the midseason break of season 2,[16] continuing until her character was written out of the series near the end of season 3. ABC ordered a pilot episode for a spin-off, Marvel's Most Wanted, featuring her character in the lead role,[17] but did not develop it as a series.[18]
