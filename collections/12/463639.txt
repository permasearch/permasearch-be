During February to April 2005, DaimlerChrysler hosted a "What Can You HEMI?" contest promoting alternative uses of the HEMI engines. The top five finalists include HEMI Snowblower, HEMI-Go-Round carousel, HEMI on Ice ice resurfacer, HEMI-Shredder, HEMI Big Wheel, i.e. the child's tricycle of the 1970s.[36][37][38] The winner was the HEMI Big Wheel, which had a 5.7 L HEMI in the back that was installed backwards, thus reverse became the only forward gear. Plate steel was the predominant material, while a rolled tube of steel had to be utilized for the front tire as there were no such tires 4-foot (122Â cm) in diameter that were as narrow as needed for this project.[39]
