The song was released alongside the announcement of their spring 2018 tour dates.[13][14] Drummer Ashton Irwin said of the song in an interview with Beats 1: "'Want You Back' articulates the band we were, we are now, and what we're gonna be, that's why I like it and that's why we picked it. We also made it with close friends like we've got Andrew Goldstein who we literally see every week. We party together, we confess our sorrows and happiness. We speak to this man everyday."[15] The band told news.com.au that they are "super nervous" about this comeback song, which will introduce their third album.[16]
