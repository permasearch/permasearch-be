Stenberg identifies as non-binary,[29][30] and previously came out as bisexual;[18][31][32][33] however in an interview for Elle's September 2016 issue she was quoted as saying in part, "Bisexual is a word I am not too attached to [...] it implies a dichotomy that doesn't take into account trans people. So maybe pansexual is more accurate for me."[34]
