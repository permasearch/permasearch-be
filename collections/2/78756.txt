The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balanceâ€”that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 at the discretion of Congress,[58] thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The Wilmot Proviso announced this position in 1846.[59]
