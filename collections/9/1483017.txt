Flexible electronics are polymers or other flexible materials (e.g. silk,[154] pentacene, PDMS, parylene, polyimide[155]) that are printed with circuitry; the flexible nature of the organic background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the fabrication techniques utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).[156] Flexible electronics were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s.[157]
