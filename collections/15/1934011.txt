Point du Sable left Chicago in 1800. He sold his property to John Kinzie and moved to the Missouri River valley, at that time part of Spanish Louisiana. The reason for his departure is unknown.[46] In her 1852 memoir, Juliette Kinzie, Kinzie's daughter-in-law, suggested that "perhaps he was disgusted at not being elected to a similar dignity [great chief] by the Pottowattamies".[52] In 1874 Nehemiah Matson elaborated on this story, claiming that Point du Sable was a slave from Virginia who had moved with his master to Lexington, Kentucky, in 1790. According to Matson, Point du Sable became a zealous Catholic to convince a Jesuit missionary to declare him chief of the local Native Americans, and left Chicago when the natives refused to accept him as their chief.[53] Quaife dismisses both of these stories as being fictional.[11]
