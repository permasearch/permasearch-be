After an especially difficult winter in 1906, and years of hardship since the 1880s, the British government offered to evacuate the island.[14] Those remaining on Tristan held a meeting and decided to refuse, thus deepening the island's isolation. It was reported that no ships visited from 1909 until 1919, when HMS Yarmouth finally stopped to inform the islanders of the outcome of World War I.[14]
