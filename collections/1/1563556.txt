"My Life Would Suck Without You" was written by Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald, Max Martin and Claude Kelly, with additional uncredited songwriting by Kelly Clarkson.[5] Record executive Clive Davis hired Gottwald and Martin, who produced "Since U Been Gone" and "Behind These Hazel Eyes" for Clarkson in 2004, to produce a new song for Clarkson in 2008 after Clarkson's My December suffered poor commercial performance after refusing to hire them in 2006.[6] She was completely against it through the entire process due to previous bad experiences working with Dr. Luke, stating he's difficult to work with, demeaning and a liar, thus "making the artist look bad".[7] Clarkson eventually gave in claiming the label wouldn't put out her record otherwise.[8] Yet, she was unsatisfied with the original version of the song, which she says differed greatly from the final version and included lyrical references to marijuana, so the writers assisted her in making the song more personal to her and "better than it was," according to Clarkson.[9] After the song was finalized and significant changes to the lyrics had been made, Clarkson said RCA approached her about taking a proper writing credit for the track, which she refused in order to make a point to the label as they failed to meet her one request which was not to have her work with Luke again.[10]
