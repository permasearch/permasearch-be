Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Russian leaders. To help him, one of his patients, the Daily Telegraph editor Sir Colin Coote, arranged an introduction to Yevgeny Ivanov (anglicised as "Eugene"), listed as a naval attachÃ© at the Soviet Embassy.[25] British Intelligence (MI5) knew from the double-agent Oleg Penkovsky that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet GRU.[26] Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, where he met Keeler and Rice-Davies, and sometimes joined Ward's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.[20] MI5 considered Ivanov a potential defector, and sought Ward's help to this end, providing him with a case officer known as "Woods".[27][28] Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a backchannel, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union,[29] and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.[30] His closeness to Ivanov raised concerns about his loyalty; according to Lord Denning's September 1963 report, Ivanov often asked Ward questions about British foreign policy, and Ward did his best to provide answers.[20]
