Screenwriters Stephanie Counts and Shari Gold filed an 87-page lawsuit in January 2014, claiming that New Girl was based on their 2006 script for a proposed television series.[14] There were a number of similarities, including the number of roommates, similar backgrounds, appearance, and ethnicity.  Additionally, Jess's long term partner in the New Girl pilot had the same name (Spencer) and they broke up for similar reasons (partner's infidelity).  Fox and talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment LLC responded in April 2014 that in their view, the two works were not substantially similar and that any other similarities stemmed from non-protectable ideas, or scenes a faire. Thus, they pleaded that the judge dismiss the case.[15]  The case was dismissed with leave to amend in 2014.  An amended complaint was filed in 2014 and decided by summary judgment against Counts and Gold on December 30, 2015.[16]  In March, Counts and Gold were ordered to pay approximately $800,000 in attorney's fees.[17]
