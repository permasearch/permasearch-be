Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is the histrionic costar of TGS, and Liz's best friend. She is often shown as being extremely insecure about herself. A recurring motif in the show is Jenna's pursuit of fame through some ill-advised project ending up in public humiliation from which she never learns. She is, in other words, a typical prima donna. Off-camera she is comically conceited, frequently lying about her age and using her sexuality to manipulate men (almost always to bad effect).
