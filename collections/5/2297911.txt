The Waterman outboard engine appears to be the first gasoline-powered outboard offered for sale in significant numbers.[6] Developed by Cameron Waterman,[7] a young Yale Engineering student, it was developed from 1903, with a patent application filed in 1905[8] Starting in 1906,[9][10] the company went on to make thousands of his "Porto-Motor"[11] units,[12] claiming 25,000 sales by 1914.[13]  The inboard boat motor firm of Caille Motor Company of Detroit were instrumental in making the cylinder and engines.
