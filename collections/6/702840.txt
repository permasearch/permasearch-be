According to Japanese folklore, there is a darker side of pet spirituality in Shinto, known as the Inugami, which literally translates to dog god. Inugami are dark dangerous spirits which are conjured up through dark rituals involving the sacrifice of a common pet dog. In a way similar to shikigami, these rituals allow the dogâ€™s tortured spirit to be under the control of whomever summoned it. The Inugami can then be used by its owner to do their bidding and curse other people or even possess them and bring misfortune. The idea of this type of spirit could be linked to the fact that pets in Japanese culture were traditionally kept for utilitarian purposes as opposed to companionship.
