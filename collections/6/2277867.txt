Solomon is a Hebrew-derived surname and given name; Sol as a given name is usually a form of "Solomon". Its Aramaic form, Shlomo ܫܠܡܐ is related to the word shalom ("peace");[1] and is often chosen in part as a reference to the well-known King Solomon mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. (The Arabic name سليمان, Suleiman or Sulayman, also meaning "peace", is regarded as equivalent to Solomon, and the Islamic prophet Suleiman and King Solomon are generally regarded as accounts of the same person.)
