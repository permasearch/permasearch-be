The family's trek by wagon begins, with Addie's non-embalmed body in the coffin. Along the way, Anse and the five children encounter various difficulties.  Anse frequently rejects any offers of assistance, including meals or lodging, so at times the family goes hungry and sleeps in barns.  At other times he refuses to accept loans from people, claiming he wishes to "be beholden to no man", thus manipulating the would-be-lender into giving him charity as a gift not to be repaid.
