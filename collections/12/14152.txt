When asked in an August 2016 interview about Staind's future, Mushok stated that the hiatus could possibly be the end of the band. He explained, "I remember '09, we stopped touring, and we did a record after that. We did the self-titled Staind record, which we did a little touring on. It was one of my favorite Staind records we had done. Aaron, I know, has another country record coming out in September. So...you know, we say we're gonna do something else, but there's no real plan for it right now. I know he's pursuing. And I know we're writing another record.".[34] In addition, Aaron Lewis indicated that he is focused on country music while noting "Do I think there's room somewhere down the road for Staind to play shows in the summertime, radio festivals and stuff like that? Sure. Do I think I have another one of those Staind records in me? Of course I do. All I have to do is live."[35]
