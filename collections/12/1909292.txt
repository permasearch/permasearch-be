Iran's foreign supporters gradually came to include Syria and Libya, through which it obtained Scud missiles.[citation needed] It purchased weaponry from North Korea and the People's Republic of China, notably the Silkworm anti-ship missile.[citation needed] It also acquired arms from Portugal,[citation needed] notably after 1984. It also acquired propellants and other weapons related components from Spain and Portugal.[citation needed] The United States also provided covert support for Iran through Israel,[citation needed] although it is debated as to whether U.S. President Ronald Reagan actually ordered the sale of weapons to Iran.[citation needed] Most of this support included TOW missiles.
