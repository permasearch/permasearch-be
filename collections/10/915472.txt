Bruce Fery, CEO of The Grand America Hotel and Resorts and also a proponent of alcohol “normalization” in Utah, said, “From a guest service perspective, Utah’s liquor laws are really awkward and make us look like we are still in covered wagons. Utah’s liquor laws make us appear to be inhospitable.” He also cites many instances where out-of-towners were befuddled, put off, or downright angry at the policies that are in place to keep in accordance of the law.[32]
