After Obi-Wan defeats Vader in a lightsaber duel, he brings Padmé to the secret asteroid base Polis Massa. Despite efforts of medical droids, Padmé dies after delivering twins, Luke and Leia. Just prior to her death, Padmé insists to Obi-Wan that she knows "there is still good" in Anakin. After Padmé's body is altered to appear still pregnant and given an elaborate funeral ceremony on Naboo, her twins are separated to be hidden from Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine: Leia is adopted by Senator Organa and his wife Queen Organa on Alderaan to be raised as a princess, while Luke is brought to Tatooine to be raised by his step-grandfather's family, Owen and Beru Lars.
