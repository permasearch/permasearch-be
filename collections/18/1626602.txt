The first session was held on July 25, 1950 in the Jim Beck Studio in Dallas, Texas. There he recorded 4 songs, the first: I Love You a Thousand Ways, which was written by Lefty as a letter to his newly wed wife when he was jailed in 1947 for having sex with an underage girl. The next cut was If You've Got the Money, a jumping honky-tonk tune written by Frizzell and Frizzell's then manager and studio owner, Jim Beck. The songs were released together as a double-sided single on September 14, 1950.
