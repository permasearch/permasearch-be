The term ἐκκλησία appears in only two verses of the Gospels, in both cases in the Gospel of Matthew.[19] When Jesus says to Simon Peter, "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church",[21] the church is the community instituted by Christ, but in the other passage the church is the local community to which one belongs: "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."[22]
