Powertrain changes included a choice of the standard six-speed manual transmission or the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Engine choices include a 2.4-litre four-cylinder and a 3.5-litre V6 engine. The latter engine is also used in the Kia Sorento. Both engines generate greater power while obtaining greater fuel economy than previous engine models. Sales began in early January 2010.
