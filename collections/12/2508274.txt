Males and new queens take on their responsibilities in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense and the weight of the queen increases about 20%. Once the males and queen leave the nest, they do not return. In V. mandarinia, males wait outside the nest entrance until the queen emerges. Once the queen emerges, they attack her midair, bring her to the ground, and copulate from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the queen leaves. Many queens attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized. After this episode, queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats.
