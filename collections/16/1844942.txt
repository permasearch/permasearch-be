Traditionally known as Pherkad, Gamma Ursae Minoris has an apparent magnitude that varies between 3.04 and 3.09 roughly every 3.4 hours.[30] It and Kochab have been termed the "guardians of the pole star".[3] A white bright giant of spectral type A3II-III,[30] with around 4.8 times the Sun's mass, 1,050 times its luminosity and 15 times its radius,[31] it is 487±8 light-years distant from Earth.[26] Pherkad belongs to a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables[30]—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study asteroseismology.[32] Also possibly a member of this class is Zeta Ursae Minoris,[33] a white star of spectral type A3V,[34] which has begun cooling, expanding and brightening. It is likely to have been a B3 main-sequence star and is now slightly variable.[33] At magnitude 4.95 the dimmest of the seven stars of the Little Dipper is Eta Ursae Minoris.[35] A yellow-white main-sequence star of spectral type F5V, it is 97 light-years distant.[36] It is double the Sun's diameter, 1.4 times as massive, and shines with 7.4 times its luminosity.[35] Nearby Zeta lies 5.00-magnitude Theta Ursae Minoris. Located 860 ± 80 light-years distant,[37] it is an orange giant of spectral type K5III that has expanded and cooled off the main sequence, and has an estimated diameter around 4.8 times that of the Sun.[38]
