The first football team fielded by UCLA took the field in 1919.[4] The team was coached by Fred Cozens, and compiled a 2â€“6 record.[4] UCLA did not participate in an athletic conference until 1920, so the 1919 football team played a schedule full of local high schools and other assorted teams.[4] Cozens was UCLA's athletics director from 1919 to 1942.[5]
