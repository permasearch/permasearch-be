The Forest was shot mostly in the Belgian region of Wallonia[6] around Brussels, as well as Dinant, Namur, Rixensart and Court-Saint-Ã‰tienne. Filming also took place in France in the Ardennes, particularly around the River Meuse and communes of Haybes and Fumay. The final sequence was shot in Bray-Dunes near Dunkirk.[7]
