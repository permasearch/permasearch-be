She auditioned to revive her role from Young Frankenstein in the 2007 Broadway production opposite Megan Mullally (who replaced Kristin Chenoweth) and Roger Bart. However, Andrea Martin was cast instead. Brooks was quoted as saying that Leachman, at 81, was too old for the role. "We don't want her to die on stage," he told columnist Army Archerd, a statement to which Leachman took umbrage.[21] However, due to Leachman's success on Dancing with the Stars, Brooks reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau BlÃ¼cher in the Broadway production of Young Frankenstein after the departure of Beth Leavel, who had succeeded Martin.[22][23] The Broadway production closed before this could happen.
