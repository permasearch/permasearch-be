The historian Robert Rhodes James stated that Churchill had lived an "exceptionally long, complex, and controversial life", one which—in the realm of British parliamentary politics—was comparable only to Gladstone's in its "length, drama and incident".[630] Churchill's reputation among the general British public remains high: he was voted number one in a 2002 BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons of all time.[631] Throughout his career, Churchill's outspokenness earned him enemies,[75] and his legacy continues to stir intense debate among writers and historians.[1] By the time he entered the House of Commons as an MP, he was already controversial, perceived by many as "an adventurer and a medal-hunter".[632] Up until 1939, his approach to politics resulted in there developing a widespread "mistrust and dislike" of him,[630] an attitude exacerbated by his repeated party defections.[543] When First Lord of the Admiralty, many "critics denigrated him" as being "reckless, ignorant, and unprincipled, a political upstart with no understanding of the glorious traditions and methods of work of the Royal Navy".[633]
