Dishes served include palate cleansers made of vodka and green tea, frozen in liquid nitrogen,[18] a snail porridge that was described by one food critic as "infamous",[11] and ice creams of both crab, and egg and bacon, each of which resulted in increased media attention for the restaurant.[19] The mock turtle soup has an Alice in Wonderland theme, where a fob watch formed of freeze-dried beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a tea cup and has a beef stock "tea" poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch. A plate of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup. Toast sandwiches are served as a side dish.[20][21][22] It had been developed for an appearance on Heston's Feasts, and was afterwards added to the menu at the restaurant.[23] Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs, such as "Sounds of the Sea", a plate of seafood served with a seafood foam on top of a "beach" of tapioca, breadcrumbs and eel. Alongside the dish, diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat.[24] Other additional sensory components include "The smell of the Black Forest" that accompanies a kirsch ice cream.[14]
