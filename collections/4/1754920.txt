A two-time NBA MVP, Nash is only the second point guard (along with Magic Johnson) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back-to-back MVPs (joining Johnson and Michael Jordan).[8] Only ten other NBA players have won back-to-back MVP awards: Johnson, Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry.[8] On 11 May 2006, ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th-best point guard of all time,[96] and in a survey by nba.com in 2007, Nash received 85% of the votes by the league's general managers as best point guard in the league.[97] In a similar survey in 2009, Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball IQ.[98]
