Corinthian McVitie Keogh is the son of Gaz Wilkinson and Janet Keogh. Born in series 5, nine months after Janet slept with Gaz. The baby's middle name reflects Jonny Keogh's love of biscuits, McVitie's being a biscuit brand. Although Jonny raises him as his own until his death, Corinthian's paternity is initially uncertain. Gaz attempts to claim him in series 6, but doubts he is the father after he finds out about his low sperm count. However, in series 7 a DNA test finally reveals Gaz to be the father. Gaz decides not to inform Janet of this, as she sees Corinthian as a reminder of Jonny. In Series 8, the episode "Gazman" finds Gaz applying to family court for parental responsibility for Corinthian, but Corinthian moves away with Janet before the beginning of the ninth series.
