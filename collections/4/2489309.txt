Mechanical approaches, such as vacuuming up the insects and heat-treating or wrapping mattresses, are effective.[6][56] An hour at a temperature of 45 °C (113 °F) or over, or two hours at less than −17 °C (1 °F) kills them.[56] This may include a domestic clothes drier for fabric or a commercial steamer. Bed bugs and their eggs will die on contact when exposed to surface temperatures above 180 degrees and a steamer can reach well above 230 degrees.[61][15] A study found 100% mortality rates for bed bugs exposed to temperatures greater than 50 °C (122 °F) for more than 2 minutes. The study recommended maintaining temperatures of above 48 °C for more than 20 min to effectively kill all life stages of bed bugs, and because in practice treatment times of 6 to 8 hours are used to account for cracks and indoor clutter.[62] This method is expensive and has caused fires.[56][15] Starving them is not effective as they can survive without eating for 100 to 300 days, depending on temperature.[56] One expert, writing in Scientific American in 2012, says "I wouldn't try to get rid of an infestation on my own. I would call a pest control operator".[59]
