Shooting began on March 31, 1925. Sergei began with filming in Leningrad and had time to shoot the railway strike episode, horsecar, city at night and the strike crackdown on Sadovaya Street. Further shooting was prevented by deteriorating weather with fog setting in. At the same time the director faced tight time constraints: the film needed to be finished by the end of the year, although the script was approved only on 4 June. Objectively assessing the situation, Sergei Eisenstein decided to give up the original script, consisting of eight episodes, to focus only on one. This was the uprising on the battleship "Potemkin", which in the all-encompassing scenario of Agadzhanova took up only a few pages (41 frames). Sergei Eisenstein together with Grigori Aleksandrov essentially recycled and extended the script.[9] In addition, during the progress of making the film, some episodes were added which were not provided for in Agadzhanova's scenario or Eisenstein's scenic sketches, such as the storm scene with which the film begins. As a result, the content of the film was very far from the original script by Agadzhanova.
