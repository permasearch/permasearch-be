In 2001, Lynne becomes friends with womanising club owner Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco) and she often babysits his son, Joe (Jake Kyprianou). Lynne and Beppe soon become attracted to each other and have sex on the eve of Lynne's wedding to Garry. Beppe feels Garry does not deserve Lynne and tries to stop Lynne marrying him by turning up at the register office and starting a fight with Garry. Lynne is tempted but goes through with the wedding. Beppe sends Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) to give her a note, but he throws it away. The marriage does not go smoothly, however, and in 2002 Lynne strays again, this time with ex-lover Jason James (Joseph Millson). Jason is Lynne's ex-fiancÃ©, who jilted her on their wedding day and fled to Dubai. After a chance meeting, the two rekindle their relationship as Jason wants to reconcile and almost persuades her to leave Garry and move away with him. However, at the last minute, Lynne changes her mind and chooses to stay with her family instead of following her heart. Garry forgives Lynne as he is desperate to hang onto her but the trust has gone from their relationship.
