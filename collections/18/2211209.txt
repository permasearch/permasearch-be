In an interview in June 2012, Del Rey said she would not release the song as a single but did plan to release a music video in September 2012.[2] However, no music video was released, and on January 29, 2013, an official radio edit of "Dark Paradise" was serviced to German radio stations. On the same day, it was announced that the song would serve as the fifth single in Austria and Germany, and the sixth single in Switzerland.[3] It was released as a digital download in the three countries on March 1, 2013.
