Most SNPs that increase the risk of diabetes reside in noncoding regions of the genes, making the SNPâ€™s mechanism for increasing susceptibility largely unknown. However, they are thought to influence the susceptibility by altering the regulation of those gene expressions. Only few genes (PARG6, KCNJ11-ABCC8, SLC30A8, and GCKR) have SNPs in the open reading frame (ORF).[4] These SNPs in ORFs result in altering of the protein function, and the altered function and therefore compromise the performances of the protein product causes increased susceptibility to the type 2 diabetes.
