In democracies, large proportions of the population are provided the means to either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means is voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.
