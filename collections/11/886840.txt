Cipriano coached Nebraska to another 20-victory season in 1977–78. The Cornhuskers, led by All-Big Eight guard Brian Banks, finished with a 22–8 record and advanced to the second round of the NIT. By 1979, Cipriano's failing health – he would die of cancer the following year – meant he had to share coaching duties with assistant Moe Iba, and they took Nebraska to the NIT again. For their efforts, the duo shared United Press International Big Eight Coach-of-the-Year honors.
