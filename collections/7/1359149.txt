The Shockers are currently coached by Gregg Marshall, who replaced current Maryland coach Mark Turgeon before the 2007â€“08 season. Under Marshall, the Shockers have one College Basketball Invitational appearance, two back-to-back NIT appearances (2010 and 2011), including an NIT championship in 2011, and six consecutive NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament appearances in 2012 through 2017. Under Marshall, the Shockers returned to the Final Four in 2013 for the first time since 1965, as champions of the West Regional. Marshall is currently tied for first place for all-time wins as a Wichita State coach with 220, as well as owning the third-highest winning percentage in WSU history, and the highest since 1933. While this may not be a big deal to Coach Marshall, he did note that the only non athlete honored in the rafters of Koch Arena is Coach Ralph Miller, with whom he is now tied.
