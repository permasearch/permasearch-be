Beginning with the 2008 season, Votto shared time platooning at first base with Scott Hatteberg until Manager Dusty Baker began playing Votto as the Reds' starting first baseman in early April. On April 15, he hit his first home run of the season off of Michael Wuertz. He drove in a career-high five runs against the Cubs two games later.
