A common feature of street basketball is the pick up game. To participate in most streetball games around the world, one simply goes to an outdoor court where people are playing, indicates a wish to participate, and from all the players who were at the court before one has played, one will get to pick their team out of the players available and play a game. Generally, the team captains alternate their choices, but different courts have differing rules in regards to player selection. Many games play up to 7, 11, 13, 15, or 21 points with baskets counting for 1 and 2 points. It is possible to do (1's only), (2's only), (1's and 2's), (2's and 3's) or (1's, 2's and 3's) 1's only - each basket counts as 1 point 2's only - each basket counts as 2 points 1's and 2's - each basket counts as 1 point if inside the arc, or 2 points if outside the arc 2's and 3's - each basket counts as 2 points if inside the arc, or 3 points if outside the arc 1's, 2's and 3's - You need at least 3 teams for this, baskets count as 1 or 2 points until one of the 3 teams score a certain number of points, then the other 2 teams play for second place with baskets counting for 2 and 3 points Players often play 'win by 2' which, as in tennis, means that the team has to win by a margin of at least 2 points. Sometimes a local "dead end" limit applies; for instance a game may be played to 7, win by 2, with a 9-point dead end, (referred to as "7 by 2's, 9 straight") which would mean scores of 7-3, 8-6, or 9-8 would all be final, while with scores of 7-6 or 8-7, play would continue. The most common streetball game is 3 on 3 played half court, though 5 on 5 full court can be found. Another common variation to the rules is the "skunk" rule. This merely means that if a player reaches a certain point without the other player scoring, the game is over. The skunk rule limit can vary, but is often used at the score 7 to 0.
