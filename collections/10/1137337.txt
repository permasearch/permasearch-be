OTS did not receive a government budget; instead, they were funded by the banks they regulate, like other U.S. federal bank regulators.[1] Other regulatory agencies like the OTS include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration.
