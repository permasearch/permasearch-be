Recent algorithms for finding the SVM classifier include sub-gradient descent and coordinate descent. Both techniques have proven to offer significant advantages over the traditional approach when dealing with large, sparse datasetsâ€”sub-gradient methods are especially efficient when there are many training examples, and coordinate descent when the dimension of the feature space is high.
