In the 2015 'reboot' of the series, Jeff vanished over the Mariana Trench (it is unknown whether he is still alive or deceased) some time ago in a plane accident involving the 'first Thunderbird' named "TV21",[8] for which the Hood has claimed responsibility.[9] Scott appears to have assumed control of International Rescue in his father's place as he is the oldest of the Tracy brothers, while Grandma Tracy, who has herself changed from the classic series, has taken over his role as head of the family.
