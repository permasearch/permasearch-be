The airport's terminal until the 1970s was located off Virginia Avenue, on the north side of the airport. It was designed around six pier concourses radiating from a central building.[22] Construction began on the present midfield terminal in January 1977 under the administration of Mayor Maynard Jackson. It was the largest construction project in the South, costing $500 million. The complex was designed by Stevens & Wilkinson, Smith Hinchman & Grylls, and Minority Airport Architects & Planners.[23] Renamed for former Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield, who did much to promote air travel, the airport reopened on September 21, 1980, on-time and under budget.[24] It was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers per year and covered 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m²). In December 1984 a 9,000-foot (2,700 m) fourth parallel runway was completed and another runway was extended to 11,889 feet (3,624 m) the following year.[18]
