In 1986 Grave Digger underwent a transformation to complete monster truck and first received its famous black graveyard paint scheme.  In 1987 and 1988 Anderson drove the truck primarily at TNT Motorsports races and became a crowd favorite for driving hard despite lacking major funding that better-known teams, like Bigfoot, had.  In 1987, Anderson beat Bigfoot in Saint Paul, Minnesota on a show taped for ESPN.  It was the first major victory for Grave Digger.
