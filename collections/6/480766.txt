She appeared as Maggie, Jack Black's girlfriend in Nancy Meyers's romantic comedy The Holiday.[62] The movie co-starred Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law,[63] and premiered in December 2006.[64] It was a major commercial success, with US$205,135,324 grossed worldwide.[65] On January 2, 2007, she debuted on Courteney Cox's drama series Dirt on FX.[66] Her role was Kira Klay, a troubled young drug-addicted actress who after realizing that she is pregnant, kills herself.[67] Her death happens in the pilot, where that is the only episode she is "alive." She appears in four more episodes as a ghostly figment of Ian Hart's character imagination, becoming a sort of love interest. Her last airdate was on March 27, 2007 (episode "Ita Missa Est").[67] She also starred in the horror movie Catacombs as Victoria, a young woman trying to find her way out of the Paris Catacombs while being pursued by a killer. It received a theatrical release in countries like Italy and Japan throughout 2007, but came out directly-to-DVD in United States in February 2008.[68][69] Catacombs and Sossamon generated mostly negative reviews; About.com wrote that her "Ambien-induced acting doesn't help matters",[70] and DVD Verdict stated: "This film is all Sossamon and I feel for her. Aside from the uninspired twist finale, her performance is comprised solely of gasping and looking worried and furrowing her brow and screaming and gazing worriedly at her flickering flashlight".[71]
