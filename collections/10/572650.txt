According to Craig Blomberg, one characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the Gospel accounts is that he delivered benefits freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment for his healing miracles, unlike some high priests of his time who charged those who were healed.[13] In Matthew 10:8 he advised his disciples to heal the sick without payment and stated: "freely ye received, freely give."[13]
