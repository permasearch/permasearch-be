On November 29, 1944, the first successful operation for tetralogy of Fallot was performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1943, the syndrome had been brought to the attention of surgeon Alfred Blalock by pediatric cardiologist Helen B. Taussig. Taussig was trying to figure out a way to treat the hundreds of babies and children who had congenital blue baby syndrome. Blalock's surgical technician, Vivien Thomas, had earlier developed for another purpose a procedure involving the anastomosis, or joining, of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery. Adapting this procedure for patients with tetralogy of Fallot gave the blood another chance to become oxygenated. The surgery, which became known as a Blalock-Taussig shunt, rapidly spread worldwide as the treatment of choice for Tetralogy of Fallot.[9] Thomas, an African American, was later recognized as the true developer of the procedure, which is sometimes called the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. In 1976, Johns Hopkins University presented Thomas with an honorary doctorate.[10]
