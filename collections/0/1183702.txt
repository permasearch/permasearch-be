A French-backed expedition called Everest Green went on an independent waste-retrieval mission, collecting about five tonnes of garbage from the Nepal base camp up to the South Col area.[36] Of that, three tonnes were able to be recycled, and the mission ran for 40 days between April 13 and May 23.[36]
