Kitchener struggled through the decade, posting only two winning seasons (1971-72: 31-24-8 and 1973-74: 43-18-9). In 1973â€“74, the Rangers finished first in the OHA for their third Hamilton Spectator Trophy in eight years in large part due to the stellar goalkeeping of Don Edwards who boasted the league's lowest goals against average. The team also featured Paul Evans, Dwight Foster and Doug Risebrough, but lost in the semi-finals to the Peterborough Petes.
