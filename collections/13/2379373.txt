Being a developing nation, India is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its dependence on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture and forestry.[17] Low per capita incomes and small public budgets also lead to low financial adaptive capacity.[17] The nation is vulnerable to the immediate socio-economic effects of climate change. A 2002 study indicated that the temperature over the country increased at around 0.57Â° per 100 years.[17])
