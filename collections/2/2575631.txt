An ideal cost curve assumes technical efficiency, since a firm always has an incentive to be as technically efficient as possible. In general, firms have a variety of methods of using various amounts of inputs, and they select the lowest total cost method for any given amount of output (quantity produced). For example, if you wanted to make a few pins, the cheapest way to accomplish this might be by hiring one jack-of-all-trades and buying a scrap of metal and having him work on it in your home. But if you wished to produce thousands of pins, the lowest total cost might be achieved by renting a factory, buying specialized equipment and hiring an assembly line of factory workers to perform specialized actions at each stage of producing the pin. In the short run, you might not have time to rent a factory, or buy specialized tools, or hire factory workers. Then you would be able to achieve short run minimum costs, but you know the long run costs would be much less. The increase in choices available of how to produce in the long run means that long run costs are always equal to or less than the short run costs, ceteris paribus.
