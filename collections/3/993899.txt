The song was the B-side for "Strange Brew" in June 1967, several months ahead of the group's second album, Disraeli Gears, which included both songs.  AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald calls it, "One of a few overtly psychedelic songs to have aged gracefullyÂ ... Lyrically, it's a relatively factual and colorful rendering of the great Greek tragedy Ulysses".[1]
