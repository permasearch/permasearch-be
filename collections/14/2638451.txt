The third type was the Canadian Pacer, which was historically better documented than the other two types. Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England. The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice.[1] From there, they were exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s.[1] Pedigrees were not maintained, so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace.[21] The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker,[1] the American Saddlebred[1] and the Standardbred.[1]
