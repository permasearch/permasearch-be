The hypoglossal nerve is derived from the first pair of occipital somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development.[7] The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites.[8][9] The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.[7][10]
