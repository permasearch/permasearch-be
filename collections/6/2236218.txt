In the developing world about 1.2% of deliveries are associated with PPH and when PPH occurred about 3% of women died.[2] Globally it occurs about 8.7 million times and results in 44,000 to 86,000 deaths per year making it the leading cause of death during pregnancy.[4][2][7] About 0.4 women per 100,000 deliveries die from PPH in the United Kingdom while about 150 women per 100,000 deliveries die in sub-Saharan Africa.[2] Rates of death have decreased substantially since at least the late 1800s in the United Kingdom.[2]
