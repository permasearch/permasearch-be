On January 31, 2017, Trump nominated federal appellate judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch's appointment was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after a 54â€“45 vote.[102] Prior to this nomination, 60 votes had been required for Supreme Court nominees to be moved to a confirmation vote over a filibuster, via invoking cloture. The 60-vote total previously needed to advance the vote was not met due to Democratic opposition. To allow the nomination to proceed, the "nuclear option" was deployed, requiring only a simple majority, 51 votes, for cloture for a nominee.[103]
