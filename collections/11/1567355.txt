The Eclipse was available in 7 trim levels: RS, GS, GS Spyder, GT, GT Spyder, GTS, and GTS Spyder. All trim levels (besides Spyder) came with an automatic tilt and retracting sunroof. All models were FWD. The GTS trims were introduced for the 2003 model year. For the 2005 model year, the RS trim was discontinued and a special "Remix Edition" GS trim package was introduced, which included chrome wheels, identifying placards and the premium interior package from the GT and GTS models, which was not previously offered on the GS trim.
