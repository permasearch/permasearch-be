Gershwin began his work on January 7 as dated on the original manuscript for two pianos.[2] The piece was titled "American Rhapsody" during composition. The title Rhapsody in Blue was suggested by Ira Gershwin after his visit to a gallery exhibition of James McNeill Whistler paintings, which bear titles such as Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket and Arrangement in Grey and Black (better known as Whistler's Mother).[8] After a few weeks, Gershwin finished his composition and passed the score to Whiteman's arranger Ferde Grof√©, who orchestrated the piece, finishing it on February 4, only eight days before the premiere.[9]
