Through a series of rounds, the contestant is asked to select a number of the other cases still in play; each case is opened and the value revealed before it is taken out of play, and a large electronic board is used to track which dollar amounts still remain in the game.  After completing the selection of cases for that round, the Banker, a silhouette figure lit only dimly from behind in a skybox overlooking the stage, will call down to the host using a phone on the podium.  The host will then tell the player of the Banker's "offer": a cash value that depends on the values of the cases remaining in play, in exchange for leaving the game.  The host opens a Plexiglas case on the podium containing a button; if the player accepts the deal, he or she presses the button to end the game, otherwise, he or she closes the case and declares "No Deal," requiring the player to continue into the next round.
