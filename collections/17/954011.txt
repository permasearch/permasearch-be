Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently.[272] The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specify whether lions or other creatures are "rampant" (rearing) or "passant" (crouching).[273]
