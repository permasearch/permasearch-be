In 1882, Adolf Mayer (1843–1942) described a condition of tobacco plants, which he called  "mosaic disease" ("mozaïkziekte"). The diseased plants had variegated leaves that were mottled.[33] He excluded the possibility of a fungal infection and could not detect any bacterium and speculated that a "soluble, enzyme-like infectious principle was involved".[34] He did not pursue his idea any further, and it was the filtration experiments of Ivanovsky and Beijerinck that suggested the cause was a previously unrecognised infectious agent. After tobacco mosaic was recognized as a virus disease, virus infections of many other plants were discovered.[34]
