The region has a Catholic majority, but also a significant Lutheran Protestant population (especially in Northern WÃ¼rttemberg and some parts of Baden and Franconia (Northern Bavaria)), in contrast to the almost entirely Protestant Northern Germany. Due to the immigration of non-Christians, mainly Turks (see Turks in Germany) during the last decades of the twentieth century, there is also a small number (roughly 250.000, i.e. 2-3% of the population) of Muslims.
