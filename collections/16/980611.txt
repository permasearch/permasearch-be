In early 2000, the clock started to run backward because the national debt was actually decreasing.[6][10] It showed a national debt of $5.7 trillion and an individual family share of almost $74,000. With the original purpose of the clock being to highlight the rising debt, the reversal of the figures gave a mixed message, added to the fact that the display not being designed to properly run backward.[1] In May 2000, it was reported that the clock was planned to be unplugged on September 7, 2000, what would have been Seymour Durst's 87th birthday. Douglas said that the decision to unplug the clock was made because "it was put up to focus attention on the increasing national debt, and it's served its purpose."[12] In September, the clock was unplugged and covered with a red-white-and-blue curtain, with the national debt standing at roughly 5.7 trillion dollars.[1] However, less than two years later in July 2002, the curtain was raised and the clock once again picked up tracking a rising debt,[13] starting at 6.1 trillion dollars.[14]
