The major political parties across India took conflicting stands. While several members and leaders of the centre-ruled BJP called for an outright ban on the film, the Rajasthan State unit of the party and that of the INC adopted a stance in favour of the Rajput community, stating that the makers of the film must not offend "people's sentiments". The Economic Times attributed this stance to the State elections due to be held the following year, and their attempts to not offend the said majority community.[122] Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) condemned the protests.[123] Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress shared similar views and claimed the prevalence of "super emergency" in the country and called the controversy a "calculated plan of a political party to destroy the freedom to express ourselves."[124] The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena gave its support to the makers tacitly and said that the party would take a stance upon watching the film.[125] Ajmer Sharif Dargah's Syed Zainul Abedin Ali Khan also urged Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban the release of the film, likening Bhansali to Rushdie, Taslima Nasreen and Tareq Fatah, authors who supposedly hurt the sentiments of Muslims.[126]
