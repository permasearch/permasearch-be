With a production budget of ₹2.15 billion (US$33 million), Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.[7][8][9] Initially scheduled for release on 1 December 2017, Padmavat faced numerous controversies. Amid violent protests, its release was indefinitely delayed. In December, the Central Board of Film Certification approved the film with few changes, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and a change in title.[10][11] Padmaavat was rescheduled for release on 25 January 2018 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D formats, making it the first Indian film to be released in IMAX 3D.[12]
