Therefore, the objective function attains the global maximum (subject to the constraints) at     ( ±   2   , 1 )   {\displaystyle (\pm {\sqrt {2}},1)}   and the global minimum at     ( ±   2   , − 1 ) .   {\displaystyle (\pm {\sqrt {2}},-1).}   The point     ( 0 ,   3   )   {\displaystyle (0,{\sqrt {3}})}   is a local minimum of f and     ( 0 , −   3   )   {\displaystyle (0,-{\sqrt {3}})}   is a local maximum of f, as may be determined by consideration of the Hessian matrix of       L   ( x , y , 0 )   {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(x,y,0)}  .
