"I was first scheduled to All Creatures in 1989," explained wardrobe member Helen Scarsbrook. "An average day's filming would often start around 6am at the unit base in Leyburn, which was an old empty school where we kept all the costumes and equipment. The actors would arrive and we would dress everybody. Then we would load up the unit cars — which in Yorkshire were a couple of Ford Sierra estates — so we could pile up the costumes for all the changes. Then we would drive out to location, which was quite often Bainbridge, so quite a long journey."[1]
