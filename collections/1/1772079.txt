Yan was sincere about his attempts to modernize Shanxi, and achieved success in some regards. Throughout his rule he attempted to promote social reforms that later came to be taken for granted, but which were highly controversial in his time: the abolition of foot binding; work for women outside the home; universal primary education; and the existence of peasant militias as a fundamental unit of the army. He was possibly the warlord most committed to his province in his era, but was constantly challenged by his own dilettantism and the selfishness and incompetence of his own officials.[85]
