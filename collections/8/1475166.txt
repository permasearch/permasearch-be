In April 2009, Jágr publicly stated an interest in returning to the NHL, stating that he really just needed a break from the pressures of an 82-game NHL schedule. Jágr, who claimed to have lost 15 pounds since his last NHL season, and who was "practicing a lot harder than [he] ever did in [his] life", stated he would be interested in joining the Edmonton Oilers because of the interest they showed in July 2008.[15] Following the expiration of his original contract with Avangard, however, Jágr re-signed with Avangard for the 2010–11 season.[16]
