An early reference to Dear John letters was made in a United Press article of March 21, 1944.[3] It has been claimed that the Vietnam War inspired more Dear John letters than any other US conflict.[4] Later, this type of letter formed background to the British television show Dear John, and the American sitcom of the same name.[citation needed] A Dear Jane letter is a contemporary version of a Dear John letter addressed to a female lover.[2]
