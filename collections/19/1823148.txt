Marvel suffered a blow in early 1992, when seven of its most prized artists — Todd McFarlane (known for his work on Spider-Man), Jim Lee (X-Men), Rob Liefeld (X-Force), Marc Silvestri (Wolverine), Erik Larsen (The Amazing Spider-Man), Jim Valentino (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Whilce Portacio (Uncanny X-Men) — left to form Image Comics[52] in a deal brokered by Malibu Comics' owner Scott Mitchell Rosenberg.[53] Three years later Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel on November 3, 1994,[53][54][55][56][56][57][58] who acquired the then-leading standard for computer coloring of comic books (developed by Rosenberg) in the process,[59] but also integrating the Genesis Universe (Earth-1136) and the Ultraverse (Earth-93060) into Marvel's multiverse.
