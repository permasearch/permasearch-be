In the book The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways, Awdry explained the difference in James' appearance from a Class 28. James was built by Hughes as an experiment to see if the nose-heaviness could be counter-acted. The locomotive was fitted with larger (5' 6") driving wheels and a pony truck, making it into a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement.[1] (The real Class 28 has 5' 1" wheels.[2]) James is also missing the prominent front sandboxes fitted to the Class 28s.[3] The improvement was not as great as hoped for, and after the grouping, the LMS sold James to the Fat Controller's North Western Railway.[1] As with most of the early Railway Series characters, which were not so closely based on real locomotive classes, Awdry's explanation is a case of retroactive continuity.
