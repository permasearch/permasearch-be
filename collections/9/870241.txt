Episodes deal with life in a small town, amongst various different types of people: the farmers (the "hicks"), the out-of-towners who make up the local hockey team, the town's minister, the local drug addicts (the "skids"), and members of the local First Nation (the "natives"). Often plots revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as "the toughest guy in Letterkenny", the exploits of the local hockey team, and Wayne's attempt to break up his sister's open relationship with two of the members of the team, the various schemes by "the skids" to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the reservation, and Wayne's various attempts to find love. In later seasons, the scripts feature wordplay and puns as a running joke to convey the intelligence of the small town characters.
