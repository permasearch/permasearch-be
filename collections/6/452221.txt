A monopolist should shut down when price (average revenue) is less than average variable cost for every output level;[29] in other words, it should shut down if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve.[30] Under these circumstances, even at the profit-maximizing level of output (where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost) average revenue would be lower than average variable costs and the monopolist would be better off shutting down in the short run.[31]
