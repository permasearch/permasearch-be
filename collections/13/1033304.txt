The United States government designated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as the group's primary name, believing "Levant" to be the more accurate translation.[9][13][14] It also listed the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), ad-Dawla al-Islamiyya fi al-'Iraq wa-sh-Sham, Daesh, Dawla al Islamiya, and Al-Furqan Establishment for Media Production, as aliases. This was to disassociate the group from the al-Nusrah Front (ANF), as a result of the rift between the two groups.[9] Usage has not been consistent however, with ISIS, ISIL, Islamic State and Daesh all being used variously, both domestically and overseas, with the precise term chosen based on the audience, recognising the need for consistency and that the American public was more familiar with ISIL, while also catering to partners who are more attached to Daesh.[14] President Barack Obama used ISIL.[12] In February 2017, the Pentagon adopted the abbreviation ISIS when referencing the group.[15]
