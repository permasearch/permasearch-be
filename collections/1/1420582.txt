A recent scientific study, performed on mobile phone data of an entire European country and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in Italy, demonstrated that even today individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits: returners and explorers.[6] According to this research published on Nature Communications,[6] today's explorers have a tendency to wander between a large number of different locations showing a star-like mobility pattern: they have a central core of locations (composed by home and work places) around which distant core of locations gravitates.[6][7] Interestingly, two features characterize today's explorers: 1) They are more likely to spread infectious diseases when traveling, due to their mobility patterns; 2) They tend to communicate preferably with other explorers, i.e. they show a communication homophily with people in the same mobility category.[6]
