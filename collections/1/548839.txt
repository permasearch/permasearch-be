The long-standing designation "The Three Peaks" is well known locally, and in past times nationally. However, there are now a number of "National" Three Peaks adventure challenges involving Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike (respectively the highest summits in Scotland, Wales and England). The epithet "Yorkshire" is therefore now commonly added to differentiate Yorkshire's Three Peaks from those (although Whernside is partially in Cumbria, with the summit trig point being narrowly on the Cumbria side).
