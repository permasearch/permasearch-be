Top 100 DJs is considered to be hugely important to DJs as an influencer of booking fees and their current level of popularity. DJs regularly campaign for votes, a process which is allowed by the magazine.[19] Dutch DJ Hardwell once did a skydive as part of his campaign video;[20] David Guetta regularly creates animated videos as part of his voting campaign;[20] Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike released an exclusive mix to their fans as part of their 2015 campaign.[21] However, due to the weight that is placed on Top 100 DJs ranking by bookers worldwide, there have been criticisms of the poll.
