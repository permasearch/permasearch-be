Clan Muir is a Scottish clan that is armigerous (it has no chief recognized by the Court of the Lord Lyon).[1] Historically, holders of the surname Muir (also spelt Moir, Moor, Moore, More, and Mure) can be considered septs of Clan Campbell [2] and septs of Clan Gordon in the highlands.[3] The spelling variation More/Moore is a sept of Clan Leslie in Aberdeenshire.[4] Some members of Clan Muir who trace their ancestry to Ayrshire are septs of Clan Boyd.[5] A single family, the Mores of Drumcork, are septs of Clan Grant.[6]
