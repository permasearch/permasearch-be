The current name of the gulf appeared at least during the 13th century (in medieval Latin sinus Leonis, mare Leonis) and could come from comparison with a lion: it would simply suggest that this part of the sea is as dangerous as a lion because it has very violent, surprising winds that threaten boats (sailors and fishermen know these dangers very well[1]). This comparison with a lion is suggested by various converging sources: Deroy and Mulon's dictionary of French place names,[2] Mistral's comprehensive Occitan dictionary,[3] Diderot and D'Alembert's famous French encyclopedia[4] and several texts in Latin since the 13th century.[5][6]
