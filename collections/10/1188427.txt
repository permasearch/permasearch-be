A national tour modeled after the 2010 Broadway Revival began in September 2011 starting in Des Moines, Iowa. At first, Mr. Fierstein was asked to play the role of Georges and Mr. Sieber was asked to play the role of Albin, each taking the role each other had played on Broadway. Due to a full schedule, as having to write the book of the Disney musical Newsies and the musical Kinky Boots, Mr. Fierstein had to decline this offer.  This tour starred George Hamilton in the role of Georges and Christopher Sieber as Albin. Sieber, who was very critically praised for his portrayal of Albin, had previously played the role of 'Georges' on Broadway opposite Harvey Fierstein. This was Sieber's national tour debut.[39][40]
