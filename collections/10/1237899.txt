The Grand Councilwoman is the leader of the United Galactic Federation. Others occasionally refer to her as 'Your Majesty' and 'Your Highness', and on the whole, she seems both reasonable and well-intentioned, although, like many members of the United Galactic Federation, she knows almost nothing about Earth or its inhabitants. She is of an unknown species by name, but she seems to be reminiscent of a grey alien, with hoof-shaped feet, big eyes, and a big head. She is voiced by Australian actress Zoe Caldwell. It seems, that the Grand Councilwoman has a status as the supreme ruler of the galactic federation (similar to an empress in an empire).
