As a reward, Cinderpelt was reincarnated after her death into one of the kits she defended, Cinderheart in the Power of Three series. Cinderheart herself is not aware of this consciously, however she occasionally exhibits knowledge that she cannot explain from her previous life, and knows of her reincarnation in dreams. The implications of this "second life", as well as Cinderpelt's true destiny, have become realized when Jayfeather reveals it to her in a dream. Just before the battle in The Last Hope, Cinderheart chooses to be a warrior and Lionblaze's mate, and Cinderpelt leaves Cinderheart's body, whispering, "Thank you". Cinderpelt was mentored by Yellowfang, and mentored her cousin Sandstorm's daughter Leafpool as her successor. Her mother is Frostfur, which makes Thornclaw and Brightheart her siblings. Her brother, Brackenfur, is the father of Cinderheart, a situation which is slightly confusing given Cinderpelt's reincarnation. This would imply, then, that Cinderpelt's brother is now her father, though the new Cinderheart is still very much an individual cat in her own right. As Cinderpelt has a reincarnation, Cinderheart is related to Bluestar since Sorreltail's father was Whitestorm, who was Bluestar's nephew.
