On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. Many identify Johnson as being one of the first to fight back in the clashes with the police during the uprising.[9][13] Though Johnson is cited by some as having "started" the rebellion, Johnson herself disputed the account in 1987, stating she had arrived at around "2 [o'clock] in the morning", stating "the riots had already started" when she arrived and that the Stonewall building "was on fire" after cops set it on fire.[12] The riots reportedly started at around 1:20 that morning.[9] According to David Carter, in the book, Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Revolution, it was stated Johnson on the first night, "threw a shot glass at a mirror in the torched bar screaming, 'I got my civil rights'", while on the second night, Johnson "climbed on top of a lamppost" and dropped a heavy object into the windshield of a police car.[9] Carter listed Johnson alongside Jackie Hormona and Zazu Nova as being the "three individuals known to have been in the vanguard" of the escalation of the Stonewall uprising.[9]
