Khan was born on 2 November 1965 in a Muslim family in New Delhi.[2] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[8][9][b] According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, an ethnic Pashtun, was from Afghanistan.[11][12] Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist in Peshawar, British India (present-day Pakistan). As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khawani Bazaar.[11] Meer was a follower of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[13] and affiliated with the All Indian National Congress.[11] He moved to New Delhi in 1948 after the partition of India.[14] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[15][c] His parents were married in 1959.[18] Khan described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), [and] some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[19] His paternal cousins in Peshawar claim that the family is of Hindkowan origin from Kashmir, not Pashtun, and also contradict the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan.[11][20]
