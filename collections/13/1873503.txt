The equivalent figures for the year 2013/14 were 25.478 million total licences including 4.328 million licences for the over 75s.[44] In 2014/15, the BBC estimated that there were 26.916 million licensable properties in the UK (defined as premises where live TV was being watched),[43] indicating that if the BBC estimates are correct, around 95% of properties are correctly licensed.
