The Andaman Sea, particularly the western coast of the Malay Peninsula, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India are rich in coral reefs and offshore islands with spectacular topography. Despite having been damaged by the 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, they remain popular tourist destinations.[20] The nearby coast also has numerous marine national parks – 16 only in Thailand, and four of them are candidates for inclusion into UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[9]:7–8
