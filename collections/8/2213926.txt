The song was also featured on the In the Flesh tour as the show opener. Pyrotechnics were used in many venues and a huge inflated pig used for album cover shoot and jet fly over in Cleveland. It was later almost a part of the setlist for the 1987â€“90 tour supporting the album A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but Gilmour felt like his voice couldn't reach high enough like Waters. It wasn't performed by any Pink Floyd member until Roger Waters performed it on his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour.
