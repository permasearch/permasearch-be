Alex is caught off guard when she discovers that Stevie is leading a wizard revolution. To the dismay of Justin and Harper, she decides to help Stevie with her quest to make sure no wizard ever has to give up their powers again. Alex agrees to Stevie shortly after Stevie barricades the wizard portal with a broom stick. Alex and Stevie also ask Max to join in their revolution, to which Max agrees. Max also declares himself as king, so the two girls have to obey his commands. Justin, knowing his sisters antics, orders a Chinese meal that comes with magic fortune cookies that possess the ability to give a glimpse into the future, thus allowing Justin to find out what Alex will end up doing. Alex is seen telling Harper that after it was all over, they would still be friends. Justin tries to stop her, thinking that she would go through with Stevie's plan, but Alex ends up tricking Stevie, using her wand to turn Stevie into a rock-type substance, freezing her body, and transporting all of Stevie's magical powers to her brother. Shortly after this sequence, Max curiously pokes Stevie's frozen body, accidentally tipping her over. Upon impact with the floor, Stevie's frozen body breaks into hundreds of pieces. To Alex it does not matter, because she still has her only true friend Harper, who was, is, and will always be there for Alex until the very end.
