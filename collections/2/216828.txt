Burial 85 dates to the Late Preclassic and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones.[26][31] The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis.[26] The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle.[158] The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband.[26][159] This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king.[56] Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.[159]
