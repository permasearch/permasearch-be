The national tour of Matilda had its first official performance on 7 June 2015 at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Mia Sinclair Jenness played the title role. On 15 June 2015, the three Matildas along with Tim Minchin performed on Conan.[59] On 29 November 2015, Jenness left the touring cast and was replaced by former Broadway Matilda Tori Feinstein on 5 December 2015. Shortly after, it was announced that three new girls would be stepping into the role of Matilda: Lily Brooks O'Briant, Savannah Grace Elmer, and Sarah McKinley Austin. Matilda was the tour debut for both Elmer and Brooks; Austin had previously toured with Once. Tyler, Feinstein, and Gutierrez bowed out over the next few weeks, with Tyler playing her last performance on 20 December, Feinstein departing on 28 December, and Gutierrez ending her run on 10 January 2016. Elmer, Brooks, and Austin debuted on 19 December 2015, 2 January 2016, and 9 January 2016, respectively. This second cast concluded touring on 26 June 2016, with the tour scheduled to resume again later for another six months.
