In 1875, he framed The Explosives Act, the first modern legislation for explosives control.[3] He also pioneered many bomb disposal techniques, including remote methods for the handling and dismantling of explosives.[2] His advice during the Fenian dynamite campaign of 1881-85[4] was officially recognised as having contributed to the saving of lives. After Victoria Station was bombed on 26 February 1884 he defused a bomb with a clockwork mechanism which might have gone off at any moment.[5]
