When the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places.[65] When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexicanâ€“American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal "territory" and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region.[66] Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves.[67]
