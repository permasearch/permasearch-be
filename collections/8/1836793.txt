Johnson described the song as "a seriously banging pop EP", and a welcome departure from the first two tracks of the album, "Aura" and "Venus". She described the song to be "an ode to taking on the submissive role in a relationship".[19] Stacy-Ann Ellis from Vibe deemed the song "almost clever".[23] Brian Tank from The Buffalo News called the track a "catchy and fun" song which made one "feel happy and dance along".[24] Writing for Fact, William Bennett described the song as incredible.[25] Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times felt that "G.U.Y." helped the Artpop album have a "fresh" sound.[26] Annie Zalenski of The A.V. Club praised it as one of the album's highlights.[27] The song was called an "instant hit" by Mike Driver from Clash who found the usage of handclaps and the chorus as addictive.[28] Clare Considine from Time Out found the song to be inspired by the work of Madonna and David Bowie, in its "cosmic pansexual playfulness".[29] Brad Wheeler from The Globe and Mail noted the erotic elements associated with the track, jokingly adding that "one imagines Gaga's choreographer is busy at work on the song's live erotica possibilities as we speak."[30]
