In 1970, Wales shared the Five Nations with France, and recorded a 6–6 draw against South Africa in Cardiff.[46] The following year Wales recorded their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1952. Using only 16 players in four games,[47] the 1971 side achieved their most notable win of the tournament in their victory over Scotland;[48] after a last minute try by Gerald Davies that reduced Scotland's lead to 18–17, flanker John Taylor kicked a conversion from the sideline described as "the greatest conversion since St Paul" to give Wales a 19–18 win.[49] Wales contributed more players than any other team to the British and Irish Lions that toured New Zealand that year. Those Lions became the only to win a series over the All Blacks.[50]
