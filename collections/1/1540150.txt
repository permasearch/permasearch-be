The highlight of the town is the annual inter-college sports championship with a marathon cycle race as the prime event. In the beginning of the film, the race is contested between Ratan Lal Sharma (Mamik Singh) of Model College and Shekhar Malhotra (Deepak Tijori) of Rajput College with the latter winning the race because Ratan had an inferior bike. After the race, both are felicitated by their respective schools for which Shekhar becomes cocky and arrogant.
