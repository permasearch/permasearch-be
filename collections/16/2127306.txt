Various species of pinnipeds and belugas[61] were introduced into Black Sea by mankind and later escaped either by accidental or purported causes. Of these, grey seal has been recorded within Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov.[62] Mediterranean monk seals became extinct in the Black Sea in 1997,[63] and historic presences of large whales such as minke whales into Black Sea is recorded,[64][65] although it is unclear whether these mammals historically occurred in the Azov Basin.
