Gilbert Stanley Underwood and William Dewey Foster won the contract for the War Department building. They designed the building during 1938â€“1939 and construction began in 1940. The Public Buildings Administration of the Federal Works Agency, which inherited oversight responsibility for the federal buildings program from the U.S. Treasury Department in 1939, completed the first phase of the building in 1941.[3]
