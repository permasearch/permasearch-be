The Caribbean hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus, also known as the soldier crab,[2] the West Atlantic crab, the tree crab, and the purple pincher (due to the distinctive purple claw), is a species of land hermit crab native to the west Atlantic, Bahamas, Belize, southern Florida,[3] Venezuela, the Virgin Islands, and the West Indies.[4] Adults burrow and hide under the roots of large trees, and can be found a considerable distance inland.[3] As with other terrestrial crabs, they utilize modified gills to breathe air. Their shell helps maintain the humidity necessary for gas exchange to function.[5]
