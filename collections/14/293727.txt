Manuel Alberto "Manny" Delgado (Rico Rodriguez), Gloria's son from her first marriage to Javier, is very outgoing and not the least bit self-conscious,[22] although he has become somewhat self-conscious in Season 5. He is very intelligent, probably second after Alex, but much in a street smart way. He is also mature and intuitive for his age and is often shown doing adult-like things, such as having conversations with Claire about her marriage and kids, and drinking coffee. He even engaged in stock market business and briefly considered following in his biological father's footsteps by becoming a professional gambler.[22]
