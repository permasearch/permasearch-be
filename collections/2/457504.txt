Therefore, in March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56×45mm cartridge.[56] This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the middle of the 1970s, other armies were looking at assault rifle type weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977.[56] The U.S. offered the 5.56×45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor.[20] In the end, the Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 round was chosen (STANAG 4172) in October 1980.[56] The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).[20]
