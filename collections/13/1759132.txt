Sonic the Hedgehog is an American comic book series published by Archie Comics, in partnership with Sega. The series is based on Sega's video game franchise as well as DiC Entertainment's 1993 animated series of the same name. After initially beginning with a four issue miniseries between 1992-93, the first full-length issue of the comic was published in July 1993. The series ran for 290 issues for over 20 years, earning a place in the 2008 Guinness World Records for being the "longest-running comic series based on a video game",[1] before it was confirmed canceled in July 2017 (although the comics ceased release in January), following Sega and Archie Comics' decision to discontinue their business relationship.[2] The series features a cast of hundreds of characters, consisting of those derived from the Sonic games and those original to the comics, with stories focused on a crime-fighting organization called the Freedom Fighters, led by Sonic, as they face off against series antagonist Doctor Eggman alongside a variety of other villains.
