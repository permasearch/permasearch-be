In the first edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties based on continent and[dubious – discuss] skin colour: "Europæus albus" (white European), "Americanus rubescens" (red American), "Asiaticus fuscus" (brown Asian) and "Africanus niger" (black African).[not in citation given][page needed] In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed phenotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity,[dubious – discuss] and changed the description of Asians' skin tone to "luridus" (yellow).[176] Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon "monstrosus" for "wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people".[177]
