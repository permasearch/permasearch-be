Escape from Butcher Bay's gameplay was compared to first-person shooters like Far Cry and Half-Life,[63][64] and to stealth game series like Splinter Cell,[17] Metal Gear,[8] and Thief.[63] Reviewers enjoyed the variety of gameplay elements:[15][35] Game Informer's Jeremy Zoss noted that "every aspect of play is expertly implemented",[48] and GameSpot's Greg Kasavin believed that the game "effectively and innovatively combines excellent shooting, hand-to-hand combat, stealth, and adventure elements".[49] While the game's stealth mechanics were praised,[15][63] certain critics received its first-person shooter elements with less enthusiasm.[64][65] Reviewers applauded the control scheme, such as the Xbox version's analog stick-based hand-to-hand combat.[2][15][48][64] The implementation of Riddick's eyeshine ability was also generally praised,[63][66] but Computer and Video Games believed that it was no different from night vision goggles in other first-person shooters, and said that it "could've been developed into so much more."[8]
