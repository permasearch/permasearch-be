Under the Portuguese energy policy, feed-in tariffs are offered to renewable sources (except large hydro) as well as micro distributed generation (e.g. solar PV, wind), waste and co-generation, and CHP generation from renewable and non-renewable sources, with the oldest tariffs dating back to 1998.[96] The highest feed-in tariff is for photovoltaics, starting at over 500 €/MWh in 2003, and later decreasing to 300 €/MWh; most of the other tariffs have steadily increased and stabilized at between 80 and 120 €/MWh.[96] The Portuguese policy was found to have positive impacts over the period 2000-2010, with a reduction in emissions of 7.2 MtCO2eq, an increase in GDP of 1557M€, and a creation of 160 thousand job-years.[97] Long term impacts are yet to be evaluated as tariffs have not yet expired for the earliest installations.[97]
