where     Λ Ω Λ    ′   + I − d i a g ( Λ Ω Λ    ′   )   {\displaystyle \Lambda \Omega \Lambda {'}+I-diag(\Lambda \Omega \Lambda {'})}   is the variance-covariance matrix implied by the proposed factor analysis model and     R   {\displaystyle R}   is the observed variance-covariance matrix.[6] That is, values are found for freed model parameters that minimizes the difference between the mode-implied variance-covariance matrix and observed variance-covariance matrix.
