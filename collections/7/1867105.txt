Traditionally, jeans were dyed to a blue color using natural indigo dye. Most denim is now dyed using synthetic indigo. Approximately 20Â thousand tons of indigo are produced annually for this purpose, though only a few grams of the dye are required for each pair.[23] For other colors of denim other dyes must be used. Currently, jeans are produced in any color that can be achieved with cotton.
