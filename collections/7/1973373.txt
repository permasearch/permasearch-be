In another context, Sanskara refers to the diverse rites of passage in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.[2][6][7] In Hinduism, the sanskaras vary in number and details according to regional traditions. They range from the list of 40 sanskaras in the Gautama Dharmasutra from about the middle of 1st millennium BCE,[8] to 16 sanskaras in the Grhyasutra texts from centuries later.[1][9] The list of sanskaras in Hinduism include both external rituals such as those marking a baby's birth and a baby's name giving ceremony, as well as inner rites of resolutions and ethics such as compassion towards all living beings and positive attitude.[8]
