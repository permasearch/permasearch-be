The Islamic city also hosts a national park, the Sacred Mountain National Park which spans the barangays of Guimba and Papandayan covering an area of 94-hectare (230-acre). The protected area was established on August 5, 1965 by Republic Act no. 4190.[8] The park is dominated by Mount Mupo, a 900-foot (270Â m) tall[9] extinct volcanic cone. The park is ideal for birdwatching and mountain climbing to the summit that features a small pond.[10]
