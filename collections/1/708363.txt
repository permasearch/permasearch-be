Despite animosity between the houses, their respective ghosts get along rather well with each other. Nearly Headless Nick speaks fondly of the Bloody Baron and claims that he cannot imagine starting a fight with him, while the Fat Friar pleads on behalf of Peeves the Poltergeist to allow him to come to the welcome feasts despite his past wrongdoings.  During The Deathly Hallows, Nick is protective of Helena and only reluctantly tells Harry how to find her.
