Nuclear reactors are the major source of human-generated neutrinos. The majority of energy in a nuclear reactor is generated by fission (the four main fissile isotopes in nuclear reactors are 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 241Pu), the resultant neutron-rich daughter nuclides rapidly undergo additional beta decays, each converting one neutron to a proton and an electron and releasing an electron antineutrino (n → p + e− + ν e). Including these subsequent decays, the average nuclear fission releases about 6989320435297400000♠200 MeV of energy, of which roughly 95.5% is retained in the core as heat, and roughly 4.5% (or about 6988144195883830000♠9 MeV)[87] is radiated away as antineutrinos. For a typical nuclear reactor with a thermal power of 7009400000000000000♠4000 MW,[nb 4] the total power production from fissioning atoms is actually 7009418500000000000♠4185 MW, of which 7008185000000000000♠185 MW is radiated away as antineutrino radiation and never appears in the engineering. This is to say, 7008185000000000000♠185 MW of fission energy is lost from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically without interaction.
