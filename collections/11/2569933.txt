The Northeast Corridor Line is a commuter rail line operated by New Jersey Transit along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor in the United States. It is the successor to Pennsylvania Railroad trains between Trenton Transit Center and New York Penn Station. After arrival at New York Penn Station, some trains load passengers and return to New Jersey, while others continue east to Sunnyside Yard for storage. Most servicing is done at the Morrisville Yard, at the west end of the line. The Northeast Corridor Line is colored red on New Jersey Transit system maps and its symbol is the State House. The Princeton Branch is a shuttle service connecting to the line.
