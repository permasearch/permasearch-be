The New Testament also uses the phrase te mia ton sabbaton ("the first day of the week") both for the early morning (Mary Magdalene John 20:1) and evening (the disciples in John 2:19) of Resurrection Sunday, as well as for the breaking of bread at Troas (Acts 20:7) and the day for the collection at Corinth (1 Co 16:2).[4]
