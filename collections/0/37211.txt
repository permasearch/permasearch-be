Chilliwack is a Canadian rock band centered on the singer and guitarist Bill Henderson, which started off with a more Progressive rock sound that incorporated elements of folk, jazz, and blues, before moving towards a more straight-ahead hard rock/pop rock sound by the mid-70s. They were active from 1970 to 1988, while Henderson reformed the band in 1997. Their six best-selling songs were "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)",[3] "I Believe", "Whatcha Gonna Do", "Fly At Night", "Crazy Talk", and "Lonesome Mary". The band's lineup has changed many times while they have continued to tour across Canada.
