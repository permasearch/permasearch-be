The term United Kingdom national (sometimes referred to as British national), is used differently in various statutes, but most commonly means British Citizens, British Overseas Territories Citizens, British Overseas Citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), (and usually) British Subjects (as defined in the 1981 Act) and British Protected Persons. British Protected Persons are an especial grey area; they are neither Commonwealth citizens (i.e., British subjects in the old sense), nor aliens. Though they are not traditionally considered British nationals, since they are not considered stateless under international law, they must be nationals of the United Kingdom.
