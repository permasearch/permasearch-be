Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers.[4] Promotion was helped by Rosie O'Donnell, who had shown the toy on her popular TV show in early October.[5][6] O'Donnell's "surprise plug" created unexpected demand for Elmo, resulting in shortages in the stores that sold it.[7]
