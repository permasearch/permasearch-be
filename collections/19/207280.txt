At 107 grams (3.8Â oz), the spider monkey brain is twice the size of the brain of a howler monkey of equivalent body size;[32] this is thought to be a result of the spider monkeys' complex social system and their frugivorous diets, which consist primarily of ripe fruit from a wide variety (over 150 species) of plants. This requires the monkeys to remember when and where fruit can be found. The slow development may also play a role: the monkeys may live from 20[33] to 27 years or more, and females give birth once every 17 to 45 months.[34] Gummy, presumably the oldest living spider monkey in captivity, is presumed to have been born wild in 1962 and currently resides at Fort Rickey Childrens Discovery Zoo located in Rome, NY.[35]
