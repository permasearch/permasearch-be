Hathaway, by contrast, actively sought the part, tracing "Hire me" in the sand of the zen garden on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, she knew she was not the studio's first choice and had to be patient[7] (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead).[6] Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies.[2] She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects.[19] She celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part.[7]
