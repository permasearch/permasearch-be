It usually consists of polysaccharides,[2] but can be composed of other materials such as polypeptide D-glutamic acid in B. anthracis, and peptidoglycan and muramic acid found in E.coli bacterial capsule. Because most capsules are so tightly packed, they are difficult to stain because most standard stains cannot adhere to the capsule. For examination under the microscope, the bacteria and their background are stained darker than the capsule, which doesn't stain. When viewed, bacterial cells as well as the surface they are on, are stained dark, while the capsule remains pale or colorless and appears as a ring, or halo, around the cell.[3]
