On June 4, 2007, Stewart and Ku. Busch had another altercation on pit road in the Autism Speaks 400 at Dover. Ku. Busch passed Stewart on the inside and then slid up, which caused contact, sending him into the wall, knocking out Ku. Busch, but with Stewart staying in the race. Initially it was thought that Stewart intentionally crashed Ku. Busch since they were bitter rivals over the year and that Stewart and Ku. Busch had contact early in the race. Under the caution, Stewart was on pit road and his crew was surveying the massive damage he received from the crash; when an enraged Ku. Busch pulled alongside and gave Stewart a profane gesture to express his feelings over the incident. One of Stewart's pitcrew members jumped out of the way of Ku. Busch's car to avoid being hit and Ku. Busch was disqualified. Stewart was put on temporary probation for his part in the feud but was cleared from any further penalties.
