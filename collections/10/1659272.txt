The shilling is a unit of currency formerly used in Austria, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, and other British Commonwealth countries. Currently the shilling is used as a currency in four east African countries: Kenya (Kenyan shilling), Tanzania (Tanzanian shilling), Uganda (Ugandan shilling), and Somalia ((Somali shilling)), as well as in the autonomous Somali region of Somaliland (Somaliland Shilling). It is also the proposed currency that the east African community plans to introduce (east African shilling). The word shilling comes from old English "Scilling", a monetary term meaning twentieth of a pound, and from the Proto-Germanic root *skiljaną meaning 'to separate.' The word "Scilling" is mentioned in the earliest recorded Germanic law codes those of Æthelberht of Kent.
