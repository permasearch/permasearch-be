Grace, the Hekes' 13-year-old daughter, keeps a journal in which she chronicles events, as well as stories she tells her younger siblings. Her best friend is a homeless boy named Toot, who lives in a wrecked car. She despises the future she believes is inevitable and is constantly reminded of getting married and playing the role of a wife, which she believes comprises catering to one's husband's demands and taking beatings. She dreams of leaving, and being independent and single.
