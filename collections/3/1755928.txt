In January 2005, Rimes released her seventh studio album, This Woman, her first album of contemporary country music in many years.[9] Although the album received mixed reviews from magazines and critics, it was Rimes's best-selling album in over five years,[48] reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in 2005,[49] selling more than 100,000 copies within its first week. Rimes explained to the Chicago Sun-Times that the album helped mature her as a person, "I have 10 years of experience, so it's tough to get anything past me in this business. I've become a very strong woman because of all I've gone through, good and bad."[15] This Woman would eventually be certified "Gold" later in 2005, after selling more than 500,000 units nationwide.[29] The album's singles were Rimes's first Top 10 hits on the Hot Country Songs chart in five years. The three singles released from the album—"Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense", "Probably Wouldn't Be This Way", and "Something's Gotta Give"—all peaked within the Top 5 on the country charts between 2005 and 2006.[14] From the album, Rimes was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for "Something's Gotta Give". In addition, she was also nominated for an American Music Award for "Favorite Female Country Artist." In 2006, Rimes recorded a cover version of Barbara Mandrell's "If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)", for a tribute album to Mandrell's career titled, She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool: A Tribute to Barbara Mandrell.[29] Rimes also would record a track for Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration album titled, "Remember When."[10]
