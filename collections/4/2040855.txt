In 2017, the Irish bounced back from a 4-8 season by going 10-3, including a win over the LSU Tigers in the Citrus Bowl. The Irish were seen as playoff contenders the majority of the season despite a 20-19 loss against the Georgia Bulldogs, who went on to win the SEC Championship. The Irish continued to do well on the back of running back Josh Adams, who was seen as a Heisman Trophy hopeful. The Irish were 8-1, before dropping 2 of their last 3 games to Miami, and Stanford. The Irish had two players drafted in the top 10 of the 2018 NFL Draft. Quenton Nelson to the Indianapolis Colts, and Mike McGlinchey to the San Francisco 49ers
