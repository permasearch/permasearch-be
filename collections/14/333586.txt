Mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father, and was torn between concern for him and duty to her husband, but was convinced that her husband's actions, however unpleasant, were necessary to "save the Church and State".[40] When Mary travelled to England after the New Year, she wrote of her "secret joy" at returning to her homeland, "but that was soon checked with the consideration of my father's misfortunes".[41] William ordered her to appear cheerful on their triumphant arrival in London. As a result, she was criticised, by John Evelyn and Sarah Churchill, for appearing cold to her father's plight.[42] James, too, wrote a diatribe against her criticising her disloyalty, an action which deeply affected the pious Mary.[43]
