While it may appear clear, in retrospect, that the automotive/suburban culture would continue to flourish, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, no such certainty existed at the time when British architect Martin Pawley authored his seminal work, The Private Future (1973).  Pawley called the automobile “the shibboleth of privatization; the symbol and the actuality of withdrawal from the community” and perceived that, in spite of its momentary misfortunes, its dominance in North American society would continue.  The car was a private world that allowed for fantasy and escape, and Pawley forecasted that it would grow in size, and in technological capacities.  He saw no pathology in consumer behavior grounded in freedom of expression.
