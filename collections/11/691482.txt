The Governor of South Dakota occupies the executive branch of the state government.[121] The current governor is Dennis Daugaard, a Republican from Garretson. The state constitution gives the governor the power to sign into law or veto bills passed by the state legislature, to serve as commander-in-chief of the South Dakota National Guard, to appoint a cabinet, and to commute criminal sentences or to pardon those convicted of crimes.[122][123] The governor serves for a four-year term, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms.[124]
