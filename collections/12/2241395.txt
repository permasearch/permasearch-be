Some behaviourists, such as John B. Watson, claim that stimulusâ€“response models provide a sufficient explanation for animal behaviours that have been described as emotional, and that all behaviour, no matter how complex, can be reduced to a simple stimulus-response association.[8] Watson described that the purpose of psychology was "to predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place; or given the reaction, state what the situation or stimulus is that has caused the reaction".[8] Other behaviourists[who?] further question whether animals feel emotions on the grounds that emotions are not universal even among humans, that interpretations of animal behaviour are anthropomorphic, and that definitions of emotions lack robustness.[citation needed]
