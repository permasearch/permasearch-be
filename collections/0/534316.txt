The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the 1960s.[14] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted the ANSI symbols in 1970.[15] The current standard was revised in 1985.[16] Generally, flowcharts flow from top to bottom and left to right.[17]
