Due to the lack of belligerent invaders, the PRNG has participated in a number of functions such as coordination during natural disasters (mainly tropical storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts) repairing roads, bridges, telecommunication arrays and aqueducts.[9] The PRNG also hosts other disciplines, including a band and a religious services branch that includes personal if different credos.[10] Through these, the organization also related with other government agencies and entities, occasionally organizing parades or friendly competitions or entertainment through its artistic unit, Banda 248.[9] Otherwise, the organization makes donations to other initiatives, mainly the Red Cross and similar entities.[9]
