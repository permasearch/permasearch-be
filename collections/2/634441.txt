In October 2002, the team elected to extend Chaney's contract for another year.[71] Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the preceding years.[72][73] Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president.[72][74] McDyess injured his knee during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery.[73] The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which they completed with a 37â€“45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.[75]
