The Detour was a choice between Alphabetized or Synchronized. In Alphabetized, teams went to the Russian State Library and were given a list of books by author, title, and year. They had to use the paper card catalog system, in Russian, to locate four of the books on the list. Once they thought they had the correct location in the stacks, a librarian would direct them to the proper room to allow the team to get the books. Teams then checked their retrieved books with the head librarian to get their next clue. In Synchronized, teams participated in a synchronized swimming routine with six other swimmers of the Russian national developmental team. After practicing the routine, they performed it for a judge â€“ who would either pass them and give them their next clue, or would require the teams to practice more. In both detours, there was a time limit depending on the operating hours of each facility; if they were unable to complete either task before the facilities closed, they would incur a 4-hour penalty (with the Synchronize detour operating longer than the Alphabetize Detour).
