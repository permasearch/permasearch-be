Low economic growth in central England led to a violent youth subculture.[6] Poor youths frequently robbed and pickpocketed men walking on the streets of slum Birmingham. These efforts were executed through assaults, beatings, stabbings, and manual strangulation.[10] During the 1890s, youth street gangs consisted of men between the ages of twelve and thirty.[11] The late 1890s saw the organisation of these men into a soft hierarchy.[12] The most powerful member of the Peaky Blinders was known as Kevin Mooney. His real name was Thomas Gilbert; however, he routinely changed his last name. Many of the land grabs undertaken by the gang were initiated by him. The most violent of these youth street gangs organised themselves as a singular group known as the "Peaky Blinders." After select gangsters attacked a man in 1890, they sent a letter to various national newspapers declaring themselves as members of this specific group.[10] Their first activities primarily revolved around occupying favourable land, notably the communities of Small Heath and Cheapside, Birmingham.[6] Their expansion was noted by their first gang rival, the "Cheapside Sloggers," who battled against them in an effort to control land.[13] The Sloggers originated in the 1870s known for street fights in the Bordesley, and Small Heath areasâ€“extremely poor slums of Birmingham. In 1899, an Irish police constable was contracted to enforce local law in Birmingham. However, police corruption and bribery diminished the effectiveness of his enforcement.[10]
