The phrase dormit in pace (English: "he sleeps in peace") was found in the catacombs of the early Christians and indicated that "they died in the peace of the Church, that is, united in Christ."[4][5][6] The acronym R.I.P., meaning Requiescat in pace "Rest in peace", continues to be engraved on the gravestones of Christians,[7] especially in the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican denominations.[8]
