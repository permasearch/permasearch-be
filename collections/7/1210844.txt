Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the coming of the harvest season. The specific moves of Bhangra reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The folk dance has been popularised in the western world by Punjabis in England, Canada and the USA where competitions are held.[70] It is seen in the West as an expression of South Asian culture as a whole.[71] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe â€“ including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and cultural shows.
