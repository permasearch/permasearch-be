The next season saw the arrival of the franchise's first superstar, Byron "Whizzer" White. The Pirates selected White, the All-America quarterback from the University of Colorado, with the fourth overall selection of the 1938 NFL Draft and offered him an unheard of salary of $15,000 (around $260,000 today) to join the team. White declined the generous offer, in order to continue his education through a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University.[43] However, when he was able to arrange to defer his start at Oxford until January, he reconsidered and signed the deal.[44] In addition to the league-high salary,[45] the terms of the deal also included a share of the gate at exhibition games for White,[46] who earned a total of $15,800 (around $270,000 today).[47] In comparison, McNally who served as both coach and player earned just $3,500 (roughly $61,000 today).[45] The big contract Rooney gave White angered several of his fellow owners.[45]
