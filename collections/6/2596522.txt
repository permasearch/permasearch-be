Michal goes on a series of increasingly unsuccessful dates: first with a man (Udi Persi) who has taken a vow not to look at anyone who is not his wife, next with a deaf man (Jonathan Rozen) who becomes angered that she only agreed to see him after falling into despair, and he senses she is flirting with his sign language interpreter. Michal later makes the pilgrimage to the grave of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov where she is overcome with grief and cries aloud that she cannot feel God. The grave of Rabbi Nachman where she has been praying is separated between men and women, and a man on the other side of the barrier overhears Michal and asks her if she is alright. The man reveals himself outside the grave to be Yoss (Oz Zehavi), an Israeli pop star who Michal is a fan of. During their conversation Michal reveals that she is planning to get married on the last day of Hanukkah but has yet to find a groom and invites Yoss to her wedding.
