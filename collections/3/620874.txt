In the Roman Rite, the Gloria Patri is frequently chanted or recited in the Liturgy of the Hours or Divine Office principally at the end of psalms and canticles and in the responsories. It also figures in the Introit of the pre-1970 form of Mass in the Roman Rite. It is restored to the Introit in the form of the Roman Rite published in Divine Worship: The Missal. The prayer also figures prominently in non-liturgical devotions, notably the rosary, where it is recited on the large beads (where also an "Our Father" is prayed) that separate the five sets of ten smaller beads, called decades, upon each of which a Hail Mary is prayed.
