From the time of the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) until the later, fuller implementation of the imperial examination system, most appointments in the imperial bureaucracy were based on recommendations from prominent aristocrats and local officials whilst recommended individuals were predominantly of aristocratic rank. Their names were sent by local officials to the central government based on reputations and abilities, which were sometimes judged subjectively. Oral examination on policy issues were sometimes conducted personally by the emperor himself, during Western Han.[5]
