The practice squad has also been used by the NFL and their teams as a way to bring in and train players from outside the United States or Canada, where gridiron football is not a popular sport. The NFL has operated programs in which selected international players were assigned to teams' practice squads as an extra member who did not count towards a team's maximum practice squad size.
