Evidence has suggested that cannabis was present in Egypt since circa 3000 BP.[3] However, whether or not it was used for psychoactive purposes during this time has not been documented.[3] It was stated in a book written in 1980 that cannabis cultivation has occurred in Egypt for "almost a thousand years".[3] During this time, cannabis was used for making rope and it was also cultivated for use as a drug.[3] Cannabis has been utilized in Egypt for hashish production for at least the last "eight or nine centuries".[3]
