Tony Trihull (voiced by Lloyd Sherr) is a combat ship (modelled after USS Independence (LCS-2)) who works for Professor Zündapp. He first appears in the beginning when he notices Crabby and Finn in the oil reserve, ordering Crabby to leave. When Crabby refuses, Tony threatens him with a missile battery (based on the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile). As a result, Crabby leaves but Finn hitches a ride on the back of Tony without him knowing. He later appears again near the end of the film in London when Professor Z tries to escape from being caught by Finn McMissile, yelling for the Professor to hurry and get aboard him. When Finn McMissile stops the Professor, Tony uses a magnetic device pulling the Professor to him. McMissile uses several mini-bombs out of his wheels on Tony, killing him.
