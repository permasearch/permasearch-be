A suspension of uncooked imitation custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, allowing the demonstration of "walking on custard"; see the physical properties of custard powder. Starch is often added into custard to serve as a safety net from overcooking and to prevent premature curdling. The starch granules behave as a heat buffer in the mixture. Granules slowly hydrate and absorb heat in order to maintain a constant rate of heat transfer. Along with preventing the formation of curds, starches help improve the smooth texture and thick mouthfeel.[9]
