Albany's initial architecture incorporated many Dutch influences, followed soon after by those of the English.[141] Quackenbush House, a Dutch Colonial brick mansion, was built c. 1736;[142] Schuyler Mansion, a Georgian-style mansion, was built in 1765;[143] and the oldest building in Albany is the 1728 Van Ostrande-Radliff House at 48 Hudson Avenue.[144] Albany's housing varies greatly, with mostly row houses in the older sections of town, closer to the river. Housing type quickly changes as one travels westward, beginning with two-family homes of the late 19th century, and one-family homes built after World War II in the western end of the city.[145]
