To do this, Comstock drafted a new federal bill and with the sponsorship of Representative Clinton L. Merriam, he met with members of the House and proved his point by exhibiting obscene materials. Through past connections, Comstock got Justice William Strong to introduce the bill to William Windom, a senator from Minnesota, to take the bill to the floor of the Senate. While the bill was undergoing further revision, a provision was coordinated in a federal appropriations bill. This provision was authorized by Congress, which essentially created a new positionâ€”special agent in the United States Post Office. This position held the power to confiscate immoral materials sent in the mail and arrest those that were sending it.[1]
