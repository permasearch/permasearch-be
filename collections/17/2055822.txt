On 12 June 2015, Tom Searle announced that the band started demoing new songs and he was excited for the release of a seventh album. On 6 March 2016, Epitaph Records released a new Architects song, "A Match Made in Heaven".[63] It is the first single from All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us, which was released on 27 May. On 11 April, Architects released a second single, "Gone with the Wind". On March 23, Architects announced a release show in Brighton for May 27, supported by Counting Days.[64] Due to unexpectedly high demand, the ticket website accidentally oversold tickets, prompting the band to add a second date on May 28. Architects premiered a third song, "Downfall", on May 20.[65] On the same day, they announced a headline tour in the United Kingdom for November 2016.[66] Architects also played a number of shows in mainland Europe and in North America during the summer. It has been stated by Tom Searle that it is "a bunch of atheists thinking about whether or not there might be something bigger," and that due to his cancer he was becoming highly contemplative about life, and that this album is the product of that train of thought.
