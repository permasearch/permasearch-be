The historical role that Damascus played as an important trade center has changed in recent years due to political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade.[78] Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula.[78] Damascus has also held an annual international trade exposition every fall, since 1954.[79]
