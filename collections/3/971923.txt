Filmmaker Spike Lee, in an interview with Vibe, said he would not see the film, explaining "All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just meÂ ... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else."[70] Lee later wrote, "American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them."[71] Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, interpreted the movie as "preparation for race war".[72]
