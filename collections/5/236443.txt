In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single "Prayin' for Daylight", a song that had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed.[6] The song, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard country charts, was the first single from their self-titled debut, which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street.[1] Following "Prayin' for Daylight", the album's other three singles all made top ten on that chart: "This Everyday Love", "While You Loved Me", and "I'm Movin' On", which respectively peaked at No. 9, 7, and 4. "I'm Movin' On" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the album with favor, calling it "a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album".[7]
