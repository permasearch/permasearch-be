Konishiki Yasokichi (小錦八十吉, Konishiki Yasokichi, born Saleva'a Fuauli Atisano'e; December 31, 1963) is a Hawaiian-born Japanese-Samoan former sumo wrestler.[1] He was the first non-Japanese-born wrestler to reach ōzeki, the second-highest rank in the sport. During his career he won the top division championship on three occasions and came close to becoming the first foreign-born grand champion, or yokozuna, prompting a debate as to whether a foreigner could have the necessary cultural understanding to be acceptable in sumo's ultimate rank. At a peak weight of 287 kg (633 lb) he was also the heaviest wrestler ever in sumo, earning him the nicknames "Meat Bomb" and "Dump Truck".[1][2][3]
