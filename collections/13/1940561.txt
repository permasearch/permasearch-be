Most historians favour a site in the Midlands, probably along the Roman road of Watling Street between Londinium and Viroconium (Wroxeter in Shropshire), now the A5. Plausible suggestions include Manduessedum (Mancetter), near Atherstone in Warwickshire,[20] a site close to High Cross in Leicestershire,[21] and a small dip at Cuttle Mill, two miles southeast of Lactodorum (Towcester) in Northamptonshire, where human bones have been found over a wide area.[22][23] In 2009 Arbury Banks, near Ashwell (Herts.)[24] was suggested as a location.
