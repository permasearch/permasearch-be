Ninth Judicial District Attorney Matthew Chandler announced August 3, 2009 that Robin Kirven, age 40, and Samantha Wallace, age 21, was convicted of Harboring a Felon.  The incident stems from August 24, 2008, when Michael England, along with seven other jail inmates escaped from the Curry County Detention Center. England was awaiting trial for Tampering with Evidence in a murder investigation when he escaped from jail. Michael England was apprehended by local authorities on October 13, 2008 after Clovis Police Department received a Crime Stoppers Tip stating that England was at the apartment of Samantha Wallace. Officers responded to the call and at the apartment, spoke with Robin Kirven and Samantha Wallace, who both denied that England was at the residence. After a thorough search was conducted of the apartment, authorities found England hiding between a bed and wall in a back bedroom. Michael England was apprehended and both women were charged with Harboring a Felon. The Honorable Robert Orlik presided over the sentencing and Chief Deputy District Attorney Andrea Reeb prosecuted the case for the State. At sentencing, the Court ordered that Robin Kirven and Samantha Wallace serve one year in the Curry County Adult Detention Center, followed by six months of intensively supervised parole.[50]
