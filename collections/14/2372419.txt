A number of cures and favours are associated with visitors to Our Lady of Knockâ€™s Shrine and those who claim to have been cured here still leave crutches and sticks at the spot where the apparition is believed to have occurred.[7] Each Irish diocese makes an annual pilgrimage to the Marian Shrine and the nine-day Knock novena attracts ten thousand pilgrims every August.[8] The miracle is also known as Our Lady of Knock by the church.
