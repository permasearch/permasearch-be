By the beginning of March 2017, Michael Shannon had been in the running to portray Cable, but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict.[42] David Harbour had screen-tested for the role,[43] and Pierce Brosnan was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film, potentially Cable.[44] Reynolds announced shortly after that Zazie Beetz had been cast as Domino.[10] Later in the month, Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again, and was considered the frontrunner, with Fox also looking at a shortlist of other actors that included Harbour.[45] Brad Pitt had also been considered for the role, and expressed interest in taking it, but had "moved on".[46] Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors, saying Shannon "would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens, I would be through the roof";[47] and on Pitt, "We had a great meeting with Brad, he was incredibly interested in the property. Things didn't work out schedule-wise. He's a fan, and we love him, and I think he would've made an amazing Cable."[48] At the end of March, Morena Baccarin confirmed her return from the first film as Vanessa, and expressed interest in exploring the character's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel.[7] Josh Brolin emerged as a "surprise contender" to play Cable in April, ahead of Shannon and Harbour, and was officially cast in the role. Brolin also portrays the Marvel Comics character Thanos, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[4] Leslie Uggams confirmed that she would be reprising her role of Blind Al from the first film,[20] while Fox gave the sequel a June 1, 2018 release date.[49]
