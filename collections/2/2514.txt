In season six, Elena begins medical school, unable to set foot in her hometown. She is unable to recover from Damon's death and lurks at the edges of Mystic Falls â€“ preying on people, drinking their blood, and compelling them to forget. As spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk. Elena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, and he eventually succeeds. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again, and starts dating classmate Liam. After Damon comes back to life, Elena eventually decides to have the compulsion undone, but Alaric crosses into Mystic Falls and becomes human again. Elena is then left to face Damon and see if her feelings will return. Bonnie returns from the prison world with the cure to immortality which Elena takes, hoping to have family with Damon. However, in the season finale, Kai links Bonnie's life to Elena's, putting her in a magical sleep until Bonnie's dies.
