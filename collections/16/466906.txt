In the village of Gavaldon, every 4 years, two children of either gender at age 12 and older are kidnapped away by an unseen force into the surrounding Woods, whereupon new books would appear the next day in the village bookshop. From the stamps on the book boxes and the familiar faces in those fairytales every 4 years, it is deduced that the kidnapped children are spirited away to a "School for Good and Evil", where they train to be fairytale heroes and heroines or villains. While most children fear the unknown force, nicknamed "the School Master", pink-loving, beautiful Sophie dreams of being kidnapped to go to the School for Good, becoming a princess, and living out a Happily Ever After with a charming prince. Meanwhile, her best friend, Agatha, is the complete opposite of her, with her clumps, sulky attitude, and ugly face, as well as the fact that she lives on a graveyard, is deemed by the villagers to be a perfect candidate for the School for Evil. As the feared day every 4 years arrives again, Agatha attempts to drag Sophie back upon witnessing her capture, and both of them are transported to the schools.
