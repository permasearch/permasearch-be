In terms of the exclusive rights, different kinds of subject matter have different rights.  Owners of copyright in works have rights to reproduce, publish (meaning publish for the first time), perform, and adapt the work, and communicate it to the public (including broadcast, or communicate by making available online).  The rights of owners of copyright in artistic works are more limited (there is no right to control public display of artistic works).  Owners of copyright in other subject matter have the exclusive right to make copies, to communicate them to the public, and to cause them to be heard/seen in public.
