In the episode "Greensleeves", Bobby is caught and tortured by August's crew after SAMCRO attempted to blackmail him with an affidavit linking him to the murder of Pastor Johnathan Haddem. Marks' enforcer Moses Cartwright gouges out Bobby's right eye with a grapefruit spoon and sends it to Jax to show them Marks is still in control. In the episode "The Separation of Crows", Marks threatens to continuously cut body parts off of Bobby every 24 hours that they don't divulge where the construction site is where they buried Haddem's body. Bobby refuses to tell Moses anything only remarking that Moses can "suck his big white dick". Jax attempts to make a deal with Marks: The location of the body in exchange for Bobby. Moses remarks that Jax and the Sons made a mistake by thinking the deal was negotiable as Moses's men force Bobby to the ground and sever a number of his fingers on his clutch hand. In the episode "What A Piece of Work is Man" an exchange is set up between SAMCRO and August to trade the pastor's body and footage on a cell phone (which contained videos that Marks intended to use as leverage against the pastor's family) in exchange for Bobby. Jax and the pastor's son hand the body and phone over to August who brings a bound and gagged Bobby over, who attempts to warn Jax. Before Jax can understand him, August pulls out a gun he hid on Bobby and points it at Jax. He tells the son "If you or your mother ever get the idea to betray me, this is what happens." He then shoots Bobby in the head and leaves. Jax is crushed by Bobby's death, breaking out in tears and apologizing to his body.
