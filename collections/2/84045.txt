Today, the text is of a great value to modern historians and archaeologists.[1] The Records is an important document of Central Asia during the early seventh century, as it provides information of a Buddhist culture existing in Afghanistan during that time and the earliest textual evidence for Buddhist sculptures at Bamiyan.[2] The text also has equal importance in the studies of India, and archaeologists have been using it to fill in certain gaps in Indian history.[1] The book is known for having "exact descriptions of distances and locations of different places",[1] and has served as a guidebook for the excavation of many important sites, such as Rajagrha, the Temple at Sarnath, Ajanta, the ruins of the Nalanda Monastery in Bihar[1] and the ruins of Vasu Bihar of ancient Pundra City. The text inspired Journey to the West, a Chinese novel published in the Ming Dynasty.
