On the other side, on October 7, 2016, video and accompanying audio were released by The Washington Post in which Trump referred obscenely to women in a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush while they were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. The audio was met with a reaction of disbelief and disgust from the media.[226][227][228] Following the revelation, Trump's campaign issued an apology, stating that the video was of a private conversation from "many years ago".[229] The incident was condemned by numerous prominent Republicans like Reince Priebus, Mitt Romney, John Kasich, Jeb Bush[230] and the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[231] By October 8 several dozen Republicans had called for Trump to withdraw from the campaign and let Pence head the ticket.[232] Trump insisted he would never drop out.[233]
