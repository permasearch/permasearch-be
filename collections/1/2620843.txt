Fury is Sledge's ill-tempered oni general who wields a lightning-empowered Seven-Branched Sword in battle. Fury is the one who is usually sent to Earth to do Sledge's bidding, having been present to attempt to capture Keeper 65Â million years ago, only to accidentally bring a booby trapped bomb back with him to the ship, leaving him stranded on Earth as a result. Fury continually chased Keeper over the following millions of years, at one point capturing Sir Ivan of Zandar into his body[15] and also meeting Tyler's missing father, who managed to make a sketch of Fury in his journal before his disappearance.[1] Following the battle on Sledge's ship, Fury seemingly perishes with the rest of the crew after it crashes to Earth.[17] However, he is revealed to be among the survivors of the crash and soon takes his place as an enforcer under Heckyl/Snide and later Lord Arcanon.
