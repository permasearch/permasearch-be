Evans was born in New York City, in the Bronx, and is the seventh out of ten children born to Carol and Lonnie Evans. At one point she and her family had been living in their van for years. Evans got her first break on Showtime at the Apollo at the age of 9. In February 2003, in her Star Search appearance, Evans won the Grand Champion title in the junior singer division, becoming the only performer in Star Search history to receive perfect five scores on all of her appearances. In the competition, Evans competed against fellow singers Lisa Tucker and David Archuleta, who both later appeared on American Idol. Evans has starred in an episode of Law & Order: SVU, playing actor Blair Underwood's daughter. That same year, she sang for executives at Columbia Records and was offered a recording contract deal at 10 years old. With her musical career already on the upswing, she landed a small role on CBS's The District. In 2005, Evans made her feature film debut in Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman as Brian Simmons' daughter, played by Perry himself.[3] She also contributed to the movie soundtrack[4] on "Father, Can You Hear Me" featuring Cheryl Pepsii Riley, Tamela Mann, Terrell Carter, and Anya Washington.
