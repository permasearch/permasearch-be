In Omniverse, 11 year-old Ditto's head fins are white and the ones on the side are connected to his eyes. He also has two small spikes protruding from his cheeks. His fingers are now sharper and the green orbs on his shoulders are gone. He has bumps like the three on his waist on his shoulders and wrists. His neck is completely black. Ditto is about the height of an average human child. 16-year-old Ditto looks similar to his 11-year-old self. He has green fins now. His suit where it used to be black is now green, and he has green under his arms, on his shins, and around his waist.
