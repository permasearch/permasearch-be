Women had local votes in some provinces, as in Ontario from 1850, where women owning property (freeholders and householders) could vote for school trustees.[162] By 1900 other provinces had adopted similar provisions, and in 1916 Manitoba took the lead in extending women's suffrage.[163] Simultaneously suffragists gave strong support to the Prohibition movement, especially in Ontario and the Western provinces.[164][165]
