In February 2013, the Postal Service announced that on Saturdays it would only deliver packages, mail-order medicines, Priority Mail, and Express Mail, effective August 10, 2013.[44][45] However, this change was reversed by federal law in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013.[46] They now deliver packages on Sunday â€“ only for Amazon.com.[47] During the four weeks preceding Christmas since 2013, packages from all mail classes and senders were delivered on Sunday in some areas.[48]
