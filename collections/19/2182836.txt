Saskatchewan Highways 35 and 335 meet at a right-angle intersection near the village of Armley in the Rural Municipality of Connaught, Saskatchewan. The intersection is commonly known as "Armley Corner". Traffic on Highway 35, running north–south, has the right of way at the intersection and a speed limit of 100 km/h (60 mph).[8] Traffic on Highway 335, both westbound and eastbound, has a speed limit of 100 km/h (60 mph) dropping to 60km/h (35 mph) at the intersection, which has stop signs with flashing red lights.[9] The signal lights were installed after a fatal traffic collision at the same intersection in 1997 in which six members of a family from British Columbia were killed.[8][10] Six memorial crosses in the intersection's southeast corner commemorate those deaths.[11]
