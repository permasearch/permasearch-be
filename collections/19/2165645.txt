Many place names are named after Norwegian immigrants such as the Olsen- and Pedersen families.[46] The first Norwegians came from the village of Stranda by Storfjorden. Ole Anderson bought 199 acres here, while Lars Pederson owned 111 acres. Other Norwegian pioneers also included Ole Nilsen, George Hansen and Nils Olsen. A major contribution was the construction of the hand-made Norwegian Grade in 1911, a 1-mile road leading from Thousand Oaks to Santa Rosa Valley.[47]
