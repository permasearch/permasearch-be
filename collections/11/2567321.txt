Back on the Titanic, Captain Hardaker dismisses the ship's officers from the bridge. Citing regulations, that require at least two officers remain on the bridge at all times, Midshipman Alonso Frame stays. After the group returns from their excursion, Hardaker drops the vessel's protective shielding and magnetises the hull. This causes nearby meteors to be pulled toward the ship on a collision course. Midshipman Frame attempts to reactivate the shields but is shot by Hardaker as the meteors collide with the ship. The collision causes hull breaches, most of the 2,000 passengers and staff are killed, and the vessel begins plunging toward the Earth. The Doctor makes contact with the wounded Midshipman Frame, who stabilises and maintains the power from the damaged engines.
