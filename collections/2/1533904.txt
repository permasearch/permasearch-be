Since 1998 when the first expansion of the airport occurred (AIES II), the airport has been suffering from saturation in areas of check-in, screening, immigration and baggage as it continues to serve more than 2 million passengers arriving each year. In late 2012, CEPA began their rehabilitation, modernization and optimization project for the airport, which was completed in April 2015.
