The music video for "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?" was shot in Santa Ynez, California and directed by John Derek. It was filmed on December 19, 20 and 21, 1994 and released on January 2, 1995 on CMT. The video features Twain wearing a red dress, walking around in a smoky restaurant in the country. She interacts with various men in the restaurant, but she is invisible to them. These scenes are intercut with shots of her singing and playing guitar outside the restaurant. The video is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection.
