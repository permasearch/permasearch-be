It became not only the only party Iranians were permitted to belong to, but one the "whole adult population" was required to belong and pay dues to.[39] The party attempted to take a populist stand fining and jailing merchants in its "anti-profiteering" campaigns, but this proved not only economically harmful but also politically counterproductive. Inflation morphed into a black market and business activity declined. Merchants were angered and politicized.[40]
