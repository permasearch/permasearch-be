Bosch supplies the Valkyrie's ECU unit, traction control system, and ESP, and brakes and callipers are provided by Alcon and Surface Transforms. The front and rear lights are constructed by Wipac. The car features all-carbon fibre bodywork[21] and is installed with a carbon fibre Monocell from manufacturer Multimatic.[22] Michelin supplies the Valkyrie with the company's high-performance Sport Cup 2 tyres, with 265/35-ZR20 at the front and 325/30-ZR21 at the rear.[23] The wheels are constructed out of lightweight magnesium alloy (20" front, 21" rear) with race-spec centre-lock wheel nuts to reduce mass.
