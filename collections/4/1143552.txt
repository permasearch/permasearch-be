Mount Eden was founded in 1850 by a group of farmers from Mount Eden, Kentucky, drawn to California by the Gold Rush.[1] The party disbanded upon reaching the San Francisco Bay, but a few settled at a road crossing where they nailed a sign "Mt. Eden" to two trees, and the name stuck. A post office opened in 1860 and was in continuous operation until 1953.[1]
