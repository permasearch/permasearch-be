Later on Day 1, the remaining eight HouseGuests moved in. Julie called everyone into the backyard for the second group's HoH competition: Over the Coals. The goal was to be the last one to hold on to a large rotating stiff. The girls quickly fell, with Zach and Derrick soon following. Caleb won and became the second HoH. Julie informed the HouseGuests of how the dual-HoH twist would work: Frankie and Caleb would make separate nominations, meaning a total of four nominees on the block. Following the nominations, those four would compete as duos in the Battle of the Block competition. The duo that won the competition would be removed from the block and immune from being named the replacement nominee if the veto was used that week, whereas the HoH who nominated them would be dethroned and eligible to be the replacement nominee; meaning that the outgoing HOH could go from being HOH to being evicted within a week for the first time ever.
