Middle Sister, also known as "Hope", is a basaltic stratovolcano that has also erupted more-viscous andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite.[51] The smallest and least studied of the three, Middle Sister began eruptive activity 48,000 years ago,[52] and it was primarily built by eruptions occurring between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago.[44] One of the earliest major eruptive events (about 38,000 years ago) produced the rhyolite of Obsidian Cliffs on the mountain's northwestern flank.[53] Thick and rich in dacite, the flows extended from the northern and southern sides. They stand in contrast to older, andesitic lava remains that reach as far as 4.3 miles (7 km) from its base.[54]
