"Freakbeat" is a term sometimes given to certain British Invasion acts closely associated with the mod scene during the Swinging London period, particularly harder-driving British blues bands of the era that often remained obscure to US listeners, and who are sometimes seen as counterparts to the garage rock bands in America.[64][65] Certain acts, such as the Pretty Things and the Creation, had a certain degree of chart success in the UK and are often considered exemplars of the form.[66][67][68][69][excessive citations] The emergence of a relatively homogeneous worldwide "rock" music style marking the end of the "invasion" occurred in 1967.[9]
