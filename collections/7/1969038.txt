The myth tells how Patmos existed as an island at the bottom of the sea.[citation needed] Artemis frequently paid visits to Caria, the mainland across the shore from Patmos, where she had a shrine on Mount Latmos. There she met the moon goddess Selene, who cast her light on the ocean, revealing the sunken island of Patmos.[citation needed]
