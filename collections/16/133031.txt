On the evening of 12 September 2017, the House of Representatives of the Philippines voted 119-32 to give the CHR a budget of only ₱1,000 (~$25) for the entire year of 2018, which, if made law, would effectively abolish the commission.[7] The commission had reportedly asked Congress for a budget of ₱623,380,000 ($15,351,356), and it condemned the vote.[8] As of 13 September 2017[update], the budget had not been finalized and was still subject to further amendment before approval by the Senate of the Philippines and by the President.[9] If the Senate rejects the proposed CHR budget, such action will trigger a bicameral committee made of members of both houses to resolve the dispute.[10]
