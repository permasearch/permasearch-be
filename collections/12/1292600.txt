Kwouk was born in Warrington,[1][2] Cheshire, but was brought up in Shanghai. Between the ages of 12 and 16 he attended the Jesuit Mission School there, which he described as "the Far East equivalent of Eton".[1] He left China in 1947 when his Chinese parents returned to Britain and was then sent to the United States to complete his education.[3] In 1953 he graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.[4] The Kwouk family fortune had been lost in the 1949 revolution and in 1954 he came back to Britain, where a girlfriend "nagged [him] into acting".[3]
