According to the Allmusic review by Jose F. Promis, "The album never truly realized its full potential, but does include the song that would become one of Hyman's signature tunes, "You Know How to Love Me."[1] The song was never a blockbuster hit, but has grown into a classic, covered by artists such as Lisa Stansfield and Robin S". The album reached number ten on the R&B charts in 1980.[3] The single, "You Know How to Love Me" was a club smash reaching number six on the dance charts.[4]
