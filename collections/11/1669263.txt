A double-dotted note is a note with two small dots written after it. Its duration is ​1 3⁄4 times its basic note value. The double-dotted note is used less frequently than the dotted note. Typically, as in the example to the right, it is followed by a note whose duration is one-quarter the length of the basic note value, completing the next higher note value. Before the mid 18th century, double dots were not used. Until then, in some circumstances, single dots could mean double dots.[8]
