In 1992, the original mercury-arc equipment was paralleled to create a single pole (Pole 1), and a new thyristor-based pole (Pole 2) was commissioned alongside it. The transmission lines and submarine cables were also upgraded to double the link's maximum capacity to 1240Â MW. The mercury-arc valve converter equipment was partially decommissioned in 2007, and fully decommissioned in August 2012. Replacement thyristor converter stations (to be known as Pole 3) entered into service on 30 May 2013. Further work to Pole 2 will bring the link's capacity to 1200MW by the end of the year.[39]
