The debris field was described as "quite compact", measuring 200 by 600 metres (660 by 1,970 ft) and located a short distance north of where pieces of wreckage had been recovered previously, suggesting that the aircraft hit the water largely intact.[155] The French Ecology and Transportation Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet stated the bodies and wreckage would be brought to the surface and taken to France for examination and identification.[156] The French government chartered the Île de Sein to recover the flight recorders from the wreckage.[157][158] An American Remora 6000 remotely operated vehicle (ROV)[g] and operations crew from Phoenix International experienced in the recovery of aircraft for the United States Navy were on board the Île de Sein.[159][160]
