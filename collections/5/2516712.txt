Painful exposures to capsaicin-containing peppers are among the most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers.[59] They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm.[60]
