A reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,[85] while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.[106] A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that "it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside".[107] In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.[103][85]
