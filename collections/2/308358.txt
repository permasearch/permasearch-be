Quakerism gained a considerable following in England and Wales, and the numbers increased to a peak of 60,000 in England and Wales by 1680[26] (1.15% of the population of England and Wales).[26] However, the dominant discourse of Protestantism viewed the Quakers as a blasphemous challenge to social and political order,[27] leading to official persecution in England and Wales under the Quaker Act 1662 and the Conventicle Act 1664. This was relaxed after the Declaration of Indulgence (1687â€“1688) and stopped under the Act of Toleration 1689.
