Aircraft were equipped with dual cockpits for filming in flight.[75] A Yakovlev Yak-52TW[59][76] was modified to resemble a Supermarine Spitfire,[19][77] and two Supermarine Spitfire Mark IAs, a Spitfire Mark VB, and a Hispano Buchon painted to look like a Messerschmitt Bf 109E, were also used for the combat scenes. Large-scale radio controlled model aircraft, including Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 87 bombers, were filmed crashing into the English Channel.[10][74] The real Spitfires were provided by the Imperial War Museum Duxford,[16] and owner Dan Friedkin piloted the one that was shot landing on the beach in Dunkirk. These takes had to be done within forty-five minutes, before the tide came back in.[19] IMAX cameras were attached to the fighter planes using specially-made snorkel and periscope lenses – in the back and the front[9][10][19] – and large-scale mockups were submerged with cable rigs for a crash scene.[9] A Piper Aerostar enabled filming from the air, also with IMAX cameras front and rear. Dogfights over the Channel were shot by an aerial unit based at Lee-on-Solent Airfield.[19] Hardy and Lowden spent the final stages of the shooting schedule on a cliffside in Palos Verdes, inside purpose-built cockpit gimbals, with limited contact with the rest of the cast and crew.[9][16][19][78] Principal photography ended on 2 September 2016, after sixty-eight days.[19]
