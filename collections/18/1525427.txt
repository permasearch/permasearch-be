Laverne Cox has been noted by her LGBT peers, and many others, for being a trailblazer for the transgender community,[54] and has won numerous awards for her activist approach in spreading awareness. Her impact and prominence in the media has led to a growing conversation about transgender people,[55] specifically transgender women, and how being transgender intersects with one's race.[56] She is the first openly transgender person to be on the cover of Time magazine,[4] be nominated for a Primetime Emmy,[37] and have a wax work in Madame Tussauds,[9] as well as the first openly transgender woman to win a Daytime Emmy as an Executive Producer.[57] In May 2016, Cox was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School in New York City for her progressive work in the fight for gender equality.[58]
