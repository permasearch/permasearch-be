Volcanology of Iceland includes a high concentration of active volcanoes due to Iceland's location on the mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary, and also due to its location over a hot spot. The island has 30 active volcanic systems, of which 13 have erupted since the settlement of Iceland in AD 874.[1]
