At the tournament, Barnes reaches the final round to face Daniel. Silver and Kreese instruct Barnes to inflict pain on Daniel, keep the score a tie, and finally beat him in the sudden death round. During the fight, Barnes constantly gets the upper hand, taunting him each time. When the initial round concludes, a severely beaten Daniel tells Miyagi that he cannot continue, but Miyagi encourages him to carry on. In the sudden death round, Daniel performs the kata. When a confused Barnes lunges toward Daniel, Daniel flips him to the ground and strikes him to win the tournament. Disgusted and humiliated, Silver walks away from Kreese and the crowd throws their Cobra Kai shirts back at him, implying that Cobra Kai has been closed down forever. Miyagi bows to Daniel, but an over-excited Daniel tells him, "Forget about it!", and the two embrace in celebration.
