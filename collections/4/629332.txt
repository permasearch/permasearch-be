In November 2011, Supercell abandoned Gunshine for three reasons: it did not interest players for long enough, it was too difficult to play, and the mobile version did not work as well as the browser version. At best, the game had approximately half a million players. Supercell noticed the company could not catch up to the current leader of Facebook games, the Zynga company, and decided to focus on iPad games. Another Facebook game on development was left unfinished as well. The change of direction did not drive away the investors, but the pressure to succeed became worse, and Paananen had to make more detailed reports of progress for the investors.[14]
