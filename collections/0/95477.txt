Hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules (intermolecular) or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecular).[4] Depending on the nature of the donor and acceptor atoms which constitute the bond, their geometry, and environment, the energy of a hydrogen bond can vary between 1 and 40 kcal/mol.[5] This makes them somewhat stronger than a van der Waals interaction, and weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. This type of bond can occur in inorganic molecules such as water and in organic molecules like DNA and proteins.
