The Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago) comprises the first part of the Cenozoic, which during this time the continents assumed their modern shapes. The fragments of Gondwana (South America, Africa, India and Australia) began to drift northwards. The collision of India with the Eurasian landmass led to the folding and formation of the Himalayas. Similarly, the Alps were folded in Central Europe by the collision of the African plate with Europe. A land bridge between North America and South America did not yet exist. The Atlantic Ocean continued to widen during the Paleogene. In the North, the last land bridge between North America and Europe broke up during the Eocene. Climate during the Paleogene was warm and tropical as most time during the Mesozoic. The climate in the beginning was drier and cooler than in the preceding Cretaceous, but the temperature strongly increased during the Eocene and subtropical vegetation spread up to Greenland and Patagonia. The climate near the poles was cool temperate, in Europe, North America, Australia and the southern part of South America warm temperate. Near the equator there was tropical climate, flanked by hot and arid zones in the north and the south. In the Oligocene, global cooling started. Antarctica was covered by an ice sheet and subsequently, sea levels dropped. Except an intermittent warm period during the late Oligocene, global cooling continued and finally led to the Pleistocene ice age.[9]:402[17]
