In those who are otherwise healthy, there is little evidence that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease.[5][36] Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful.[36][37] Other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.[38]
