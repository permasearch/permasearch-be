Osteocytes have a stellate shape, approximately 7 micrometers deep and wide by 15 micrometers in length.[3] The cell body varies in size from 5-20 micrometers in diameter and contain 40-60 cell processes per cell,[4] with a cell to cell distance between 20-30 micrometers.[3] A mature osteocyte contains a single nucleus that is located toward the vascular side and has one or two nucleoli and a membrane.[5] The cell also exhibits a reduced size endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, and cell processes that radiate towards the mineralizing matrix.[5] Osteocytes form an extensive connecting syncitial network via small cytoplasmic/dendritic processes in canaliculi.[6]
