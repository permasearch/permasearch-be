Fernand and Danglar inform on Edmond regarding Bonaparte's letter. Villefort, the city's magistrate, has Edmond arrested, but initially prepares to exonerate Edmond until he learns the letter is addressed to Villefort's father, a Bonapartist. He burns the letter and orders Edmond imprisoned in Château d'If. Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand instead turns him over to the pursuing Gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac. Villefort has Fernand assassinate his father in exchange for persuading Mercédès that Edmond has been executed for treason and that she should take comfort in Fernand.
