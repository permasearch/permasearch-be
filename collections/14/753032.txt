Almost all modern critical translations include the pericope adulterae at John 7:53â€“8:11 (exceptions being the New English Bible and Revised English Bible, which relocate it after the end of the Gospel); but most others enclose it in brackets, and/or add a footnote mentioning the absence of the passage in the oldest witnesses (NRSV, NJB, NIV, GNT, NASB).
