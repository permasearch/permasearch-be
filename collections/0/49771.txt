USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) is a fictional starship in the fictional Star Trek universe that serves as both the main setting of the original Star Trek television series, as well as the primary transportation method for the show's characters. The Enterprise has been depicted in four network television series, six feature films, many books, and much fan-created media. The original Star Trek series (1966â€“1969) features a voice-over by Enterprise captain, James T. Kirk (William Shatner), which describes the mission of the Enterprise as "to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before".[6]
