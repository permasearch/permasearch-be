While nitromethane has a much lower energy density (11.2 MJ/kg) than either gasoline (44 MJ/kg) or methanol (22.7 MJ/kg), an engine burning nitromethane can produce up to 2.3 times more power than an engine burning gasoline. This is made possible by the fact that, in addition to fuel, an engine must burn oxygen in order to generate force: 14.7 kg of air (21% oxygen) is required to burn one kilogram of gasoline, compared to only 1.7 kg of air for one kilogram of nitromethane, which, unlike gasoline, already has oxygen in its molecular composition. This means that an engine can burn 8.7 times more nitromethane than gasoline.
