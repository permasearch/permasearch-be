Reddit's users are more privacy-conscious than on other websites, using tools like AdBlock and proxies,[150] and they hate "feeling manipulated by brands" but respond well to "content that begs for intelligent viewers and participants."[151] Lauren Orsini writes in ReadWrite that "Reddit's huge community is the perfect hype machine for promoting a new movie, a product release, or a lagging political campaign" but "very specific set of etiquette. Redditors don't want to advertise for you, they want to talk to you."[152] Journalists have used the site as a basis for stories, though they are advised by the site's policies to respect that "reddit's communities belong to their members" and to seek proper attribution for people's contributions.[153]
