Besides Ben Stiller, actors Owen Wilson and Jon Stewart were considered potential candidates for the role of Ted Stroehmann.[5] Bill Murray was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for it.[6][7] Brett Favre plays himself in a cameo that was originally written-for and offered to NFL quarterback Steve Young, but he turned the role down due to the film's coarse nature and was replaced with Favre.[8]
