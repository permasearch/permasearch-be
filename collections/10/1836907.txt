In the game, players attempt to prevent balloons (called bloons in-game) from reaching the end of a set course by placing towers or road items along it that can pop the bloons in a variety of ways. Some towers can stall the bloons and give the other towers more time to pop them by freezing and gluing the bloons. Money is gained by popping bloons and completing levels, and can be spent on new towers, upgrades for existing ones, or temporary items such as exploding pineapples and road spikes.
