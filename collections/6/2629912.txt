While usually caused by Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, which is a member of the herpes virus family,[3] a few other viruses may also cause the disease.[3] It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood.[2] Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes.[2] Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop.[2] Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies.[3] Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are atypical.[3][7] The monospot test is not recommended for general use due to poor accuracy.[8]
