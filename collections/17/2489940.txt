Hawkeye enjoys many adventures with the Avengers and proves himself a hero on numerous occasions. However, when his bow breaks during a crucial moment in a battle, Clint decides to adopt a new costume and identity by succeeding Hank Pym as the new Goliath.[20] Hawkeye (as Goliath) was later approached by his brother Barney, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle.[21] (It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.)[22] Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Hank Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the Kree-Skrull War Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume. After several adventures, Hawkeye quits the Avengers after a bitter rift with the Vision over the affections of the Scarlet Witch. Hawkeye returns to his original costume and strikes out on his own.[23]
