Banjaras were traditionally suppliers of bullock and salt merchants. They also traded in grain and were known for long-distance commodity transport before the advent of the railways. During British rule Banjaras were forced to give up their traditional occupations. This led to some of them settling down as farmers near mountains and hilly regions, while others were driven into forests. The Banjaras of Maharashtra, called Vanjaris, are engaged in farm sector and large number of them are highly educated.[4][5]
