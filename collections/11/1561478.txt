According to the Naval History and Heritage Command, the Master-at-arms rating was officially established in 1797, disestablished in 1921,[9] only to be re-established by the Chief of Naval Personnel on August 1, 1973 in BUPERSNOTE 1440 Change 1, thereby making that date "August 1st" as the official birthday of the modern U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms.[10] This formal creation of the master-at-arms rating was unfortunately the result of a recommendation made by the Special Subcommittee of Congress on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy, because of riots that occurred on the USS Kitty Hawk and the USS Constellation in 1972 because of racial tensions. According to the archived reports, the findings of the committee concluded that there was no formal training for the master-at-arms force on the ships, the U.S. Marine Detachment was not effectively utilized by the chief master-at-arms of the ships, and that a separate rating be established to perform law enforcement duties similar to the other military services.[11]
