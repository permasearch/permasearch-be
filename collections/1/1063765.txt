Unlike almost every other county in Kansas, owing to its highly urbanised nature and significant black population, Wyandotte County has been solidly Democratic ever since the New Deal. The only Democrat to lose Wyandotte County since 1932 has been George McGovern in Richard Nixonâ€™s 3,000-plus-county landslide of 1972, when Nixon swept all 275 counties in Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. Wyandotte was the only county in Kansas to vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944,[b] Adlai Stevenson II in both 1952 and 1956, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Walter Mondale in 1984.
