This legend, which surfaced on the Internet just in time for Halloween in October 2004, claimed that drug dealers were giving lollipops laced with drugs, typically a combination of THC and PCP, to unsuspecting children and causing them great harm.  Such suckers are allegedly referred to as "dro pops" or something to that effect, and various towns around the country have had their own versions of the legend.[118]  According to the U.S. DEA, suckers containing THC and/or PCP have been found and confiscated in Chicago in the spring of 2004.   They also report that in 2003 and 2004 some psilocybin mushroom chocolate candies were seized near Amarillo, Texas,[119] and that hollowed-out lollipops filled with heroin have been seized in New York City.[120] The goal of doing so was likely to evade detection by law enforcement by disguising the drugs as candy. There is no evidence that these were ever given to children, much less that any such children were harmed, or even that such lollipops have been found outside of these specific locations or anywhere since early 2004.[118] Thus, this legend can be considered to be in a similar vein as the infamous blue star tattoo legend.
