Premillennialism was a focus of controversy during the first half of the 20th century.[21]:219 One of the most influential advocates for that point of view was Robert Henry Boll,[73]:96â€“97[74]:306 whose eschatological views came to be most singularly opposed by Foy E. Wallace Jr.[75] By the end of the 20th century, however, the divisions caused by the debate over premillennialism were diminishing, and in the 2000 edition of the directory Churches of Christ in the United States, published by Mac Lynn, congregations holding premillennial views were no longer listed separately.[73]:97[76]
