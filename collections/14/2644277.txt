The Joint Session also had a negative impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions.[45] In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison.[45] The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel.[45] The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come.[45] Pseudo-science took control.[45]
