Baptism in Churches of Christ is performed only by full bodily immersion,[164]:p.107[165]:p.124 based on the Koine Greek verb baptizo which means to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge.[166][167]:p.139[168]:p.313–314[169]:p.22[170]:p.45–46 Submersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism.[166][167]:p.140[168]:p.314–316 Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the 1st century, and that pouring and sprinkling later emerged as secondary modes when immersion was not possible.[167]:p.140 Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion.[167]:p.140 Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (i.e., infant baptism is not practiced because the New Testament has no precedent for it).[165]:p.124[166][168]:p.318–319[171]:p.195
