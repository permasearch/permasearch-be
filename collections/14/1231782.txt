First aired September 18, 2014 It's Week 2 at the ranch and this week is all about knocking out the competition, excuses and the core emotional issues that have led the contestants to this point. Jessie, Jen and Dolvett aren't just reshaping their teams' bodies; they're reshaping the way the contestants see themselves and deal with their personal issues. Jessie starts off by focusing on proper nutrition, which is a vital component to weight loss. He teaches the Blue Team how to make a Waldorf salad, and over their healthy meal, bonds with the contestants by opening up about missing his wife and young son back in Toronto.
