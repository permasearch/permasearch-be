Administrative positions do not exactly tally with ranks among Inspector level and junior officers, admin positions (from PC to Station Commander or even Deputy Chief of a sub-Bureau), are various and flexible, it depends on each individual's qualifications and multiple skills, performance efficiency and effectiveness, years of service, personality and communication ability, potential leadership. Loyal and qualified officers with no misconduct record, are eligible to get rank promotion every four years (only applicable from Sgt 1st class to Insp 1st class). For example, a normal PC holding a non-commissioned position during his/her entire police career, with the increasing years of service, the highest rank he/she may attain is either Insp 3rd class (for high school and below qualification holders), or Insp 1st class (for university graduated certificate holders). Alternatively, young officers who are holding university degree(regardless of disciplines and majors), usually after three years of service, once his/her overall performance and ability meet operation needs, recommended by his/her team leader or a higher commanding officer, may have chance to get promoted (as sub-unit commander, detective supervisor...).
