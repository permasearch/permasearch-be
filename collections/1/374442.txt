In North America, hail is most common in the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming meet, known as "Hail Alley."[58] Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September. Cheyenne, Wyoming is North America's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season.[59] In South America, areas prone to hail are cities like BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
