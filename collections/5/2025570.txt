Although Farmiga initially planned to become an accountant,[10] she was persuaded to appear in her sister Vera Farmiga's directorial debut drama Higher Ground, playing the 16-year-old version of the lead character Corinne Walker.[11] Shortly after its premiere at the 2011 Sundance, and following rave reviews for her performance,[12] she was signed to talent agency ICM Partners.[13] That same year, Farmiga starred in the first season of FX's anthology series American Horror Story, launching her to worldwide prominence.[14] She portrayed Violet Harmon in American Horror Story: Murder House, the troubled adolescent daughter of Vivien (Connie Britton) and Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott)[15][16] – a role she secured in her first professional acting audition.[17] Farmiga then joined the cast of Sofia Coppola's crime satire The Bling Ring, based on the real life group of the same name, portraying 17-year-old wild child Sam Moore.[18] The film opened in Un Certain Regard at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, to generally positive reviews.[19]
