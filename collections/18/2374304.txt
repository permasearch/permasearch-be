Voting franchise was according to each state's specific electoral laws. South Australian and Western Australian women were enfranchised, but in the other states they could not vote. Tasmania retained a small property qualification for voting, but in the other states all males over 21 were eligible to vote. Only in South Australia and Tasmania, however, were indigenous Australians even theoretically entitled to vote. A few may have done so in South Australia.
