The game has often had championship implications, with both teams competitive in the Southeastern Conference. Florida, which did not win the SEC title until 1991, had its hopes dashed several times by a loss to Georgia in Jacksonville.[9] The game took on new importance when the SEC split into Eastern and Western Divisions in 1992, with both Florida and Georgia in the Eastern Division. As the two teams have frequently led the division, the game has often effectively determined who will represent the Eastern Division in the SEC Championship Game.[9][10] To date, Florida has twelve Eastern Division titles while Georgia has five.
