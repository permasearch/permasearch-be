The film series "was intended as a Christian version of Sir Kenneth Clark's popular Civilization series on public television."[18] Schaeffer often decried the Civilization series and other programs appearing on Public Television in America as part of a relativist conspiracy, declaring, "Public television gives us many things that many of us like culturally, but is also completely committed to a propaganda position that the last reality is only material/energy shaped by pure chance. Clark's Civilization, Bronowski's The Ascent of Man, Carl Sagan's Cosmos â€“ they all say it. There is only one final view of reality that's possible and that is that the final reality is material or energy shaped by pure chance. It is about us on every side, and especially the government and the courts have become the vehicle to force this anti-God view on the total population."[19] A number of consultants and researchers were approached to provide input in specialist areas, including Hans Rookmaaker for the history of art, and opera singer Jane Stuart Smith for music.[20] A guide to accompany the film series was also produced to facilitate group study.
