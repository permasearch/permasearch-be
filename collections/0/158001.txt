Mary McManamon (see above) writing in the Catholic University Law Review[84] believes that Cruz is not eligible because he was not born in the United States.[169] Professor Einer Elhauge of Harvard,[170] Professor Robert Clinton of Arizona State University,[171] University of Chicago Professor Eric Posner,[172] former Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler,[89] and Professor Victor Williams of Catholic University of America's law school[173] agree that Cruz is not eligible. Alan Grayson, a Democratic Member of Congress from Florida, does not believe Cruz is a natural-born citizen, and stated he would have filed a lawsuit if Cruz had become the Republican nominee.[174] Orly Taitz, Larry Klayman, and Mario Apuzzo, who each filed multiple lawsuits challenging Obama's eligibility, have also asserted that Cruz is not eligible.[175][176]
