Like every other state in the United States, driving under the influence is a crime in Kansas, and is subject to a great number of regulations outside of the Liquor Control Act.[4] Kansas's maximum blood alcohol level for driving is .08% for persons over the age of 21 and .02% for adults under the age of 21 and minors.[4]
