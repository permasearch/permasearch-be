While serving as First Sea Lord, his primary concerns dealt with devising plans on how the Royal Navy would keep shipping lanes open if Britain fell victim to a nuclear attack. Today, this seems of minor importance but at the time few people comprehended the potentially limitless destruction nuclear weapons possess and the ongoing dangers posed by the fallout. Military commanders did not understand the physics involved in a nuclear explosion. This became evident when Mountbatten had to be reassured that the fission reactions from the Bikini Atoll tests would not spread through the oceans and blow up the planet.[77] As Mountbatten became more familiar with this new form of weaponry, he increasingly grew opposed to its use in combat yet at the same time he realised the potential nuclear energy had, especially with regards to submarines. Mountbatten expressed his feelings towards the use of nuclear weapons in combat in his article "A Military Commander Surveys The Nuclear Arms Race", which was published shortly after his death in International Security in the Winter of 1979â€“1980.[78] After leaving the Admiralty, Lord Mountbatten took the position of Chief of the Defence Staff.[62] He served in this post for six years during which he was able to consolidate the three service departments of the military branch into a single Ministry of Defence.[79] Mountbatten was appointed Colonel of the Life Guards, Gold Stick in Waiting, and Life Colonel Commandant of the Royal Marines in 1965.[74] He was Governor of the Isle of Wight from 20 July 1965[80] and then the first Lord Lieutenant of the Isle of Wight from 1 April 1974.[81]
