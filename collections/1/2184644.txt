The Mongol invasions of Korea (1231â€“1259) comprised a series of campaigns between 1231 and 1270 by the Mongol Empire against the Kingdom of Goryeo (the proto-state of modern-day Korea). There were seven major campaigns at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean Peninsula, ultimately resulting in Korea becoming a vassal state[1] of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty for approximately 80 years.
