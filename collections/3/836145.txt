Thereupon, Shiva himself came to the court and challenged Nakkeerar. But Nakkeerar was not moved. Though Shiva asked him if the hair of Ganapoongodai, the consort of Kalathinathar, whom Nakkeerar worshipped,did not have a natural scent, Nakkeerar asserted that it was so. Shiva told that because of Nakkeerar's foolishness he had done so (Since Parvathy is the other part of the supreme god who dwells in everything including flowers, so it is understood that she can possess fragrance as well as other attributes of the universe) and opened the eye in his forehead (Netrikkan) which emitted fire and looked at Nakkeerar to show the poet who he was. Even then, Nakkeerar persisted in his statement. As he could not bear the scorching heat emanating from the divine eye he jumped into the water of the Golden Lotus Tank. Then at the request of the other poets, the Lord took Nakkeerar out of the tank, forgave him and made him study under 'Agasthiar', the Tamil Sage. Shiva said that there were mistakes in Nakkeerar's poetry. He asked Nakkeerar to correct his Tamil grammatical mistakes and misplaced words before writing poems again.
