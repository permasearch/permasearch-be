Medical testing can confirm the presence of West Nile fever or a West Nile-related illness, such as meningitis or encephalitis.[36] If infected, a blood test may show a rising level of antibodies to the West Nile virus. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common way to diagnose meningitis, by analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord.[37] The fluid sample may show an elevated white cell count and antibodies to the West Nile virus if you were exposed.[37] In some cases, an electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can help detect brain inflammation.[37]
