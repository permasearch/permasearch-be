This message was not received in time, with Lount replying that the rebels had already been ordered to march to Toronto and were on their way.[28] Barely armed with pikes and guns for hunting fowl, the farmers from York County marched from Newmarket down Yonge Street towards Toronto and Montgomery's Tavern.
