Critical reactions to Blurred Lines were mostly positive. The Michigan Daily's Jackson Howard graded it an "A" and praised it as "one of Pharrell's best beats in years ... by the time the multilayered and carnal harmonies of the chorus come in, the song is completely on fire."[25] Writing for Billboard, Chris Payne compared it with Justin Timberlake's "Suit & Tie" and called it a "bubbly bit of disco-shuffling R&B", while also noting its racy content.[26] Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, who gave the song three out of five stars, was more wary of the single and remarked: "It's a subject that when in the right hands can be smooth and soulful, but in the wrong, crass and chauvinistic ... you need the right balance of charm and swagger to pull it off."[27] The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked "Blurred Lines" at number four to find the best music of 2013, tied with Kanye West's "New Slaves".
