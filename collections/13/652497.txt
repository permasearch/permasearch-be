After completing their service with JVC, many former Jesuit volunteers (FJVs) create a subculture of faith and service in the church.[3] As of 2006, there were twelve thousand former Jesuit Volunteers worldwide.[3] In Washington, D.C., former JVs, progressive adult Catholics, and others meet for faith-sharing groups and potluck dinners. This community is called "Guerilla Communion".[18] Former Jesuit Volunteers or FJVs use the phrase "ruined for life" to describe their time of service with JVC.[19] The term "ruined for life" was coined by JVC's founder Jack Morris]].[4] Some FJVs have entered religious life.[4]
