An alternate version, "The Crispy Chicken Song", was featured in Blige's ad for Burger King over which the she sings the praises of the Crispy Chicken Snack Wrap.[2] The commercial drew a backlash from fans, who complained that the content was playing into African-American stereotypes, and the fast-food chain quickly pulled the commercial, citing music licensing issues.[3] Blige responded by claiming the final version that was shown on TV was not what she signed up for, stating that she "would never just bust out singing about chicken and chicken wings," adding: "It hurt my feelings and crushed me for two days."[3] The fast food restaurant chain soon after issued a public apologize to Blige and later pulled the ad.[3]
