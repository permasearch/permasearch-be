On 15 May 1947, the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations resolved that the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine be created "to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine."[142] In the Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947 to the General Assembly,[143] the majority of the Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under an International Trusteeship System."[144] On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 (II) recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union.[24] The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency, which was the recognized representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan.[26][27] The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it, and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.[25][145] On the following day, 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and Arab gangs began attacking Jewish targets.[146] The Jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out, but in early April 1948 moved onto the offensive.[147][148] The Arab Palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled.[149]
