Outdoor barbecues (usually known simply as BBQ) are popular among local residents on short trips to regional parks in the countryside.[12] These are invariably charcoal-fired, with marinated pieces of meat, usually beef, pork, sausage, or chicken wings, cooked using long, hand-held forks. Honey is brushed on near the end of cooking. At the same time, foil-wrapped pieces of corn and sweet potato are placed on the hot coals; these take a long time to cook so they are usually eaten at the end of the barbecue. Unlike Western barbecues, everyone gathers around the fire and cooks their own food, so the atmosphere is closer to that of a fondue or a hot pot.
