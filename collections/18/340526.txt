Many more years later, an adult Henry has found himself in trouble with Lady Tremaine in a new realm. Right before he's about to get captured, he uses the magic bottle to call on Hook, Emma, and Regina for help. Hook and Regina drop in through a portal and are able to free him. A little while later, Hook offers to go to the port to see if people have heard anything about Cinderella. There, he comes across the Hook from the Wish Realm, who had also been called over due to Henry's bottle message. The wish Hook explains that ever since meeting Emma in the Wish Realm years back, he had been traveling the realms in hopes of reuniting with her. He knocks out the original Hook in hopes of taking his place and getting a ride back to Storybrooke to be with Emma. The wish Hook finds Lady Tremaine, who physically transforms him into his younger form in exchange for helping getting rid of Henry.
