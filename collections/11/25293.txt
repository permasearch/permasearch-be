Elements of the game were criticized. Sullivan found some side missions repetitive, and Sliwinski was disappointed with some of the boss battles.[18][80] Miller wrote that some Shadow of Mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy.[75] Critics disagreed about the Nemesis system. Miller wrote that the system fell flat in the game's final hours;[75] according to VanOrd, the system was unappealing until the game's second half.[76] Carter found the unskippable cutscenes after a player died annoying.[73]
