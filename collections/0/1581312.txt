Gaff is a Los Angeles police officer who escorts Deckard throughout his mission. He primarily uses "Cityspeak", a creole of Spanish, French, German, Hungarian, Chinese, and Japanese, which Deckard pretends not to understand.[1] Gaff is never shown participating in Deckard's investigation, preferring to linger in the background crafting origami figures.
