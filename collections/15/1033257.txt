District 12's geography is dominated by forests and meadows. The meadow, which is located just outside the community, ends at a long electric fence constructed to keep the wild animals from escaping the forest outside. It has many holes and, as mentioned above, is usually turned off, giving Katniss and Gale chance to hunt; however, the fence is fully electrified after Romulus Thread replaces Cray as Head Peacekeeper. The forest has a lake, is vast, and contains a large amount of wildlife enough to support more than 800 residents of the district stranded after the bombings in Catching Fire. Many do not know where it leads to; as revealed in Catching Fire, the forest eventually ends at District 13, located a week away from District 12 on foot. Another feature of the district is a small hill, which is where the Victor's Village is located. It contains twelve big villas facing each other in two rows. It is very quiet for most of its history since District 12 has few Victors, though more people begin to settle there after the war. After the Capitol bombs District 12 at the end of Catching Fire, most of the residency is destroyed with its meadow turned into a mass grave of the residents unable to escape and with only the Victor's Village left unharmed. After the Second Rebellion, though, the District 12 refugees begin to return to their home, including Katniss, who states in the epilogue that the mass grave is returning into the meadow again.
