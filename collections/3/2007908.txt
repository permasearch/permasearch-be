According to Robert Englund, there is a homo-erotic subtext to the film implying that Jesse is homosexual and Freddy is his fear of accepting that fact. In this subtext, Ron is intended to be the object of Jesse's affections, implied when he leaves his girlfriend Lisa after a failed attempt at sex and retreats to Ron's bedroom.[13]
