By January 1980 the left-wing political organizations united to form the Coordinated Revolutionaries of the Masses (CRM). A few months later the left-wing armed groups united to form the Unified Revolutionary Directorate (DRU). It was renamed the FMLN[2] following its merger with the Communist Party in October 1980.
