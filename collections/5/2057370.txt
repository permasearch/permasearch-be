One day, Sivaji and his son set fire to Muthupandi’s home with plans of killing Santhosh. But Santhosh gets alerted and he escapes. Also he saves Kavitha’s horse doll which she considers to be precious (as it was made by Muthupandi when they were young). On the day before the counting, Mayan takes a few bundles from Santhosh and places it along with Muthupandi’s so that Santhosh will lose the challenge.
