Outgoing transport (anterograde) carries mitochondria and membrane proteins needed for growth to the axon terminal. Ingoing transport (retrograde) carries cell waste materials from the axon terminal to the soma.[8] Outgoing and ingoing tracks use different sets of motor proteins.[7] Outgoing transport is provided by kinesin, and ingoing return traffic is provided by dynein. Dinein is minus-end directed.[8] There are many forms of kinesis and dynein motor proteins, and each is thought to carry a different cargo.[7] The studies on transport in the axon led to the naming of kinesin.
