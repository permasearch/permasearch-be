As part of an extensive advertising campaign, Reynolds discussed taking part in the production of a nude scene. The scene was filmed in a period of three days, and took approximately twelve takes to complete.[14] Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that "when everyone else acts like it's just a normal day it really helps you relax." Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, "You could literally see everything."[15] Similar sentiments were expressed by Reynolds, who in an interview with People, stated, "Filming a scene that involves being entirely naked and takes a couple days can be a little awkward." He continued: "Thankfully you're there for so long and you're doing it for so long that you dispense with the awkwardness pretty quickly and start to have mundane, normal conversations â€“ the difference being you're not wearing pants."[16]
