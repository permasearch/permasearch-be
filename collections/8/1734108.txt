Mark Diesendorf and B.K. Sovacool review the "little-known research which shows that the life-cycle CO2 emissions of nuclear power may become comparable with those of fossil power as the 5.4 million tonnes of high-grade uranium ore is used up over the next several decades and low-grade uranium is mined and milled using fossil fuels".[97][98] Critics calculate that if nuclear energy were used to rapidly replace existing energy sources, there would be an energy cannibalism effect, which would affect the carbon neutral growth rate of the technology.[99]
