Following the World Cup debacle, both Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard retired from international football and Wayne Rooney was promptly installed as the new captain. England's first match following the tournament, a 1â€“0 friendly win over Norway, was more noticeable for being the lowest attended international match in Wembley history. The FA made the unprecedented decision to close off the top block of the stadium due to a lack of interest from fans; the match was also beaten head-to-head in the TV ratings by an episode of the popular BBC programme, The Great British Bake Off.
