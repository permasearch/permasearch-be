For 1806, a population of 24,241,000 for several Imperial Circles is quoted in the "Statistik des deutschen Reiches",[2] even though the old Holy Roman Empire had fallen apart, and a new German Empire did not exist yet as a political entity. By 1821, the population within the newly founded German Confederation had grown to over 30 million.[3]
