She's kidnapped by Quinn after he realizes that she has the Intersect and forces her to flash on Intersect images, wiping her memories, including those of her relationship with Chuck. He then manipulates Sarah into believing that he's her CIA handler and that she has orders to bring him the Intersect glasses and kill Chuck. Sarah is able to get the glasses, but Chuck had managed to switch them. Sarah then takes Ellie hostage as leverage against Chuck and Chuck agrees to give her to the glasses and Sarah threatens to kill Ellie if she senses that it's a trap. As they drive to where Chuck hid the glasses, Ellie notices that Sarah isn't wearing her seatbelt and tells her that if she had her memories back, she would want her to do whatever needed to protect Chuck and then crashes her car, which knocks Sarah out. Chuck then tells Ellie that he knows where to take Sarah to help her get her memories back. Sarah awakens in the house she and Chuck had planned to buy and Chuck tells her that he brought her there hoping that she'd remember the house, if not him. Sarah tells him that their relationship was nothing more than a cover and he was just an assignment. Chuck tells her that he was an assignment, but then that she fell in love with him. With tears in his eyes, he tells her about their first real, non-cover kiss was when they thought they were going to die from a bomb and how he closed his eyes and felt her grab him and then kiss him and how they tried to pretend it never happened and how one day he was so sure that she could never love a nerd like him, she came over and he asked if she loved him and that she said yes. Chuck then tells her that when he proposed, they knew they would be together for the rest of their lives, living in this house and raising a family.
