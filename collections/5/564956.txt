If the clause is clear and unambiguous in its meaning, the courts give it that meaning. In Durban's Water Wonderland v Botha,[76] where the respondent and her child sustained injuries when they were thrown off a malfunctioning jet ride at an amusement park, the court found that the exemption clause clearly covered any liability based on negligence related to the ride's design or manufacture. This approach has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal in more recent cases.[77][78]
