In the late nineteenth century, technology innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs, and made monuments more affordable for small towns. Companies looking to capitalize off of this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the North and South.[16] Another wave of monument construction coincided with the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954â€“1968) and the American Civil War Centennial.[17] Thirty-two Confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, but not all were new monuments, several were re-dedications to mark the 100-year anniversary of their construction.[6]
