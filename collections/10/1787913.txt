Ballard's release from Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she received a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings.[49] She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, and was forced to formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement.[50] Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved.[51] In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7Â million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group;[52] the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 32.[53] At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.
