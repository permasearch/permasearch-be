Typical modern multimode graded-index fibers have 3 dB/km of attenuation loss (50% loss per km) at 850 nm and 1 dB/km at 1300 nm. Singlemode 9/125 loses 0.4 dB/km at 1310 nm and 0.25 dB/km at 1550 nm. Very high quality singlemode fiber intended for long distance applications is specified at a loss of 0.19 dB/km at 1550 nm.[21] POF (plastic optical fiber) loses much more: 1 dB/m at 650 nm. Plastic optical fiber is large core (about 1mm) fiber suitable only for short, low speed networks such as within cars.[22]
