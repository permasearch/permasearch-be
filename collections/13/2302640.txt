In the Brahm Avtar composition present in Dasam Granth, Second Scripture of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned Rishi Kashyapa as the second avatar of Brahma.[41] According to him, Rishi Kashyapa had great knowledge of the Vedas and gave it a satisfactory universal interpretation.[42] He married four wives, Banita, Kadru, Diti and Aditi and had many children. Some of them remained religious (Deities) and others became irreligious (Demons).[43]
