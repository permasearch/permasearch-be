Musically, "Some Nights" is an indie pop song with strong, festive elements of Power pop and influences from folk rock.[citation needed] It is written in the key of C major at a tempo of 108 beats per minute. A line in their lyrics, "this is it boys, this is war", recalls the English version of Nena's 1983 hit "99 Luftballons". Lyrically, the song expresses the existential angst of a young protagonist who is a long way from home.[1] Lead singer Nate Ruess explained to Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press: "I'm always thinking about, 'Who am I and why did I do something like that?' And I think then it harkens back to my family, and I have such a strong tie to them and it's always therapeutic to sing about them."[2] Ruess came up with the song and album title while on tour in Scotland; he wrote the song based on the title. Lyrically, the song is about "just being someone different on any given night."[3]
