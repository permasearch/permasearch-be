Practicing without a license (American English) or practising without a licence (British, Irish, and Commonwealth English) is the act of working without the licensure offered for that occupation, in a particular jurisdiction.[1] Most activities that require licensure also have penalties for practicing without a valid, current license.[2] In some jurisdictions, a license is offered but not required for some professions.[3]
