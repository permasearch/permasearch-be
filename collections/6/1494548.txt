Time helped cement the two women's friendship. Sally called Stephanie "Highness" or "Queenie"; at first the nicknames were meant to be sarcastic, but became terms of affection. (Stephanie called her "doll" and she also referred to her as "Sal, my gal") She was considered to be part of the extended Forrester family, often joining Stephanie at family functions (this was by virtue of Sally's daughter Macy, and later, her surrogate daughter, Darla, being married to Thorne Forrester). Even after Forrester was unwillingly sold to Nick Marone (Jack Wagner), Sally was still considered family, and beloved by everyone. In fact, Eric considered her a Forrester herself. She also gave nicknames to others in her extended family, namely Felicia Forrester (Lesli Kay), whom she affectionately called "Fifi." In addition, Sally defended Stephanie against Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown), who was harassing the Forrester matriarch after poisoning her with mercury pills, this planted the seeds of Stephanie and Sally's friendship.
