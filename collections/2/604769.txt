Former captain Shaun Udal also announced his retirement, having played for Hampshire since 1989,[32] though he later joined Middlesex. Dimitri Mascarenhas was named Warne's replacement as captain for the 2008 season.[33] In 2008, Hampshire struggled and were near the foot of the Division 1 table for the majority of the season. Midway through the season coach Paul Terry stood down and was replaced by Giles White.  A series of strong performances helped Hampshire go from relegation favourites to title outsiders going into the final round of matches. The club ended up finishing in third place, twelve points behind winners Durham.[34]  On 25 July the club won the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final at Lord's, beating rivals Sussex[35] thanks to a man-of-the-match performance from Dominic Cork, with him taking 4/41.  Hampshire created history by winning the 2010 Friends Provident t20 in front of home support after defeating Somerset – the first team to win a Twenty20 trophy on home turf in England and Wales. On 14 September 2011, in their four-day game against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, Hampshire were officially relegated to the County Championship Second Division. The 2012 season though, under new captain Jimmy Adams after the retirement of Cork, would prove to be highly successful for Hampshire with the county winning both the 2012 Friends Life t20[36] – their 2nd Twenty20 title, and the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40 where a final ball dot ball from Kabir Ali led to Hampshire winning as a result of losing less wickets than opponents Warwickshire.[37] Club legend Dimitri Mascarenhas played in both finals but retired at the end of the 2013 season.
