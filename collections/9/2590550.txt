Upper memory blocks can be created by mapping extended memory into the upper memory area when running in virtual x86 mode. This is similar to how expanded memory can be emulated using extended memory so this method of providing upper memory blocks is usually provided by the expanded memory manager (for example EMM386). Ironically the application programming interface for managing the upper memory blocks is specified in the eXtended Memory Specification.
