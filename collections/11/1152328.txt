Van der Waals' early, primary interests were in the field of thermodynamics, where a first influence was the published work by Rudolf Clausius on heat, in 1857; other significant influences were the writings by James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Willard Gibbs.[7] After initial pursuit of teaching credentials, Clausius' undergraduate coursework in mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands led, with significant hurdles, to his acceptance for doctoral studies at Leiden under Pieter Rijke. His dissertation was guided by a desire to explain the late-career experimental observation, in 1869 by Irish professor of chemistry Thomas Andrews (Queen's University Belfast), of the existence of critical temperatures in fluids.[8][non-primary source needed] van der Waals doctoral research culminated in an 1873 dissertation that provided a semi-quantitative theory describing the gas-liquid change of state and the origin of a critical temperature, Over de ContinuÃ¯teit van den Gas-en Vloeistof[-]toestand (Dutch; in English, On the Continuity of the Gas- and Liquid-State); it was in this dissertation that the first derivations of what we now refer to as the van der Waals equation appeared.[9] James Clerk Maxwell reviewed and lauded its published content in the British science journal Nature,[10][11] and van der Waals began independent work that would result in his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1910, which emphasized the contribution of his formulation of this "equation of state for gases and liquids."[7]
