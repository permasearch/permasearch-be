There are significant potential drawbacks that may be associated with IPAs as well. Joining an IPA will not relieve a physician from all of the administrative duties of running a medical practice. Also, some IPAs may not be run effectively; this can be due to rapid growth, lack of a sufficiently experience management team, or rapidly changing technology in the field. It is also possible for IPAs to face antitrust issues because they may represent competing healthcare providers.[1]
