The lowest reliably measured temperature on Earth of −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) was in Vostok on 21 July 1983 at 05:45 Moscow Time,[18][19] which was 07:45 for Vostok's time zone, and 01:45 UTC (See List of weather records).  This beat the station's former record of −88.3 °C (−126.9 °F) on 24 August 1960.[17] Lower temperatures occurred higher up towards the summit of the ice sheet as temperature decreases with height along the surface.
