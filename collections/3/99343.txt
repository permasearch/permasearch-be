The expanded roster includes all players who are eligible for call-up to the active roster at any given time. Also on the 40-man are any players on the 10-day disabled list and minor league players who are signed to a major-league contract but are on an "optional assignment" to the minors. (Each player has three "option years" to be sent to the minors once on the expanded roster before they must be placed on waivers to be sent there.) Players who were on the 40-man but are placed on the 60-day disabled list are taken off the 40-man until the time on the DL is over. The same applies to players who are suspended. Because players on the 60-day DL are taken off the 40-man with no risk of losing the player, MLB teams often transfer injured players from the 10-day DL to the 60-day DL so that they can add another player to the 40-man without having to designate a player for assignment. Designating for assignment ("DFA") is the removal of a player from the expanded roster, whereby the team has 10 days to trade the player, release him, or send him to the minors.
