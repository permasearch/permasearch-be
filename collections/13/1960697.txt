In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles.[270] Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan;[270] and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered "0000001".[271] The auction raised over $9 million,[272] a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.[273]
