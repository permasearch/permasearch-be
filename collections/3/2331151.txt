During October 2003, government owned SBS TV began airing a Vietnamese news program called Thoi Su ('News'). The stated purpose was to provide a news service to cater for Australia's Vietnamese population. This was received poorly by the significant portion of the Vietnamese community as many had previously fled after the fall of South Vietnam and thus harbour resentment to the communist government and its institutions, including the state-controlled media.  Thoi Su was regarded as a mouthpiece for the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party, and uncritically endorsed government policy and practices using strong language while failing to report issues objectively including political arrests or religious oppression in Vietnam.  A large protest was convened outside SBS's offices.[8] SBS decided to drop Thoi Su (which was being provided at no cost to SBS through a satellite connection).  SBS subsequently began broadcasting disclaimers before each foreign news program stating it does not endorse their contents.
