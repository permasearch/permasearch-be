In the 1960s and early 1970s, hemispherectomy involved essentially removing an entire half of the brain. This procedure is known as anatomical hemispherectomy. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. A second type of hemispherectomy, known as functional hemispherectomy, has become more prevalent in recent years. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. If a functional hemispherectomy is chosen over an anatomical hemispherectomy, it is likely because it allows for less blood loss and greater chance of resilience for the patient.[6][7] Additionally, functional hemispherectomy is less likely to cause hydrocephalus, the “excessive accumulation of (cerebrospinal) fluid in the brain,” which leads to complications from harmful pressure on brain tissues.[8]
