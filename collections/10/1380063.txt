The chair of the group has the responsibility to determine if a quorum is present.[7] In addition, any member can raise a point of order about an apparent absence of a quorum.[8] Because it is difficult to determine exactly when a quorum was lost, points of order relating to the absence of a quorum are "generally not permitted to affect prior action; but upon clear and convincing proof, such a point of order can be given effect retrospectively by a ruling of the presiding officer, subject to appeal."[7]
