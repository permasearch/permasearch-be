The British version of the video is in black and white, directed by David Mould. It shows the band performing in a desert setting amidst trucks and filming equipment; the actual filming location is the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park in northern Los Angeles County, California. By the end of the video, it rains on the band, but they continue playing. This was actually the first version of the video produced, but the band expressed dissatisfaction with it, leading to the other video. Only the US version appears on the band's 1998 video compilation 7 Television Commercials, and both the UK and U.S. versions appear on the Radiohead: The Best Of DVD released in 2008 by EMI.
