In 1642, the Renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator (by Wilhelm Schickard[7] and several decades later Blaise Pascal[8]), a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention.[9] Pascal's Calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the "inventor" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.[10]) Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the stepped reckoner, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.[11] There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.[12]
