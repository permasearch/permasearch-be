On the review aggregator Metacritic, the film had an average score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics.[12] At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews.[13] The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez "holds the screen in a star performance that has less to do with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had "audience gasping" and "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears".[14] On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as "arduously nonsensical" and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child."[15] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" while it "uses the tiresome old "kid" clichÃ©. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story."[16] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt".[16] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." Additionally, LaSalle felt that "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.[17]
