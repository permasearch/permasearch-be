The audio of Escape from Butcher Bay was generally well received,[52][53] and critics praised its voice acting; the performances of Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser were given special commendation.[48][69][70] In regard to the music, FiringSquad's Jakub Wojnarowicz stated, "It's not good enough to sweep you away[,] but it's also not bad enough to stick out like a sore thumb".[68] IGN said, "The music isn't memorable, but it's not bad".[16] The Sunday Herald Sun called the voice acting "Surprisingly good".[71] The game's length was commonly criticized. Reviewers noted that it could be completed in eight to fifteen hours,[1][48][53] and IGN said, "If you consider around 12 hours of gameplay short, then Riddick is just that."[53] Several reviewers were displeased by the game's lack of multiplayer components;[9][51][53] Computer and Video Games referred to it as a "missed opportunity".[6] Game Informer said, "Since the main quest is short [...] and there is no multiplayer, itâ€™s not a ton of game for your money."[48]
