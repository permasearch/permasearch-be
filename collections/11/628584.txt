Religion is lightly touched upon in the series, if only as one of the pillars of traditional Americana. In a sprinkling of episodes, Beaver refers to having attended church earlier on a Sunday or referring to a lesson learned in Sunday School. Ward uses parables — some from the Bible — to impart wisdom to the boys after they've experienced a difficult situation. He also often paraphrased from Greek fables to educate Wally and The Beaver about morality issues.
