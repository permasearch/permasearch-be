Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[64] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[285] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "...Â Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."[1] During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[286] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[287] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[288]
