On 22 October 2012, HSV7 (7 Melbourne) moved The Price Is Right to 3pm, with Melbourne travel show Coxy's Big Break taking over its 5pm timeslot. This move was made in an attempt to boost 7 News Melbourne ratings, but was unsuccessful.[5] The move led to speculation that the show would be axed, as it wasn't mentioned in 7's 2013 programming launch, and Emdur made comments on The Morning Show about "needing a new job".
