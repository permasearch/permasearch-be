Spieth accepted an exemption to play in the PGA Tour's HP Byron Nelson Championship in 2010. It was the event's first amateur exemption since 1995.[13] The tournament's previous exemptions had included Trip Kuehne in 1995, Justin Leonard, and Woods in 1993.[13] He made the cut, becoming the sixth-youngest player to make the cut at a PGA Tour event.[14] Spieth was tied for seventh place after the third round, and finished the tournament in a tie for 16th place.[15] He was offered another exemption into the tournament in 2011, when he again made the cut and finished in a tie for 32nd.[16]
