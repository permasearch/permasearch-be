The manic "Travelin' Band" was inspired by 1950s rock 'n' roll songs, particularly those by Little Richard. In October 1972, the company that held the publishing rights to Richard's "Good Golly, Miss Molly" felt that "Travelin' Band" bore enough similarities to warrant a plagiarism lawsuit that was later settled out of court. The lyrics of the song describe what life is like for a musician on the road, something the band knew about all too well. The song's flip side, "Who'll Stop the Rain", could not have been more different, with Fogerty telling Uncut's Tom Pinnock in 2012, "'Travelin' Band' was my salute to Little Richard, but 'Who'll Stop The Rain?' was part of the fabric of the times. From '68 to '74, Vietnam was probably the most important thing on the minds of young people." The menacing "Run Through the Jungle" mined similar territory, with many listeners inevitably believing the lyrics to be about the war. According to the band's bassist Stu Cook, the song's opening and closing both featured jungle sound effects created by "lots of backwards recorded guitar and piano."[12] The harmonica part on the song was played by John Fogerty. The song was also rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty's favorite CCR song: "My all-time favorite Creedence tune was 'Run Through the Jungle'...It's like a little movie in itself with all the sound effects. It never changes key, but it holds your interest the whole time. It's like a musician's dream. It never changes key, yet you get the illusion it does."[13]
