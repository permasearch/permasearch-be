Symptoms may include fever, swelling, and complaint of excessive pain when compared to a small, benign swelling on the skin. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis and abscess, thus making the diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis at early stages difficult. Induration (hardening of the skin and soft tissue) and swelling beyond the area of skin changes are commonly present in those with early necrotizing changes.[2] The redness and swelling usually blends into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense.[6] Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotising changes (but present in later stages in 7% to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, skin ecchymosis which is present before skin necrosis[2] (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels),[6] presence of gas in tissues and reduced or absent sensation over the skin[2] (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves).[6] Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciiitis. When necrotising changes affects the groin it is known as Fournier gangrene.[2]
