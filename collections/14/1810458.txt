Because of this provision, any appreciation of the affected property that occurred during the decedent's lifetime will never be taxed. Thus, this provision provides an incentive for taxpayers to retain appreciated property until death, and sell property that has fallen in market value while alive (although it should be noted that property on which one may take depreciation may still cause a gain — even when sold for less its original purchase price — because depreciation subtracts from basis).
