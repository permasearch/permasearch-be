Ben first becomes Rath in "Con of Rath" (a play on Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) when the crown prince Tiffin sets off the Omnitrix's circuit, and caused it to keep Ben in that state for the whole episode until the Tiffin leaves, and when Ben found out that Kevin knew about it all the time, he turned back into him to beat Kevin up. Though being Rath alters his mind (to the point where he tries harming Captain Nemesis for cheating in a race), he is one of Ben's more powerful alien forms due to having enough physical agility and strength to easily lift objects far larger than him and pummel most enemies with ease. Both Kevin and Gwen find Rath the most amusing of Ben's aliens, often laughing behind his back or out of Ben's hearing range while he is transformed into Rath.
