Abbasid caliph Al-Mahdi extended the mosque to the north by 50 metres (160Â ft). His name was also inscribed on the walls of the mosque. He also planned to remove six steps to the minbar, but abandoned this idea, owing to this causing damage of the woods on which they were built.[22] According to an inscription of Ibn Qutaybah, the third caliph Al-Mamun did "unspecified work" on the mosque. Al-Mutawakkil lined the enclosure of Muhammad's tomb with marble.[23] Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri built a dome of stone over his grave in 1476.[24]
