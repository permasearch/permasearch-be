Proclamation of emergency per Article 352 (6) shall be ratified by the Parliament similar to its constituent power. When President's rule is invoked in a state using Article 356 (c) and its proclamation contains such incidental and consequential provisions suspending in whole or in part the operation of any provisions of the constitution relating to any body or authority in the State for giving effect to the objects of the proclamation, the proclamation needs to be approved by the Parliament under its constituent power (i.e. not by simple majority) after the 24th amendment[1][2]
