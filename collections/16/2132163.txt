Integral colour anodising is generally done with organic acids, but the same effect has been produced in laboratory with very dilute sulfuric acid. Integral color anodising was originally performed with oxalic acid, but sulfonated aromatic compounds containing oxygen, particularly sulfosalicylic acid, have been more common since the 1960s.[2] Thicknesses up to 50 Î¼m can be achieved. Organic acid anodising is called Type IC by MIL-A-8625.
