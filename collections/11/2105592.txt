Critical reception to the character and her portrayal has also been strongly positive. Jill Guccini of After Ellen described the climax of the first series as a "dramatic, absolutely stunningly acted and fabulously written crescendo" and ranked Caroline as one of her "favorite lesbian characters ever".[32] Reviewing the second episode of the third series, Neela Debnath of The Independent felt that Lancashire delivered the best performance in the series, in turn becoming the "real matriarch of the show".[33] Alison Graham of the Radio Times praised the episode following Kate's death, stating that some of the scenes between Celia and Caroline "will take away pieces of your heart".[34] Discussing the same episode, a reviewer for What's on TV stated that Lancashire gave "another masterclass in acting with a sublime, yet understated, performance throughout".[35] However, Wainwright's narrative decision to make Caroline a widow drew criticism from some quarters; Kaite Welsh writing in The Guardian felt the writer had decided to "[privilege] a toxic biological relationship over a happy queer marriage".[36]
