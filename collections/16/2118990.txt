It was long thought that the four songs that make up side 2 of Bringing It All Back Home were recorded in one long take.[4] This is not true, but "Gates of Eden" was recorded in a single take and "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" was recorded in one take after a single false start[5][2] (the false start can be heard on both the 6-disc and 18-disc versions of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965â€“1966, released in 2015).
