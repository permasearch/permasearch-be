Much like What's Going On, Let's Get It On has been included in a significant number of "best album" lists by critics and publications.[19] It was ranked number 58 on The Times's 1993 publication of the 100 Best Albums of All Time.[32] Blender magazine ranked the album number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time.[19] In 2003, it was ranked number 165 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time publication, his second highest entry on the list,[33] as well as one of three Marvin Gaye albums to be included; What's Going On (number 6) and Here, My Dear (number 462).[34] Let's Get It On was reissued that same year by Universal Music; the re-release was later given a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry.[35] In 2004, Let's Get It On was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of "historical significance".[36]
