Additionally, a change to the F-Series naming scheme would remain in place to the present day. The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the North American F-100 Super Sabre); the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the F-250 while the F-4 became the F-350. Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were C-Series trucks.
