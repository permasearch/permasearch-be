In the book The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture: From Godzilla to Miyazaki, author Mark I. West describes Misty, a protagonist of the anime, as a mother figure, adding that her motherly instincts are seen more in how she takes care of Togepi, who he describes as an "overactive toddler" who requires constant care.[20] Author Gerard Jones commented that Togepi was a good Pokémon for Pokémon fans who fantasize about taking care of babies.[21] In the book Media And the Make-Believe Worlds of Children: When Harry Potter Meets Pokémon in Disneyland, author Maya Götz describes a discussion with a girl named Patricia who dreams of Togepi as her friend, calling it a "moon manikin" who lives on the moon, flying back and forth from the "land of milk and honey". Maya suggests that Patricia dreams back to an early phase in her life that is symbolized by the "newly-hatched Togepi, needing protection."[22] The Independent Collegian used the scene of Professor Elm's Aide giving Togepi to the players as a scene that will immediately bring back memories to die-hard Pokémon fans.[23]
