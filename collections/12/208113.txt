Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004.[178] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production.[178] In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue.[179] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue.[180] The Agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce.[181] According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes.[182]
