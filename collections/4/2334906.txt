Following its original release as a single, the song has not appeared on any Steve Harley compilations. However, in 1994, the extended remix version appeared on the Canadian various artists compilation Hardest Hits, Vol. 3 from SPG. In 2003, the CD was included as part of a three disc set titled Hardest Hits. This appearance is the only one outside of the single, and therefore the only on CD.[13]
