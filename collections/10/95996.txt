Some successes were achieved in the 1850s, including the Maine law, adopted in 1851, which banned the manufacture and sale of liquor. Before its repeal in 1856, 12 states followed the example set by Maine in total prohibition.[26] The temperance movement lost strength and was marginalized during the American Civil War (1861â€“1865).
