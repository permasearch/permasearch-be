The Democratic Primary took place on September 12, 2017. Incumbent mayor Lovely A. Warren defeated former police chief and current county legislator James Sheppard as well as former journalist Rachel Barnhart, and though Sheppard had secured the nomination of the Independence Party of New York and the Working Families Party, he stated that his campaign "was finished" following the primary.[1]
