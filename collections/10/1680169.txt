The faceted eyes of S.Â coleoptrata are sensitive to daylight and very sensitive to ultraviolet light.[9] They were shown to be able visually to distinguish between different mutations of Drosophila melanogaster.[10] How this ability fits with its nocturnal lifestyle and underground natural habitat is still under study. They do not instantly change direction when light is suddenly shone at them, but will retreat to a darker hiding spot.
