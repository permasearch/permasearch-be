The role of Reverend Paul Coates was written with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, and was the first role cast.[27][28] Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final appearance on Doctor Who.[27] Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and what are the implications of the circumstances that the town is put in," said Darvill, "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young."[28] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect.[28] Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. "Early on I knew it was going to be good because Chris said...[e]veryone has to be nice and good."[29]
