The first official pictures of the film set were released on April 23, 2014,[222] followed by the release of the first film stills in June 2014.[223] During the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014, 500 copies of a limited-edition Jurassic World poster by Mark Englert were given out at the convention.[224][225] Audiences at the convention were disappointed by the lack of Jurassic World footage; what they initially believed to be footage for the film was actually a teaser trailer announcement for Legendary Pictures' upcoming film, Skull Island.[226][227][228]
