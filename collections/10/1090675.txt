Gerhard Berger returned to Ferrari to partner Alesi in 1993. Jean Todt was hired as team principal. With the Ferrari 412T, Berger and Alesi proved the car's competitiveness throughout the two seasons, with a brace of podium places and four pole positions. Bad luck limited the number of wins to one each for both Berger (1994 German Grand Prix) and Alesi (1995 Canadian Grand Prix), particularly Alesi who was in a position to win at Monza and the NÃ¼rburgring in 1995, but the car was a solid and competitive proposition. Berger's win, achieved after three seasons without any triumph in a race, set a record of at least one victory in a season during the following twenty consecutive seasons.
