Beginning with George Washington, slaves prepared food for American presidents, First Families, and for social gatherings.[1] Although slavery ended in the United States after the American Civil War, African Americans continued to provide nearly all the cooking in the White House kitchen. Occasionally, a professional chef was used beginning in the latter half of the 1800s.[2] President Ulysses S. Grant utilized a Union Army cook until his embarrassed wife forced him to hire an Italian-trained chef.[3] President Rutherford B. Hayes utilized the services of cook and nurse Winnie Monroe, a freed African American slave.[4] Chester Arthur used a cook who formerly worked at his private residence as his White House chef for casual dining, and hired French-trained professional chef Alexander Fortin to oversee preparation of important political meals and state dinners.[5][6] President Grover Cleveland also used a French chef to prepare his meals during his first term.[7] President Benjamin Harrison had a French chef as well, but fired him after only a short time in favor of the services of Dolly Johnson, a freed African American slave who had cooked for the Harrisons in Indianapolis.[8] President William McKinley hired a local cook for everyday dining, but a French-trained chef traveled from New York City to prepare formal dinners.[9]
