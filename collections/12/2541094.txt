At the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation, inviting Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and saying "I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs". Edison thanked him but said "My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time"[62]
