He appears in the Season 2 premiere, "The Mutation Situation". Still deeply afraid of the Kraang and further plagued by nightmares of his abduction, Kirby refuses to let April even leave the house, wondering if the Kraang are still out there. At night, he joins April on the roof, thinking that she needs his help for a school project. Unfortunately, he gets mutated into a bat while protecting his daughter from one of the dozens of mutagen canisters falling all over New York City. His mutation prompts an angry April to sever her ties with the Turtles for some time.
