The population question is a complex issue, as can be seen by the above considerations. Much hinges on interpretation of two locations at Qumranâ€”the refectory and the pantry. The search for extramural dwelling quarters has failed to provide substantial evidence. Discounting Laperrousaz's apparently excessively high estimate, a number of proposals put the population in and around Qumran at between 20 and 200 people.
