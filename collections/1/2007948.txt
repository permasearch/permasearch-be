Loretta is Freddy Krueger's wife and the mother of Katherine Krueger/Maggie Burroughs. She met Freddy in high school and they married in 1960, when they were still teenagers. Their daughter, Katherine, was born in 1961. It was obvious that she loved her husband and daughter dearly. It seemed that Freddy loved her back, as he was seen trying to lead a normal life for the sake of her and their child. However, his murderous nature got the better of him. One day, she accidentally discovered the evidence of Freddy's child killings. Although she promised she would not tell, she was strangled to death by Freddy in front of their then five-year-old daughter.[8]
