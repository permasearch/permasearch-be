Implementation of fluoridation was held up by preliminary dental surveying and water testing,[85] and a court case, Ryan v. Attorney General.[86] In 1965, the Supreme Court rejected Gladys Ryan's claim that the Act violated the Constitution of Ireland's guarantee of the right to bodily integrity.[86][87] By 1965, Greater Dublin's water was fluoridated; by 1973, other urban centers were.[88] Studies from the late 1970s to mid 1990s showed a higher decrease in (and lower incidence of) dental decay in school children living in areas where water was fluoridated than in areas where water was not fluoridated.[89]
