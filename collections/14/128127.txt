The 1971 Triumph V8 used the Slant 4 engine as its starting point. Initially it was to be fitted with fuel injection, but due to lack of funds at parent company Leyland Motors, the system was never perfected and twin carburettors were used instead. Low quality manufacturing garnered the engine a poor reputation and the 3.0 L (183 cu in) V8 was used only in the Triumph Stag.
