Because of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to Perl'sâ€”for example, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's .NET Framework, and XML Schema. Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages, for example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in PCRE and Python.[28]
