According to McGregor, there are two opposing approaches to implementing Theory X: the hard approach and the soft approach.[7] The hard approach depends on close supervision, intimidation, and immediate punishment.[5] This approach can potentially yield a hostile, minimally cooperative workforce that may cause resentment towards management.[6] Managers are always looking for mistakes from employees, because they do not trust their work.[6] Theory X is a "we versus they" approach, meaning it is the management versus the employees.[6]
