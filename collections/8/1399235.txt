On the bridge, Beyoncé sings about having drunken sex in the kitchen: "We woke up in the kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding off in that club".[30] The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her.[25] Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner.[36] He forgoes subtlety as he raps, "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast".[25][27][37] Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house.[38] During his lines, he raps about "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.[39]
