These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane, at angles which are multiples of     2 π  /  n   {\displaystyle 2\pi /n}  .  For example, the square roots of unity are 1 and −1, and the fourth roots of unity are 1,     i   {\displaystyle i}  , −1, and     − i   {\displaystyle -i}  .
