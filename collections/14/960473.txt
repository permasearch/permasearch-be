Mother Gothel is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 50th animated feature film Tangled (2010) as the main antagonist. The character is voiced by American actress and singer Donna Murphy in her voice-acting debut, prior to which she was predominantly known as a stage actress. Upon learning from her agent that Disney was auditioning potentials for the antagonistic role of Mother Gothel, Murphy decided to audition for the part spontaneously. Loosely based on Dame Gothel in the German fairy tale "Rapunzel", Mother Gothel is a vain old woman who hoards the healing powers of a magical flower in order to remain young and beautiful forever. When the flower is suddenly harvested by the kingdom in order to heal its ailing queen, its rejuvenating powers are inherited by the king and the queen's daughter, Princess Rapunzel, stripping Gothel of her access to it. With her life suddenly endangered, Gothel kidnaps the baby, imprisoning the young Princess Rapunzel in an isolated tower for eighteen years while masquerading as her mother.
