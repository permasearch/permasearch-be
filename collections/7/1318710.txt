Bangalore generates about 3,000 tonnes of solid waste per day, of which about 1,139 tonnes are collected and sent to composting units such as the Karnataka Composting Development Corporation. The remaining solid waste collected by the municipality is dumped in open spaces or on roadsides outside the city.[127] In 2008, Bangalore produced around 2,500Â metric tonnes of solid waste, and increased to 5000 metric tonnes in 2012, which is transported from collection units located near Hesaraghatta Lake, to the garbage dumping sites.[128] The city suffers significantly with dust pollution, hazardous waste disposal, and disorganised, unscientific waste retrievals.[129] The IT hub, Whitefield region is the most polluted area in Bangalore.[130] Recently a study found that over 36% of diesel vehicles in the city exceed the national limit for emissions.[131]
