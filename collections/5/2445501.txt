In January 2018, Musk was granted a $2.6 billion award by the company, awarding him with 20.3 million shares and could raise Tesla's market value to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval is pending.[103] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[104] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. to clients argued against granting the award.[103] Despite what the New York Post described as an "astronomical deal" in pay, Musk accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project, a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area. The money was used to build a factory and infrastructure for solar panel maker SolarCity, which Tesla acquired. As of March 2018, the plant employed "just a few hundred workers and its future remains uncertain." (The Buffalo area actually lost nearly 5,000 jobs between December 2016 and December 2017).[105]
