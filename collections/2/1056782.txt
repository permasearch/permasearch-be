Castlevania is an American adult animated web television series based on the 1989 video game Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse by Konami. The series follows Trevor Belmont, who defends the nation of Wallachia from Dracula and his minions. Originally planned as a film with a script written by Warren Ellis in 2007, the project entered development hell until about 2015, where it was finally funded with help from animation studios Frederator Studios and Powerhouse Animation Studios, along with Netflix. Its art style is heavily influenced by that of Japanese anime and Ayami Kojima's artwork in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.[1] The series premiered on the Netflix streaming service on July 7, 2017,[2] and was renewed for an expanded second season of eight episodes on the same day.[3]
