In the version 1.0 of Unicode the character â‚§ U+20A7 PESETA SIGN had two reference glyphs: a "Pts" ligature glyph as in IBM code page 437 and an erroneous P with stroke. In Unicode 2.0 the reference glyph P with stroke was erroneously displayed as the only symbol for peseta[1] and was latter corrected to the Pts ligature and a separate character code was added for the peso sign.
