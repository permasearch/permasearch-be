The SNP repeated its commitment to hold a referendum when it published its 2011 Scottish parliamentary election manifesto.[20] Days before the election, Salmond stated that legislation for a referendum would be proposed in the "2nd half of the parliament", as he wanted to secure more powers for the Scottish Parliament via the Scotland Bill first.[21] The SNP gained an overall majority in the election, winning 69 from 129 seats, thereby gaining a mandate to hold an independence referendum.[22][23]
