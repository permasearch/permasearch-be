The management team is especially important because it coordinates the recovery process. The team assesses the disaster, activates the recovery plan, and contacts team managers. The management team also oversees, documents and monitors the recovery process. It is helpful when management team members are the final decision-makers in setting priorities, policies and procedures. Each team has specific responsibilities that are completed to ensure successful execution of the plan. The teams have an assigned manager and an alternate in case the team manager is not available. Other team members may also have specific assignments where possible.
