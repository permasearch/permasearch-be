The first Canadian station was XWA, an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montréal. It began its broadcasts in late 1919 and continued them during 1920. In November 1922, the station was assigned the call letters of CFCF—which stood for Canada's First.[3] In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the Toronto Star newspaper. The station first used the transmitter and call letters of the Canadian Independent Telephone Company's experimental station 9AH (later CKCE) on March 19, 1922, with a series of broadcasts of concerts[4]
