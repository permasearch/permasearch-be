Often referred to as the "Jewel of the Texas League" (probably a moniker given the facility when it was new in 1994), Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium is the oldest in-use ballpark in the Texas League. The ballpark seats more than 6,200 and holds more than 9,000 spectators with additional outfield grass berm seating. The team has sought a new stadium since 2009, and continues to do so as the team prepares to move to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 2019.
