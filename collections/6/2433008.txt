The new Palace surrounded the old brick chateau, with new wings the north, south and to the rear. The facade, like the new Louvre wing, featured colossal order columns, while the roof was flat with a terrance, decorated with balustrades, pilasters, balconies, statues, and trophies. Beginning in 1674-75, Le Brun created the interior, including the most famous room in the Palace, the Hall of Mirrors, which overlooked the new garden. A small army of painters, sculptors, and decorators went to work, using marble, polychrome stone, bronze. mirrors and gilded stucco. Le Brun himself painted the ceiling. The Hall of Mirrors became the symbol of the entire French Baroque style. The new Palace was open to almost any visitor, and became an immense theater, where the King carried out his ceremonies, with meticulous protocol, in public view. [7]
