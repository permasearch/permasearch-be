Soybeans were mentioned as kadêlê (modern Indonesian term: kedelai)[79] in an old Javanese manuscript, Serat Sri Tanjung, which dates around the 12th to 13th century Java.[80] By the 13th century, the soybean had arrived and cultivated in Indonesia; it probably arrived much earlier however, carried by traders or merchants from Southern China.[81]
