When he was a child still living in Russian-occupied Poland, Rickover was not allowed to attend public schools because of his Jewish faith. Starting at the age of four, he attended a religious school where the teaching was solely from the Tanakh, i.e., Old Testament, in Hebrew.[56] Following his formal education in the U.S.,[57] Admiral Rickover developed a decades-long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the United States.[58]
