Deductive reasoning allows deriving     b   {\displaystyle b}   from     a   {\displaystyle a}   only where     b   {\displaystyle b}   is a formal logical consequence of     a   {\displaystyle a}  . In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that "Wikis can be edited by anyone" (     a  1     {\displaystyle a_{1}}  ) and "Wikipedia is a wiki" (     a  2     {\displaystyle a_{2}}  ), it follows that "Wikipedia can be edited by anyone" (    b   {\displaystyle b}  ).
