Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense.[130] Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father.[131] He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women.[132] Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15.[3] As Richard later explained in 2010, "my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay."[133] He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia.[134]
