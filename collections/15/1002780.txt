Across Europe medical schools relied primarily on lectures and readings.  The final year student would have limited clinical experience by trailing the professor through the wards.  Laboratory work was uncommon, and dissections were rarely done because of legal restrictions on cadavers.  Most schools were small, and only Edinburgh, Scotland, with 11,000 alumni, produced large numbers of graduates.[98][99]
