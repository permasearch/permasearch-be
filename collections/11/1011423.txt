Auckland (/ˈɔːklənd/ AWK-lənd) is a city in New Zealand's North Island. Auckland is the largest urban area in the country, with an urban population of around 1,534,700.[4] It is located in the Auckland Region—the area governed by Auckland Council—which includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of 1,657,200.[4] A diverse and multicultural city, Auckland is home to the largest Polynesian population in the world.[5] The Māori-language name for Auckland is Tāmaki (pronounced [ˈtaːmaki]) or Tāmaki-makau-rau, meaning "Tāmaki with a hundred lovers", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions.[6] It has also been called Ākarana, a transliteration of the English name.
