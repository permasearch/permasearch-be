When the interaction energies      J  1     {\displaystyle J_{1}}  ,      J  2     {\displaystyle J_{2}}   are both negative, the Ising model becomes an antiferromagnet. Since the square lattice is bi-partite, it is invariant under this change when the magnetic field     h = 0   {\displaystyle h=0}  , so the free energy and critical temperature are the same for the antiferromagnetic case. For the triangular lattice, which is not bi-partite, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Ising model behave notably differently.
