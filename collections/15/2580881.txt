The Colony of New Zealand was a British colony that existed in New Zealand from 1841 to 1907. Originally created as a Crown colony, the power of the British government was vested in a governor. The colony was granted self-government in 1852; after the first parliament was elected in 1853, the 1852 Constitution was inaugurated. The first responsible government of New Zealand was formed in 1856. The Colony of New Zealand had three capitals: Old Russell (1841), Auckland (1841â€“1865) and Wellington (after 1865).
