Milivi Adams was a girl from Vieques who developed and died of cancer and became a symbol in the battle against the presence of the military.[23][24] Her face had appeared many times on the covers of Puerto Rican newspapers and magazines, and there were posters with her picture on them on many of Vieques' street corners.[citation needed] The daughter of Zuleyka Calderon and Jose Adams,[25] Milivi was diagnosed with cancer at the age of two years. Although many people blamed the military's bomb testings in Vieques as the source of her cancer, this has not been proven.[26] Given a month to live at the age of three, her cancer went into remission, but at the age of four reappeared, in her brain. She was flown to the United States by her parents, in hopes that treatment would help her; she fought infections, and after the last one, doctors told her parents that her body would not resist another infection treatment. She returned to Puerto Rico, where she died on the morning of NovemberÂ 17, 2002.[27]
