The cane toad is very large;[22] the females are significantly longer than males,[23] reaching an average length of 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in),[22] with a maximum of 24 cm (9.4 in).[5]  Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density.[24] They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years in the wild,[25] and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35 years.[26]
