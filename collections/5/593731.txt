When Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype; he used the phrase "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for biological development. Waddington held that cell fates were established in development (canalisation) much as a marble rolls down to the point of lowest local elevation.[14]
