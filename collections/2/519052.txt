Assuming that factor prices are constant, the production function determines all cost functions.[4] The variable cost curve is the inverted short-run production function or total product curve and its behavior and properties are determined by the production function.[3]:209 [nb 1] Because the production function determines the variable cost function it necessarily determines the shape and properties of marginal cost curve and the average cost curves.[4]
