The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits Star Wars for launching the Star Trek films.[27] He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 Star Trek fan convention in Las Vegas by stating "Star Wars created Star Trek". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first Star Wars film (A New Hope), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A Star Trek relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to Star Trek.[28] "It was 'Star Wars' that thrust 'Star Trek' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" he stated.[29][30]
