As the project proceeded, Goodwin lost influence with National Park Service director Stephen Mather, who favored landscape architect Thomas Chalmers Vint's alternative routing of the upper portion of the road along the Garden Wall escarpment.  Vint's alignment reduced both switchbacks and the road's visual impact, at increased cost.[9]  With Goodwin's resignation, Vint's proposal became the preferred alignment.  The entire project was finally opened from end to end in 1933, at a cost of $2.5 million.[10]
