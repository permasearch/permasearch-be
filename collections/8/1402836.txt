Initially, Christian is the chief of surgery at St. Sebastian Hospital. He is a recovering alcoholic. He marries Margo (Veronica Hamel), and the two have one child together, Jack. When Jack comes home following a bullying incident, Christian discourages Jack from trying to be heroic, saying that he doesn't have what it takes.[1] Years later, Christian meets Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), a woman from Sydney, Australia. The two have a brief relationship before she returned to her home country, and later she gives birth to Christian's daughter, Claire (Emilie de Ravin). Christian would often fly over to visit, supporting the two the best he could. Carole and her sister, Lindsey (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), do not approve of him juggling time between two families, which leads to Christian being told he is no longer allowed to visit.[2]
