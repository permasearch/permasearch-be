Backed by Harrison, Voormann and Keltner, among others, Starr performed "It Don't Come Easy" at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, forgetting some of the words.[5] While this live recording was included on the Concert for Bangladesh triple album, the studio version remained unavailable on an LP until the release of Starr's 1975 Apple greatest hits compilation, Blast from Your Past.[18] The song was also heard in the 1978 NBC-TV special Ringo. Although Starr recorded new versions of several songs for the special, the released recording of "It Don't Come Easy" was used.
