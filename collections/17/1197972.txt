Gadot's performance received positive feedback from critics. In a 2017 article, Heavy.com's Brendan Marrow listed Yashar as one of Gadot's best performances prior to her starring role as Wonder Woman in the 2017 film of the same name.[18] Oâ€™Keefe of Decider described Gadot and her character as the "secret weapon" of The Fast and The Furious franchise, praising the actress for her "totally kickass contribution to the bonkers, high-octane, super-charged [films]". O'Keefe described Gadot's performance as "balanc[ing] unbridled badassery with unabashedly feminine charm".[12] Joe Reid of the same publication recommended that Yashar should be revived for future installments of the franchise, but questioned if the producers would be able to afford to have Gadot return for another film.[19] Echoing Reid's sentiments, Bucksbaum campaigned for the character's return, and wrote that she could likely be featured in a future film through a flashback sequence.[15]
