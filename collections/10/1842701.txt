Harrington and Tom Kahn had been associated with Max Shachtman, a Marxist theorist, who had broken with Trotsky,[106] because of his criticism of the Soviet Union as being a totalitarian class-society after having supported Trotsky in the 1930s.[107][108] Although Max Schachtman died in 1972 before the Socialist Party was renamed as SDUSA, Shachtman's ideas continued to influence the Albert Shanker and The American Federation of Teachers, which was often associated with SDUSA members. Decades later, conflicts in the AFL-CIO were roughly split along the lines of the conflict between the "Shachtmanite Social Democrats and the Harringtonite Democratic Socialists of America, with the Social Democrats supporting Kirkland and Donahue and the Democratic Socialists supporting Sweeney",[109] in 1995.[110]
