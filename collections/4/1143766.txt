Initially a different composer, Stephen Warbeck, was hired for the pilot episode of Game of Thrones but he left the project.[6] The music consultant for HBO and music supervisor of Game of Thrones Evyen Klean then suggested Ramin Djawadi to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.[7] Djawadi, although initially interested, declined the offer three days later as the schedule conflicted with a film he was working on. Djawadi was nevertheless persuaded to take on the project after a few meetings.[8] The showrunners Benioff and Weiss sent Djawadi the first two episodes of the series, which Djawadi was impressed by, and so arranged a meeting with Benioff and Weiss to discuss the concept of the series, after which he began to compose the music for the series.[2][9] According to Djawadi, Benioff and Weiss wanted the different characters and plots to be musically supported.[10] They decided that the music would be used to express the emotion and mood of each scene in the series, and that distinct themes would be created for some of the main characters.[11] Benioff and Weiss also wanted a soundscape that is distinct from other productions in the fantasy genre, therefore flutes and solo vocals were initially avoided, and cello became a prominent feature of the music of Game of Thrones, notably in its title theme.[12]
