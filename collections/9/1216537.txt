The hardline mechanic's tools (wrenches, ratchets, and sockets) that make up the core of the brand have been made by a variety of manufacturers over the years, including New Britain,[17] Moore Drop Forging,[2] Stanley,[18] Easco Hand Tools,[19] Danaher Corporation, and most recently Apex Tool Group. Screwdrivers have been manufactured by Pratt-Read and Western Forge, but are now supplied mostly exclusively by Western Forge, who also supply pliers and adjustable wrenches.[20]
