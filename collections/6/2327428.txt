Marxism is a methodology of philosophical, sociological, political and economic analysis that explores class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. Marxist theory originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
