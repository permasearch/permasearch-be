It also had religious significance. In the Scirophoria, the feast of Athene Sciras, a white parasol was borne by the priestesses of the goddess from the Acropolis to the Phalerus. In the feasts of Dionysos, the umbrella was used, and in an old bas-relief, the same god is represented as descending ad inferos with a small umbrella in his hand. In the PanathenÃ¦a, the daughters of the Metics, or foreign residents, carried parasols over the heads of Athenian women as a mark of inferiority.
