Khrushchev sought to eliminate many conventional weapons, and defend the Soviet Union with missiles.[191] He believed that unless this occurred, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve.[192] In 1955, Khrushchev abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack.[193] In January 1960, Khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops.[194] While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.[195]
