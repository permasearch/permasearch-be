Locke delivers Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to Lord Roose Bolton. Bolton, furious that his men have maimed a valuable hostage, frees Brienne and orders his men to take Jaime to see Qyburn, a maester who was stripped of his chain. Qyburn treats Jaime's right forearm; Jaime requests that he do so without analgesics. Later, Jaime is taken to the baths, where Brienne is already bathing. Jaime then tells her of Robert's Rebellion, the "Mad King" Aerys Targaryen, and the Mad King's plot to burn all of King's Landing using caches of wildfire hidden by a pyromancer through the city during the Sack of King's Landing. Jaime reveals that he slew the Mad King to save the city, its people and his own father's life.
