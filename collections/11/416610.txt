Following Stefán's announcement in October 2016 that he had been diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma,[1][2][3][4] a GoFundMe campaign was created by LazyTown head writer Mark Valenti to pay his living costs when he fell too ill to work. The campaign was popularized by various YouTube users uploading parodies of Stefán's work, which led to the songs "We Are Number One" and "The Mine Song" from LazyTown becoming an Internet meme.[5] On 11 August 2017, Stefán was announced as cured from cancer in an interview with RÚV.[6] Furthermore, Stefán has clarified on his campaign on GoFundMe that while his metastases have been removed after successful liver surgery in June 2017, he still has the disease and has refused further adjuvant therapy.[7] However, in March 2018, Stefán was diagnosed with inoperable terminal cancer, and is currently on chemotherapy to attempt to prolong his life.[8]
