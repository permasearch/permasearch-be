where we impose periodic boundary conditions on        B ^      {\displaystyle {\hat {B}}}  . Note that the definition of        A ^      {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}}   depends on our choice to have     θ   {\displaystyle \theta }   range from 0 to     2 π   {\displaystyle 2\pi }  . These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators,     [    A ^    ,    B ^    ] = i ℏ   {\displaystyle [{\hat {A}},{\hat {B}}]=i\hbar }  .[31]
