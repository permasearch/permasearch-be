Aside from championships, he was the 1987 WWF King of the Ring and the 1995 WCW World War 3 winner. A major pay-per-view attraction in the 1980s and 1990s, Savage headlined WrestleManias IV, V and VIII (being part of a double main event at the last of those presentations),[12] as well as four of the first five SummerSlam shows, the 1995 edition of WCW's Starrcade, and many other events. At the peak of his popularity, he held similar drawing power to that of Hulk Hogan.[13][14] He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015.
