In 1831, however, a British order was recreated by European aristocrats claiming (possibly without authority) to be acting on behalf of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.[58] This order in time became known as the Most Venerable Order of Saint John, receiving a royal charter from Queen Victoria in 1888, before expanding throughout the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth, and the United States. Today, the best-known activities of this order are the St. John Ambulance Brigade in Britain and the Commonwealth and the Saint John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem.[59] The Most Venerable Order of Saint John has maintained a presence in Malta since the late 19th century. In contrast with the orders originating with the mediaeval Knights Hospitaller, the British organisation no longer limits its membership to Christians.
