A 2003 study conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Justice found the Duluth Model to have "little or no effect."[10] However, this study had considerable shortfalls. The National Institute of Justice said in its introduction, "...response rates were low, many people dropped out of the program, and victims could not be found for subsequent interviews. The tests used to measure batterers' attitudes toward domestic violence and their likelihood to engage in future abuse were of questionable validity."[11]
