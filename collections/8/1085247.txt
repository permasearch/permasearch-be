This star is primarily composed of a carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star.[12] This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity.[104] The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.[105]
