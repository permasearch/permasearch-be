"There was little experience moving bulk loads by carts, while a packhorse would [i.e. 'could'] carry only an eighth of a ton. On a soft road a horse might be able to draw 5/8ths of a ton. But if the load were carried by a barge on a waterway, then up to 30 tons could be drawn by the same horse â€”technology historian Ronald W. Clark referring to transport realities before the industrial revolution and the Canal age.."[3]
