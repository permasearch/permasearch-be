Differentiated somatic cells of adult mammals generally replicate infrequently or not at all.  Such cells, including, for example, brain neurons and muscle myocytes, have little or no cell turnover.  Non-replicating cells do not generally generate mutations due to DNA damage-induced errors of replication.  These non-replicating cells do not commonly give rise to cancer, but they do accumulate DNA damages with time that likely contribute to aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).  In a non-replicating cell, a single-strand break or other type of damage in the transcribed strand of DNA can block RNA polymerase II catalysed transcription.[82] This would interfere with the synthesis of the protein coded for by the gene in which the blockage occurred.
