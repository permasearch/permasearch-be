Online certification or "seal" programs are an example of industry self-regulation of privacy policies. Seal programs usually require implementation of fair information practices as determined by the certification program and may require continued compliance monitoring. TRUSTe,[35] the first online privacy seal program, included more than 1,800 members by 2007[36] Other online seal programs include the Trust Guard Privacy Verified program,[37] eTrust,[38] and Webtrust.[39]
