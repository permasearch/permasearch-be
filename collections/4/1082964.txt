The annual Fourth Plinth Schools Award is the education project within the Mayor of Londonâ€™s Fourth Plinth Programme. The award uses the Fourth Plinth as an inspiration to engage primary and secondary schools in London to enter a competition that encourages creative thinking around past and present artworks displayed on the Fourth Plinth.[35]
