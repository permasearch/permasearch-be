Although Sirius is the brightest proper star in the night sky, it is 8.7 light-years (8.23×1013 km) away from Earth and it has no effect whatsoever on the weather or temperature.[5][36] Although the star continues to return to the night sky in the late summer, its position continues to slowly shift relative to the sun and will rise in the middle of winter in about 10,000 years.[5]
