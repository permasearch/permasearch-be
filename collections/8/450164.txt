The programme of study for the common law LL.B. is an undergraduate, professional degree. It is now replaced by the J.D. at nearly all Canadian common law schools (McGill being the exception). While the degree awarded is at the first-degree level and admission may be granted to applicants with two or three years of undergraduate studies towards a degree, in practice, entrants to the programme generally hold an  undergraduate degree before registration in the law programme. A significant number hold a graduate level degree as well. (See Juris Doctor in Canada)
