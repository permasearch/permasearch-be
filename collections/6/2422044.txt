"Linda was a wonderfully cooperative young lady that needed direction. Had no technique and no real acting experience. She was engaged to marry Dick Zanuck. So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing for her to do in this one, except just be part of the sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – and I think she came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand what these people were trying to communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. So I gave her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully."[7]
