Rodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002,[24] becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Iván Rodríguez (2000), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). He had the 6th-most home runs in AL history, the most since Roger Maris' league record 61 in 1961 and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year. He won the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season.[52] He also won his first Gold Glove Award, awarded for outstanding defense.
