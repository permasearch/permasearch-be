The total network bandwidth depends on how dispersive the medium is (more dispersive medium generally has better total bandwidth because it minimises interference), how many frequencies are available, how noisy those frequencies are, how many aerials are used and whether a directional antenna is in use, whether nodes employ power control and so on. there are two bands for now 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. mostly 5 gigahertz band gives better connection and speed.
