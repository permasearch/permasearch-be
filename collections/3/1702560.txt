Up until the 20th century, most independent nations in the civilized world were monarchies and therefore used the monarchistic style of coat of arms. This style is illustrated below by the Swedish Greater Arms and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom[a], both of which are still in use. Characteristic of this style are the escutcheon (shield) of the kingdom, the supporters on either side (usually beasts as in these cases, but may also be birds, fishes, humans/humanoids or even inanimate objects as depicted on the coat of arms of Spain) and the crown topping the arms. The crown on the UK arms is specifically St Edward's Crown.[a] Both also feature a symbol of the monarch's chivalric order encircling the escutcheon: the chain of the Order of the Seraphim on the Swedish arms and the belt of the Order of the Garter on the UK arms.[a] A motto is often present either below or above the escutcheon (as shown on the UK arms); this is absent on the Swedish arms. In common with many European monarchies, the Swedish arms features a representation of a royal robe (see mantle and pavilion) topped with another crown, which became common around the 19th century (and which can also be seen in the Romanian arms below); This type of mantle does not feature at all in British heraldry. The Swedish arms also feature an inescutcheon, a secondary escutcheon within the main one which represents (in this case) the monarch's dynasty, although they may also represent other things. The UK arms feature a helmet with mantling and crest which are absent from the Swedish arms. These features were all commonly used among the arms of European kingdoms.
