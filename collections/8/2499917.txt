ExxonMobil developed a process in which benzene is hydroalkylated to cyclohexylbenzene. This latter product is oxidized to a hydroperoxide and then cleaved to phenol and cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone is an important reaction intermediate for making nylon.[21] Therefore, this newer process without producing the acetone by-product appears attractive and is similar to the Cumene Process as a hydroperoxide is formed and then decomposed to yield two key products.[19]
