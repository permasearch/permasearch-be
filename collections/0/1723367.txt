From 1966 until after they signed to Epic in 1967, the band had their most concentrated success in the US, including four Top 15 songs ("Bus Stop", "Stop Stop Stop",[20] "On a Carousel", and "Carrie Anne"). The move to Epic followed by Graham Nash's departure ended this streak; after that, the Hollies had a few more huge hits: "He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother" (No.7, 1969), "Long Cool Woman" (No.2, 1972), and "The Air That I Breathe" (No.6, 1974).  They did have additional US chart hits with the non-UK singles "Pay You Back With Interest" (No.28 in 1966), "Dear Eloise" (No.50 in 1967), "Long Dark Road" (No.26 in 1972), and the "reunion" single "Stop! In the Name of Love" (No.29 in 1983).
