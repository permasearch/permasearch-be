Phencyclidine (PCP), also known as angel dust among other names, is a drug used for its mind-altering effects.[5] PCP may cause hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds, and violent behavior.[7][8] As a recreational drug, it is typically smoked, but may be taken by mouth, snorted, or injected.[7][4] It may also be mixed with cannabis or tobacco.[5]
