While official report was actually the summary of the sporting events held at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and so can not be considered as reliable source,[7] the IOC states that 24 nations participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris,[8] but additional sources list up to 28 nations, with Haiti, Iran, Luxembourg, and Peru being the additions.[9][10] The 1904 Games, held in St. Louis, were poorly organized, with participation of only 12 nations,[11][12] and many events contested only by athletes from the host United States. Although the Intercalated Games of 1906 are no longer considered official Games of the Olympiad by the IOC, they helped restore the Olympic movement. Participation at subsequent Games grew steadily, with 22 nations in London for 1908[13] and 28 nations in Stockholm for the 1912 Games.[14] At these two Games (only), one of the delegations was actually a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand, designated Australasia. The Games of 1916, planned for Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I.
