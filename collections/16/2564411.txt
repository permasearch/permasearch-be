Downtown Los Angeles has numerous public escalators and skyways, such as the Bunker Hill steps[33] to facilitate pedestrian traffic in the traffic-laden and hilly terrain. Downtown Los Angeles is one of two neighborhoods in Los Angeles ranked as a "walker's paradise" (with walk scores 90 or above) by Walkscore.  The other is Mid-City West, which encompasses the area of the city immediately south of West Hollywood and east of Beverly Hills.[34]
