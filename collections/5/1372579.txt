The Black Stars as it stands now has no official head because of corrupt practices by the then president, Kwesi Nyantakyi.[19] and vice-president George Afriyie,[20] with Frank Davis as director of football, and Edward Bawa as treasurer.[21] The Ghana Football Association (GFA) signed a CNÂ¥92.2 million (US$15 million) deal with Ghanaian state-run oil and gas exploration corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), to sponsor the Black Stars and the renewable contract saw the oil and gas exploration corporation become the global headline sponsor of the Black Stars, with a yearly Black Stars player salary wage bill,[22][23] following the gold mining corporations Ashanti Goldfields Corporation and Goldfields Ghana Limited (GGL), which had been sponsoring the Black Stars since 2005.[24]
