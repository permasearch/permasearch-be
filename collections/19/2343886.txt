While Dr. Smith, Will and the Robot searching for rubies, they encounter a super-android who identifies himself as IDAK (Instant Destroyer and Killer) and walks around shouting "Crush!  Kill!  Destroy!". Thinking the machine could be useful to him, Smith tries to draw up a service contract. Meanwhile, the female android Verda returns to the Robinsons after escaping a disassembly order, and she warns them of the android that was sent to destroy her. When IDAK detects Verda's presence, he goes after her, but the family is determined to save Verda by playing off the destroyer's human emotions. Unbeknownst to everyone, a second IDAK – one stronger and unsusceptible to human feelings – is sent to replace the flawed IDAK.
