McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about $100 in winnings (equivalent to $900 in 2016).[3][18] He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC's Jukebox Jury, that aired in the 1953â€“1954 season.[19]
