When Roarke was sixteen, he was running a small gambling ring. His competitors wanted him gone and having failed to warn him off, they figured that the best way to deliver the message was through Marlena, Summerset's daughter, then aged fourteen. The six men raped, murdered, and mutilated Marlena, and then dumped her corpse on Summerset's doorstep. In revenge, Roarke hunted down and killed those six men over the next decade. These acts form the basis for the plot in Vengeance in Death. When he comes to the U.S., he brings Summerset with him, asking Summerset to become his home's majordomo. In reality, Roarke thinks of Summerset as a father.
