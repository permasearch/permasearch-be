In the series three (December 2014) opener, set on Valentine's Day the following year, Caroline proposes marriage to Kate, wishing to make their union official. She is faced with hostility both from Celia, who is prejudiced about Caroline's new family unit, and from bullies at her school who target Lawrence.[24] A depressed Celia uses the discovery of Alan's illegitimate son Gary (Rupert Graves) as an excuse not to attend the wedding. When Alan turns up at the wedding alone, Caroline lashes out at him, telling him that there is now no point him being there.[25] In episode three (2015), Kate and Caroline exchange vows in the company of friends and colleagues. Caroline is devastated when Kate is fatally injured in a car-accident the next day. Alan and Celia arrive at the hospital to emotionally support Caroline; they learn that Kate's daughter has been delivered alive.[26] Caroline struggles to manage her grief following Kate's funeral, and begins imagining conversations with her deceased spouse. Unwilling to give up her career to become a full-time single mother, she hires an ex-pupil Holly (Cara Theobold) to become baby Flora's nanny.[27] In episode five Caroline is incredulous when, six weeks after Kate's death, John suggests they get back together. When Holly is revealed to be an alcoholic, Caroline turns to Flora's biological father to help out with childcare.[28]
