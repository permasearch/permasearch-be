Flowers for Algernon is on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990â€“1999 at number 43.[6] The reasons for the challenges vary, but usually center on those parts of the novel in which Charlie struggles to understand and express his sexual desires.[8] Many of the challenges have proved unsuccessful, but the book has occasionally been removed from school libraries, including some in Pennsylvania and Texas.[8][28]
