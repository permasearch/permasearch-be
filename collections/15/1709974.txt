The geologic time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.[9] It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first Solar System material at 4.567 Ga[10] (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at 4.54 Ga[11][12] (4.54 billion years), which is the beginning of the informally recognized Hadean eon – a division of geologic time. At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the present day (in the Holocene epoch).
