There are 36 passenger gondolas, of which 34 are in use at any one time, with a maximum capacity of 10 passengers each.[22] All passenger gondolas are ready for disabled persons using wheelchairs, including those ones with leg rest extensions. There are also two (open) engineers' gondolas for use by maintenance staff.[citation needed]
