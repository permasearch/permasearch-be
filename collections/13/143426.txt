He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 2,261.[117] He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season.[118] In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown.[119] The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher's previous record, which was set almost a year earlier.[120] Additionally, Hester set a Super Bowl record by becoming the first player to return an opening kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown.[121] On December 20, 2010, Hester set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers.
