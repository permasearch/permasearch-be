At 75-80°C, Taq reaches its optimal polymerization rate of about 150 nucleotides per second per enzyme molecule, and any deviations from the optimal temperature range inhibit the extension rate of the enzyme. A single Taq synthesizes about 60 nucleotides per second at 70°C, 24 nucleotides/sec at 55°C, 1.5 nucleotides/sec at 37°C, and 0.25 nucleotides/sec at 22°C. At temperatures above 90°C, Taq demonstrates very little or no activity at all, but the enzyme itself does not denature and remains intact.[5] Presence of certain ions in the reaction vessel also affects specific activity of the enzyme. Small amounts of potassium chloride (KCl) and magnesium ion (Mg2+) promote Taq's enzymatic activity. Taq polymerase is maximally activated at 50mM KCl and just the right concentration of Mg2+ which is determined by the concentration of nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). High concentrations of KCl and Mg2+ inhibit Taq's activity.[6]
