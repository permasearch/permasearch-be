Monazite was the only significant source of commercial lanthanides, but concern over the disposal of the radioactive daughter products of thorium, bastn√§site came to displace monazite in the production of lanthanides in the 1960s due to its much lower thorium content. Any future increase in interest in thorium for nuclear energy will bring monazite back into commercial use.
