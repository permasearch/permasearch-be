A new advertising campaign launched in Spring 2000 which "dramatises the extraordinary appeal of Irn-Bru in a likeably maverick style"[29] Emma Jardine, Account Director, says: "The ads will more than live up to people's expectations of Irn-Bru's continuously humorous campaign." while David Amers, Planning Director, says: "Irn-Bru is the likeable maverick of the soft drinks market and these ads perfectly capture the brand's spirit." One involved a grandfather (played by actor Robert Wilson) who removed his false teeth to spoil his grandson's interest in his can of Irn-Bru. A further TV advertisement featured a senior citizen in a motorised wheelchair robbing a local shopping market of a supply of Irn-Bru.
