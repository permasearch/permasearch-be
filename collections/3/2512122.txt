Lucy is getting more and more desperate for a baby, but instead of waiting for a relationship she decides to look for a sperm donor and become a single mother. Her original choice is a colleague (Timothy Knightley) - but after she worries about not knowing him well enough, Lee is the only one that she has to offer. Lee feels uncomfortable about the offer but does not want to upset Lucy, so accepts it on the condition that her parents and his father agree - Lucy eventually persuades them all. Lee turns up at the hospital in a nervous state ready for his donor, but when he puts the DVD on, he keeps imagining faces of people he knows speaking to him as the performer on the video, which puts him under more pressure. He then anxiously gives up and lies to Lucy that he has a problem and is unable to do the donation. Then it leaves Lee and Lucy with no choice but to have intercourse, but Lee ejaculates prematurely. Lucy ultimately accepts that it is not time yet, and she will wait until she is in a relationship.
