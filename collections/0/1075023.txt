In an effort to standardize and make it easier to process passports, several countries have implemented RFID in passports, despite security and privacy issues.[94] The encryption on UK chips was broken in under 48 hours.[95] Since that incident, further efforts have allowed researchers to clone passport data while the passport is being mailed to its owner. Where a criminal used to need to secretly open and then reseal the envelope, now it can be done without detection, adding some degree of insecurity to the passport system.[96]
