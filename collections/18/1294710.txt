The Army Combat Uniform (ACU) currently features a digital Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) and is designed for use in woodland, desert and urban environments. However, soldiers operating in Afghanistan and trainees in Basic Combat Training (as of 2017),[124] are being issued a fire-resistant ACU with the "MultiCam" pattern, officially known as Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern or "OCP".[125]
