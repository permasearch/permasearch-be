Beaver is grounded for leaving the cap off the ink bottle, causing Ward to spill ink all over his papers. After the rest of the Cleavers go out, Larry talks Beaver into sneaking off to the movies. A drawing is held at the movies and Beaver wins a bicycle. He can't take it home without betraying his disobedience to his father so Larry offers to take it home for a day. Mrs. Mondello calls Ward when she finds the bicycle and Larry discloses the truth. Later, Beaver realizes he cannot keep the bike and donates it to a church. Beaver thinks winning the bicycle was God's way of making children do everything they're told. Larry doesn't think that's right, because kids are told to do so much.
