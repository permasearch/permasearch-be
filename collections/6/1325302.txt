The terminology for "Germany", the "German states" and "Germans" is complicated by the unusual history of Germany over the last 2000 years.  This can cause confusion in German and English, as well in other languages.  While the notion of Germans and Germany is older, it is only since 1871 that there has been a nation-state of Germany.  Later political disagreements and the partition of Germany (1945â€“1990) has further made it difficult to use proper terminology.
