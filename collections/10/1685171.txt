Daimler’s Bus division launched its Mercedes-Benz inter-city luxury coaches in India in 2008. The initial entrance into India was achieved through DICV’s sister-concern, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd. However, with the establishment of DICV having become complete the obvious synergies in the area of Commercial Vehicles resulted in the transfer of Daimler Buses, India to DICV. The integration of Daimler Buses, India into DICV took place on 1 April 2013. In March 2014, DICV laid the foundation stone for its new bus plant at its Oragadam facility with an earmarked investment of 425 crores. The bus plant will design, develop and manufacture BharatBenz and Mercedes-Benz range of buses for the Indian market which is slated for launch in the second quarter of 2015.
