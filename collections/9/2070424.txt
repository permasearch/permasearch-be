Aspects of Raonic's game which have been criticized include his return of serve,[240][241] quickness and mobility,[242] backhand,[14] short game,[14] and the use of backspin or sidespin.[2] His above-average height—196 cm (6 ft 5 in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.[2][243]
