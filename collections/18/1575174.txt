If a fraudulent CNP transaction is reported, the acquiring bank hosting the merchant account that received the money from the fraudulent transaction must make restitution; whereas with a swiped (card present) transaction, the issuer of the card is liable for restitution.[1] Because of the greater risk, some card issuers charge a greater transaction fee to merchants who routinely handle card not present transactions.
