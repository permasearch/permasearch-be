Most counties in the antebellum South—as in the North—maintained a jail for housing pre-trial and pre-sentence detainees.[205] These varied in size and quality of construction considerably as a result of disparities in wealth between various counties.[206] Unlike Southern cities, however, rural counties rarely used the jail as criminal punishment in the antebellum period, even as states across the Northeast and the Midwest shifted the focus of their criminal justice process to rehabilitative incarceration.[207] Instead, fines were the mainstay of rural Southern justice.[208]
