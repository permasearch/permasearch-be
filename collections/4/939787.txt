On July 28, 2014, construction started for a streetcar line to stretch from downtown Detroit to Grand Boulevard in New Center. The line was to have 20 different stations serving 12 stops, with most of the stations curbside on either side of Woodward Avenue going uptown or downtown. The line will have center road stations at the north and south ends of the system.[97] Named QLine in 2016, the system opened in May 2017.[98] The last car of Detroit's previous streetcar system was numbered 286, so the planners numbered the cars for the new line 287â€“292 to pick up where the old number series had left off.[99]
