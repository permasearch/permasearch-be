In autumn 2011,[9] Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie,[11] the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very enthusiastic about the proposal. Just a few days after she finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall contact Kudos Film and Television, a production company.[9] Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham.[7] Broadchurch was green-lit by Fincham almost immediately[8] for airing in early 2013.[9]
