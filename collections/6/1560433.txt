In very high doses, aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood–brain barrier.[135] A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as antiperspirants and antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than 40 mg/day per kg of body mass.[136] The use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, however excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels.[citation needed] Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption,[137] and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues.[138] Aluminium increases estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory.[139] The estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as metalloestrogens.
