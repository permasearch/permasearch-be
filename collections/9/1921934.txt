Almost all of his former slaves continued to work for him, often for little or no money;[32][better source needed] whether this decision was voluntary or the result of few other options existing for former slaves in the Deep South is difficult to determine.[33]  These servants were with him upon his death. Although old and infirm, Stephens continued to work on his house and plantation. According to a former slave, a gate fell on Stephens while he and another black servant were repairing it, "and he was crippled and lamed up from that time on till he died." The veracity of this rumor is difficult to determine as the cited ex-slave was not present when this happened.[34]
