Julie, out of intense guilt, sent an anonymous bouquet of yellow roses to Daniel Gregg's funeral, and Collie traced them back to Julie, whom he begins dating under the nickname "Bud", which Daniel Gregg used to call him before he was killed. He also wins the trust of Helen, whilst calling himself "Collie". Both girls have no idea that the men they are growing close to are one and the same. Collie's first act of revenge was to try and kill Barry Cox by luring him out to the college playing field with the threat of revealing (false) photographs of Daniel Gregg's death to the authorities. Barry is shot by Wilson, but survives; however Wilson sees this as a boon, as Barry has been left half paralyzed and Wilson muses, "For a guy like Barry, life in a wheelchair might be worse than no life at all." Wilson then attempts to kill Helen, but she flees and falls two stories from her bathroom window, but she is unharmed. Wilson then confronts Julie and attempts to strangle her, but he is knocked out by Ray before she can be hurt. None of the four teens in the novel are killed, and Collie also survives.
