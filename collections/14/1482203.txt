On June 13, 2017, Rodman returned to North Korea on what was initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. "My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea," Rodman said.[126] He added that he hoped to accomplish "something that's pretty positive." During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage.[127][128] Rodman was not able to meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation's Minister of Sports and handed off several gifts for Kim Jong Un, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump's 1987 book, The Art of the Deal.[129] Other gifts believed to be intended for the leader's daughter, included a Where's Waldo? book and a jigsaw puzzle of a mermaid.
