A static bottleneck is where no random or unexpected fluctuations occur which would happen during either a changeover or a breakdown of the system. A static system does not change in behavior and hence the system stays constant. Finding a bottleneck in a static system is very simple, it is simply the machine or process with the longest constant cycle time. Static systems do not exist in reality as no matter what, there will always be a slight fluctuation in cycle time. This is because there is no way to prevent any fluctuation from occurring to slow the system down. An example of this could be a power shortage or a natural disaster.[23] The behavior of any system is liable to any random event and hence all systems are dynamic. Dynamic systems can be divided into two main groups: Stable and unstable. The significant difference in the context of dynamic systems, is that the bottlenecks can shift. The speed of which a bottleneck shifts depending on the buffer between the processes.[23] Bottlenecks shift when its location of work center in the production area changes, and this leads to control problems due to the significant delay in output. Shifting bottlenecks are a result of inevitable unexpected events for which no planning is possible.[24]
