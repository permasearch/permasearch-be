Pusser vowed to bring all involved with his wife's death to justice. He identified four assassins: Louise Hathcock's former boyfriend Carl Douglas "Towhead" White, George McGann, Gary McDaniel, and Kirksey Nix; but he later changed his story when he could not identify them from pictures and in person. White was gunned down in front of the El Ray Motel on U.S. Highway 45 in Corinth, Mississippi on April 4, 1969; the alleged triggerman was a small-time hood named Berry Smith.
