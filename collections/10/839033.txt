When he goes missing, Eric sends Sookie Stackhouse and Hugo to the Dallas area to look for him. It is discovered that he is being held prisoner by the Fellowship of the Sun for a ritual execution. While infiltrating the Fellowship, Sookie is captured and attacked by one of their members, Gabe. As Gabe is attempting to rape Sookie, Godric appears and rescues her by breaking Gabe's neck. Conflict at the Fellowship comes to a head with a standoff between the Fellowship members and a vampire force led by Stan (one of Godric's lieutenants). Godric is able to defuse the incident without bloodshed. However, the Fellowship retaliates by sending a suicide bomber to his home, destroying three vampires and killing two human companions.
