CB radio was first introduced into the United Kingdom around 1972. Early use was known around the airports in the UK, particularly Stansted in 1973. As citizens band radio has been advertised in the US since before 1962,[3] it is possible that a number of these radios were brought into the UK and used illegally.[4] In the period 1976–1978, CB radio in Britain was much popularised by novelty hit songs[5] and its use in the film Convoy and the usage of illegal CB radio peaked in 1980. Companies in Britain sold US equipment quite openly, and equipment was readily available in car accessory shops. During this time, a great many CB clubs emerged in the UK and they became centres of protest in the march towards legalisation, in the hope that existing equipment could be used legally. In response to this, the government commissioned a white paper proposing a CB service called "Open Channel" around 860 MHz.
