There are three versions of the Rocko's Modern Life theme song. The first and original version can be heard playing throughout the first two-season one episodes to be produced. The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was used during most episodes of Season 1. Version 1 had high pitched, distorted voices in the chorus. The third version of the theme song was performed by Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider from The B-52's. They performed the Rocko's Modern Life theme song from Season 2, Season 3 and Season 4 onwards.
