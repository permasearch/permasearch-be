The Cody Firearms Museum houses the most comprehensive collection of American firearms in the world.[5] The collection includes firearms ranging from a 16th-century hand cannon to guns of modern manufacture. It holds weapons from almost every significant gun manufacturer in the world. The Winchester Collection, the heart of this museum, was transported from New Haven, Connecticut to Cody in 1976. Dedicated in 1991, the Cody Firearms Museum provides a permanent home for the Winchester collection, as well as the largest collection of DuBiel Arms Company rifles in the United States.[5] Visitors learn about topics in firearms manufacturing, including factory workers, business competition, and innovations in production. Within the exhibits, visitors are able to trace the evolution of modern firearms technology from its earliest days through today's variations. Membership to the Cody Firearms Museum allows access to the Cody Firearms Museum Records Service, which provides information from original factory records of the Winchester, Marlin, or L.C. Smith companies based on the make and serial number of the firearm.
