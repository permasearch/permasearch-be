On August 17, 2016, Trump announced Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen Bannon as the campaign chief executive and promoted Conway to campaign manager, replacing Paul Manafort who had been handling those duties unofficially. Manafort had been criticized in the media for connections to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich[252] and other dictators.[253] Although Manafort initially retained the title of campaign chairman,[254][255] he resigned from this position on August 19, 2016.[256][257]
