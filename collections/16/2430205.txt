RuPaul is noted among drag queens for his indifference toward the gender-specific pronouns used to address himâ€”both "he" and "she" have been deemed acceptable, as stated in his autobiography: "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me."[1] RuPaul has also played men in a number of roles, and makes public appearances both in and out of drag.
