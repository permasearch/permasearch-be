The intention of the founders of the group was to explore the idea of developing aquafaba in a collaborative public manner, loosely borrowing ideas from the open source software world and applying them to the experimental food community. The hope was that by encouraging proper attribution outside the group and unrestricted contribution from members within the group, a natural nurturing atmosphere for trial and error where failures are deemed as important as successes and new discoveries would emerge, encouraging others to share openly. The premise was that new discoveries could be used openly in books, blogs, bakeries, and retail, while retaining some protection against larger forces in food manufacturing and industry restricting that development.[26][29]
