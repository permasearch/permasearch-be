Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security."[16] He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, and religion.[16]  Moore maintains that there are at least three other problems with the "nothing to hide" argument.  First, if individuals have privacy rights, then invoking "nothing to hide" is irrelevant.  Privacy, understood as a right to control access to and uses of spaces, locations, and personal information, means that it is the right holder who determines access.  To drive this point home Moore offers the following case.  "Imagine upon exiting your house one day you find a person searching through your trash painstakingly putting the shredded notes and documents back together.  In response to your stunned silence he proclaims 'you don’t have anything to worry about – there is no reason to hide, is there?'" [16] Second, individuals may wish to hide embarrassing behavior or conduct not accepted by the dominant culture.  "Consider someone’s sexual or medical history. Imagine someone visiting a library to learn about alternative lifestyles not accepted by the majority." [16] Finally, Moore argues that "nothing to hide," if taken seriously, could be used against government agents, politicians, and CEO's.  This is to turn the “nothing to hide” argument on its head.  Moore argues that the NSA agent, politician, police chief, and CEO have nothing to hide so they should embrace total transparency like the rest of us.  "But they don’t and when given the technological tools to watch, the politician, police chief, or CEO are almost always convinced that watching others is a good thing." [16]
