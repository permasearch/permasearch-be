An early draft of the screenplay was written by Chris Conkling,[3] who told the bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view.[10] After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle was called in for a rewrite.[3][10] According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.[11]
