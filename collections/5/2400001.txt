The state legislature convenes in regular session at noon each odd-numbered year on the first Monday in February.[9] However, in the odd-numbered years following an election, the state legislature must meet on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January for the sole purpose of determining the outcome of the statewide elections. The state constitution limits the state legislature to meeting 160 legislative days during each biennium.[10] In addition, the legislature may not meet in regular session after the last Friday in May of each year.[9]
