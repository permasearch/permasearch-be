Between 1600 and 1990, global reactive nitrogen (Nr) creation had increased nearly 50%.[5] During this period, atmospheric emissions of Nr species reportedly increased 250% and deposition to marine and terrestrial ecosystems increased over 200%.[5] Additionally, there was a reported fourfold increase in riverine dissolved inorganic N fluxes to coasts.[5] Nitrogen is a critical limiting nutrient in many systems, including forests, wetlands, and coastal and marine ecosystems; therefore, this change in emissions and distribution of Nr has resulted in substantial consequences for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.[6][7]
