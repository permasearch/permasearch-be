Bethany (now played by Lucy Fallon) returns to Weatherfield in March 2015, without Sarah's permission.[4] A furious Sarah soon follows to take her back to Milan but Bethany refuses to leave and eventually, after losing her job, Sarah announces that they are moving back to Weatherfield. Sarah begins a relationship with Callum Logan (Sean Ward), a drug dealer who is in the middle of a custody battle with David over his son and David's stepson Max Turner (Harry McDermott). In August 2015, Sarah breaks up with Callum when she learns of his true colours following a gun being found in Max's bedroom. She tells the police about the gun but he isn't charged; Callum swears revenge on the Platt family. Callum later tells David and his wife and Max's mother Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) that in exchange for Â£20,000 he will be out of their lives forever. In September 2015, Callum turns up at the Platt house where he takes Sarah hostage and when she tries to escape he attacks and attempts to rape her but is stopped when Kylie arrives and hits him over the head, killing him. Sarah is left in shock and is forced to help cover up his murder.
