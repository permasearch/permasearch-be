Verwoerd went to a Lutheran primary school in Wynberg, a suburb of Cape Town.[4] By the end of 1912 the Verwoerd family moved to Bulawayo, in what was then Rhodesia, where his father became an assistant evangelist in the Dutch Reformed Church. Hendrik Verwoerd attended Milton High School where he was awarded the Beit Scholarship, established through the generosity of the diamond magnate and financier Alfred Beit. Verwoerd received the top marks for English literature in the whole of Rhodesia.[5]
