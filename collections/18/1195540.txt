This all-suite complex consists of four low-rise buildings, lettered A-D. It is classified as an autonomous community, but is considered part of Hedrick Court for practical purposes. Front desk and mailroom services, as well as recreation rooms are in the ground floor of Hedrick Hall. The closest dining options are located in Rieber Court. After a one-year renovation, Hitch was reopened for the 2014-2015 academic year. You will primarily find 1st and 2nd year students in this complex along with 1st year transfers.
