Some police services in Canada such as the Calgary Police Service have trialed body-worn video systems since 2012, and have recently adopted body-cameras for deployment by all officers beginning in 2017.[8] Police unions in Canada have been opposed to body-worn video systems, citing privacy and cost concerns.[9] In 2015, several city police units including those in Winnipeg and Montreal announced plans to experiment with the technology.[8] The Toronto Police Service started a pilot in 2014 with the technology during a year-long study of body-worn cameras. In total, 100 officers were using the technology from May 2015 thru May 2016.[10] The evaluation report concluded that support for the body cameras was strong and increased during the pilot. There were technical issues, for instance with battery life, camera mounting, docking, recharging, ability to classify, ease of review and other issues. Administrative responsibilities associated with the body cameras resulted in significant commitment of time by officers that then was not available to spend on other duties.[11] In September 2016, the Toronto police wanted to put out a call for proposals from suppliers.[12]
