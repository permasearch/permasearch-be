Scouting is the largest co-educational youth movement in the UK.[423] Scouting began in 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell, Lieutenant General in the British Army, held the first Scout camp at Brownsea Island in Dorset, England.[424] Baden-Powell wrote the principles of Scouting in Scouting for Boys in 1908.[425] In July 2009, adventurer Bear Grylls became the youngest Chief Scout ever, aged 35. In 2010, scouting in the UK experienced its biggest growth since 1972, taking total membership to almost 500,000.[423]
