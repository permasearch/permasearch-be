The iPhone 5S maintains a similar design to the iPhone 5, with a 4 in (10 cm) LCD multi-touch Retina display and a screen resolution of 640×1136 at 326 ppi.[38] Its home button has been updated with a new flat design using a laser-cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring; the button is no longer concave, nor does it contain the familiar squircle icon seen on previous models.[39] The phone itself is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick and weighs 112 grams (4.0 oz).[40] The phone uses an aluminum composite frame.[41] The device is available in three color finishes; "space-gray" (replacing black with slate trim on the iPhone 5), white with silver trim, and white with gold trim.[42][43] The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to be available in gold color; this decision was influenced by the fact that gold is seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.[44]
