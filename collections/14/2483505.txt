O'Keefe started her career as a model at the age of 8 years old, and she did some modeling work for a Jeans company. Midway through her junior year of high school, O'Keefe left school to star on the soap opera Another World, playing Marguerite “Maggie” Cory. She then got a role on Nash Bridges playing Cassidy, the daughter of Don Johnson’s title character.[4] She and her mother moved to Hollywood so O'Keefe completed her schooling by mail.
