In 2014, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo's Nile Hippopotamus "Blackie", was euthanized at approximately 60 years of age.[44] Blackie may have been the longest-lived male Nile hippopotamus ever recorded in human care in North America. As far as hippos go, he had a gentle demeanor and weighed approximately 3700 lbs.[44]
