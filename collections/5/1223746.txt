There is a lack of schools in Haiti - insufficient schools given the number of potential students.[45]:17 One of the results of this is that it can be a long walk to school in the countryside, in the dark - a walk one way of 2 hours is not uncommon.[45]:17Parents can be reluctant to send a 6 year old that far on their own or even an older girl - there are safety concerns.[45]:19If the child does walk a long distance, they are often too tired to pay attention and may even fall asleep in class.[45]:18 The time getting to and from school also cuts into the time to help the family at home. If the parents are relying on the childâ€™s labor, this long walk can be a disincentive to enrollment.[45]:19 Delaying school enrollment leads to students starting school overaged which in turn has its own issues.
