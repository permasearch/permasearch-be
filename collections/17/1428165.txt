Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia,[9] critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.[49] In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself before the age of 19.[50] The onset of the disease is usually later in women than in men.[51] To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30Â months before the onset of symptoms.[49] Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms[52] and the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, dysphoria,[53] and clumsiness before the onset of the disease.[54] Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as walking slowly), isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.[55][56][57]
