In the season premiere "The Day Will Come When You Won't Be", Abraham is revealed to be the one picked by Negan to die. As he gives Sasha the peace sign Negan smacks his head with Lucille. As Abraham sits back up he defiantly tells Negan to "suck my nuts", and Negan bludgeons his head repeatedly until completely smashed in. After Daryl angrily punches Negan in retaliation he then kills Glenn in the same manner. After Negan and the Saviors leave Abraham and Glenn's corpses are loaded onto a truck Maggie and Sasha take to Hilltop. Rick then hallucinates an idealistic lifestyle in Alexandria with everyone, Abraham and Glenn included, eating dinner together. In "Go Getters", Abraham and Glenn are shown to be buried together at Hilltop.
