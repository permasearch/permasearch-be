The name "Log Kya Kahenge" (What will People Think) stems from a common Indian yardstick and social stigma against women who may challenge social norms of marriage and other expected forms of behaviour, a "stress-inducing" expectation surrounding women and arranged marriages.[5][6][7][8] One author said "In our sheltered Indian middle class homes, for every woman there is an unconsciously used Indian yardstick called, 'log kya kahenge'."[9]
