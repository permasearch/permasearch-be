After the 2011–12 season, Modrić joined Real Madrid for a £30 million transfer fee, where he became a key contributor under head coach Carlo Ancelotti and helped the team win La Décima during 2013–14 season, being elected to the squad of the season. After Zinedine Zidane took over Madrid, Modrić was critical to three consecutive Champions League titles from 2015–16 to 2017–18, each time being voted into the squad of the season. He would go on to win the La Liga Award for "Best Midfielder" in 2016 for the second time, UEFA Club Football Award for "Best Midfielder" in 2017 and 2018, and UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award and The Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018. In 2015, he became the first Croatian player ever to be included in the FIFA World XI, in which he was included once again between 2016 and 2018, as well in the UEFA Team of the Year in 2016 and 2017.
