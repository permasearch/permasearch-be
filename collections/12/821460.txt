Within a performance improvement framework, needs assessments play a critical role in starting the improvement process (see Figure A). Assessments inform future decisions; at the same time, they are informed by the results of past decisions. Needs assessments thereby link together past and future performance, guiding decisions throughout the improvement effort.[8]
