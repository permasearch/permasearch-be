Iggy is 14 years old, six months younger than Max (15 in the last three books), and third-in-command of the Flock. He is usually sarcastic, 6'0", has extremely pale skin, whitish-strawberry blonde hair, very light icy blue eyes, and a wingspan of 14 feet. Iggy is described as very handsome, especially because of his "unseeing, yet captivating, eyes". He is one of the only two flock members to have met his parents, the other being Max. His real name is revealed to be James Griffiths. When he found his parents, he learned that he was kidnapped by the School when he was about 4 months old. At first, Iggy decides to leave the Flock to live with his parents, but later leaves when he learns that his parents didn't want to have him back and only wanted to use him to make money off his story. Due to the whitecoats' experiments to enhance his night vision, Iggy is effectively blind, though he can see if his surroundings are white and can identify people by feeling their fingerprints and the feel of their wings. He can also feel colors. Despite his blindness, the Flock often leave things up to him that require precision or detail, such as cooking and doctoring. His senses are also the best of the flock due to his blindness, although he occasionally suffers resentment of his blindness and the resulting dependency of the Flock it creates. He and The Gasman are best friends and have a habit of building bombs out of almost anything and blowing things up, including alarm clocks. Iggy and Ella, Max's half sister, also showed signs of growing affection towards one another in Angel, which ultimately culminated in a shared kiss in Nevermore.
