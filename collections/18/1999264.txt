In the second half, United went ahead for the first time in the game, when a cross-shot from Neil Webb found its way to Mark Hughes who fired low into the corner. Palace manager, Steve Coppell made a game-changing substitution when he brought on Ian Wright, who had an immediate impact when he went on a mazy run past two United defenders and slotted a calm shot past Leighton. 2â€“2. Extra time loomed but not before Mike Phelan saw his clever chip hit the crossbar.
