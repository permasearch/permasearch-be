For Gladden, the "Christian law covers every relation of life" including the relationship between employers and their employees.[13] His 1877 book The Christian Way: Whither It Leads and How to Go On was his first national call for such a universal application of Christian values in everyday life. The book began his leadership in the Social Gospel movement.[14] Historians consider Gladden to be one of the Social Gospel movement's "founding fathers".[15]
