The additional insight is that the receiver does not need to distinguish between sequence numbers that are too low (less than nr) or that are too high (greater than or equal to ns+wr). In either case, the receiver ignores the packet except to retransmit an acknowledgment. Thus, it is only necessary that N ≥ wt+wr. As it is common to have wr<wt (e.g. see Go-Back-N below), this can permit larger wt within a fixed N.
