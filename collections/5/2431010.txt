In 1954, the 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company was set up in the school by Mr. Khoo Oon Soo and Mr. R.A. Allen. After the first few years, 1st KL shifted to the Wesley Church just next door to the school, and used the Church premises as its meeting place. The 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company is the 3rd oldest company in Malaysia, and is known for its history in Band, Footdrill and Talent Time competition results at National Level. The Company has also produced a fine collection of President's Men and Founder's Men, as well as two Queen's Men.
