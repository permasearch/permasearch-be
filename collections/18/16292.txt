Both houses of the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint committee is allowed to be established to agree on the matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess.[37] However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet.[37] Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.[6]
