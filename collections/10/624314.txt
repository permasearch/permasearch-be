Feige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, "hopefully it helps bend peopleâ€™s minds even more than with just the flat screen."[161] He said that "there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.[162] Over one hour of footage in the film was "specially formatted" for IMAX.[163]
