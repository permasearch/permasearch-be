Hudson River School landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (1830â€“1902) was born in Germany, and, though his family moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, when he was two, he spent many of his formative years in Europe.[1] He made his debut in an 1858 exhibition, but his breakthrough came in the aftermath of a journey he made the following year. In the spring of 1859, Bierstadt joined the Honey Road Survey Party led by then-colonel Frederick W. Lander.[2] He traveled as far as the Wind River Range in the Rocky Mountains, and made studies for numerous paintings along the way.[3] Bierstadt was greatly impressed by the landscape he encountered, and described the Rocky Mountains as "the best material for the artist in the world."[4] He had a habit of doing extensive preparation for his work, on occasion making as many as fifty sketches for a single painting.[5] In 1860, he exhibited Base of the Rocky Mountains, Laramie Peak at the National Academy of Design.[1] His greatest success, however, came with The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak, which he exhibited in 1863 at the Tenth Street Studio Building, where he also had a studio.[6]
