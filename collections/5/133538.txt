In 2007 the animated series debuted on American cable television on the Spike TV channel. (Denison, 2010)[who?] The series was produced for American viewers which “embodies the trend... comparing hip-hop artists to samurai warriors, an image some rappers claim for themselves". (Solomon, 2009)[who?] The storyline keeps in tone with the perception of a samurais finding vengeance against someone who has wronged him. Starring the voice of well known American actor Samuel L.

(King 2008)[who?] Due to its popularity, Afro Samurai was adopted into a full feature animated film and also became titles on gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox.
