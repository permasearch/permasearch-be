People diagnosed with DID often report that they have experienced severe physical and sexual abuse, especially during early to mid-childhood[32] (although the accuracy of these reports has been disputed[16]), and others report an early loss, serious medical illness or other traumatic event.[18] They also report more historical psychological trauma than those diagnosed with any other mental illness.[33] Severe sexual, physical, or psychological trauma in childhood has been proposed as an explanation for its development; awareness, memories and emotions of harmful actions or events caused by the trauma are removed from consciousness, and alternate personalities or subpersonalities form with differing memories, emotions and behavior.[34] DID is attributed to extremes of stress or disorders of attachment. What may be expressed as post-traumatic stress disorder in adults may become DID when occurring in children, possibly due to their greater use of imagination as a form of coping.[14][19] Possibly due to developmental changes and a more coherent sense of self past the age of six, the experience of extreme trauma may result in different, though also complex, dissociative symptoms and identity disturbances.[19] A specific relationship between childhood abuse, disorganized attachment, and lack of social support are thought to be a necessary component of DID.[14] Other suggested explanations include insufficient childhood nurturing combined with the innate ability of children in general to dissociate memories or experiences from consciousness.[18]
