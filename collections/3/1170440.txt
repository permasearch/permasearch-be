The contrast in the photos of Martin and of Zimmerman which were most widely used in early media reports of the shooting may have influenced initial public perceptions of the case.[330][331] The most commonly published image of Martin, provided to media by his family,[332] showed a smiling baby-faced teen.[330][Note 12] The only image of Zimmerman initially available to news media was a 7-year-old police booking photograph released by law enforcement officials after the shooting.[331] The image showed a heavy-set Zimmerman who appeared to be unhappy or angry,[331] with an imposing stare.[330] The AP quoted academic Kenny Irby on the expected effect, "When you have such a lopsided visual comparison, it just stands to reason that people would rush to judgment," and another academic, Betsi Grabe, as saying that journalists will present stories as a struggle between good and evil "[i]f the ingredients are there."[330]
