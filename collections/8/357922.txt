The "unofficial"[according to whom?] Ninth Doctor from the 40th anniversary animated webcast Scream of the Shalka (2003) has a TARDIS console room that looked similar to the Eighth Doctor's version. This console was covered in an array of clock-like dials, featured a long spiral staircase leading far above the console, and connected to a nearby room resembling a Victorian library and study. Due to the freedom afforded by the medium of animation, this TARDIS is the first and only to feature an interior with no walls.[clarification needed][disputed â€“ discuss]
