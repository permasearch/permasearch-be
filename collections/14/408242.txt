One of Burnet's first acts as president was to transfer the capital of the new state from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Harrisburg, which was located nearer the small Texas Navy at Galveston Island. Harrisburg was also closer to the border with the United States and would allow easier communication with U.S. officials. The move took on a sense of urgency when the convention received word that Santa Anna was within 60 miles (100Â km) of Washington-on-the-Brazos. Burnet quickly adjourned the proceedings and the government fled.[17] Burnet personally carried the Texas Declaration of Independence in his saddlebags.[32]
