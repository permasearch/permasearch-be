Back-siphonage occurs when higher pressure fluids, gases, or suspended solids move to an area of lower pressure fluids. For example, when a drinking straw is used to consume a beverage, suction reduces the pressure of fluid inside the straw, causing liquid to move from the cup to inside the straw and then into the drinker's mouth. A significant drop of pressure in a water delivery system creates a similar suction, pulling possibly undesirable material into the system.  This is an example of an indirect cross-connection.
