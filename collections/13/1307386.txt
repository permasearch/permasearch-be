The battle is reenacted in the AMC television series, Turn: Washington's Spies. In the second-season finale, a highly dramatized account of the battle is given, wherein General Lee has become a traitor due to envy of Washington's position as head of the Continental Army. He conspires with the British to lead the Continentals into a trap. Washington arrives early, relieves Lee of command and quickly recovers the battle in favor of the Americans.[24]
