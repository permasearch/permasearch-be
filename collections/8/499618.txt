Madame Tussauds (UK: /tjuːˈsɔːdz/, US: /tuːˈsoʊz/; the family themselves pronounce it /ˈtuːsoʊ/[1]) is a wax museum in London with smaller museums in a number of other major cities. It was founded by wax sculptor Marie Tussaud. It used to be known as "Madame Tussaud's"; the apostrophe is no longer used.[2][3] Madame Tussauds is a major tourist attraction in London, displaying the waxworks of famous and historic people and also popular film characters. The first Madame Tussauds in India opened in Delhi in December 2017 with its operator Merlin Entertainments foraying into India with an investment plan of 50 million pounds over the next 10 years.[4]
