As a young girl, she believed in Arthur's dreams of becoming a king, and upon returning with Excalibur she became his wife. Unfortunately, she would become neglected by Arthur's obsession with Excalibur, resulting in her falling for Lancelot. The two even went on a mission to seek out the Dark One's dagger. Thanks to a deal made by Rumplestiltskin, she traded the gauntlet in exchange for the magical sands that came from the sap of a tree that is found on Avalon. When Arthur finds out about her feelings for Lancelot, he takes the sands and uses it on Guinevere to make her follow his orders and then they both use it to fix Camelot and make it into a castle. She then uses the sand on David and Mary Margaret so they can follow Arthur's orders but they are later free from it thanks to Merlin. Guinevere later watches in horror when the Dark Curse consumes all of Camelot and takes them to Storybrooke.
