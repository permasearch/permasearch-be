The 14 finalists moved into the model home before meeting host Georgina Wilson and Joey Mead-King for an evaluation of their runway walks. They later had a turntable runway challenge under the watchful eye of model agent Marina Fairfax, where Barbara was chosen as the winner. For the photo shoot, the models were photographed amidst a jungle setting wearing high-end swimwear. At elimination, Celine and Shareeta landed in the bottom two, and Shareeta became the first contestant to be sent home.
