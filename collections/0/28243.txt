Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.[5] GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman.[6] Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy.[1][7] GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece.[6] Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian,[8] Trisquel[9] and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[10]
