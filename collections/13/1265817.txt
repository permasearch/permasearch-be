Reviews of the individual chapters were also mixed. Although appreciative of Brian Blessed's acting, Cornell, Day and Topping argued that the script for Mindwarp lacked focus, "[trying] to be comic, grotesque, straight, and farcical all at the same time".[23] Howe and Walker were more favourable towards the script, citing Sil's re-appearance as positive, and hailing Peri's death as "one of the most dramatic and impressive moments of the entire season" and Bryant's best scene since The Caves of Androzani.[24] Both reviews judged Terror of the Vervoids to be a well-written story, although Cornell, Day and Topping criticised the dialogue, and Howe and Walker were unimpressed by Bonnie Langford's performance.[21][22]
