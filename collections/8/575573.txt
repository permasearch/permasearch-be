The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser.[23] Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped[24] made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008.[25] Google subsequently made the comic available on Google Books[26] and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.[27] The product was allegedly named "Chrome" because Google wanted to minimize the chrome of the browser,[28] though this meaning was added somewhat post-hoc, the 'codename' before release apparently chosen from a connotation of speed.[29]
