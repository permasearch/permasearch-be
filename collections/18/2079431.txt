According to Nielsen Media Research, the six-game series on Fox averaged an 8.9 rating and 15 share. The 8.9 rating was, by a large margin, the lowest for a six-game World Series (the 2009 World Series that pulled an 11.7 was the prior lowest) and the fourth lowest overall, behind the 2010, 2008 and 2012 series (the latter holding the record low at 7.6). Game 3, which pulled a 7.4 rating, is the fourth lowest rated MLB World Series game, ahead of just Game 3 of the 2011 World Series (6.6), Game 3 of the 2012 World Series (6.1), and Game 3 of the 2008 World Series (6.1).[57]
