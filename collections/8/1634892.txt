In the 1980s, Günter Wächtershäuser, encouraged and supported by Karl R. Popper,[218][219][220] postulated his iron–sulfur world, a theory of the evolution of pre-biotic chemical pathways as the starting point in the evolution of life. It systematically traces today's biochemistry to primordial reactions which provide alternative pathways to the synthesis of organic building blocks from simple gaseous compounds.
