The word "curare" comes from the South American Indian name for the arrow poison, ourare. Presumably, the initial syllable was pronounced with a heavy glottal stop. Tubocurarine is so-called because the plant samples containing the curare were stored and shipped to Europe in tubes.[citation needed] Likewise, curare stored in calabash containers was called calabash curare.
