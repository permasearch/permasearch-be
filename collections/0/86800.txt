The song has been played at Fenway Park, home of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox, since at least 1997,[20] and in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002.[21] On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed by Diamond himself. "Sweet Caroline" was played at Penn State Nittany Lions football games at Beaver Stadium until August 2012, halting after the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.[22][23] Performances at Beaver Stadium resumed in September 2013, however.[24] The song is played at the start of the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh Panthers Football games at Heinz Field.[25] In response, West Virginia University students and fans will yell "eat shit, Pitt" during the refrain if heard played.[26] It is also an unofficial song of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, being played at athletic events and pep rallies.
