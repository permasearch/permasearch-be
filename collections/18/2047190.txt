In the fall of 2006, following Mascolo's exit from B&B due to lack of storyline, reports began to surface claiming that Mascolo was going to reprise his role as Stefano. The series' producers later confirmed plans to revive the DiMera family in order to stop a decline in ratings.[13] A deathly ill, comatose Stefano began appearing on December 19, 2006. Though some sources list Mascolo in the cast credits for the episodes, neither Mascolo nor NBC have ever stated that he portrayed comatose Stefano.[14] It was later confirmed that Mascolo would reappear in the role officially in 2007, along with costars Thaao Penghlis (Tony DiMera) and Leann Hunley (Anna DiMera).[15] Mascolo made his first official appearance as Stefano on June 6, 2007.[13] However the stint proved to be short-lived with Mascolo last appearing on February 29, 2008 and the character of Stefano was written out to allow the writers to come up with more story for him. In May 2008, the tabloid Globe confirmed that Mascolo had been fired and Stefano was written into another coma. This decision did not sit well with Mascolo who gave a heated interview to Soap Opera Digest accusing the executives of "double crossing" him.[16][17]
