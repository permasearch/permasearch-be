A Levels require studying an offered A level subject over a two-year period and sitting for an examination at the end of each year (A1/S and A2, respectively), proctored by an official assessment body. Most students study three or four A level subjects simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16â€“18) in a secondary school, in a sixth form college, in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their further education.
