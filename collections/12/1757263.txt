Each player has a choice at the beginning of their turn. They may either pick up one new card from the top of the deck or take the upcard. (Also, the other players in the game have the ability to get the up card.) After the player draws his card, either from the deck or the upcard, he must then choose any card in his hand to discard, and he then places this card face up on the discard pile. That card then becomes the new upcard, which the next player in turn can take or other players can buy. To get a card that isn't yours a player must say, â€œBUY", before the next player draws their card, or else it is already considered "dead". Once a player discards their card the card underneath that card is now considered a "dead" card because it is no longer in the game. Players may not take these cards.
