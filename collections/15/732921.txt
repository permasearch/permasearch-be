As of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine.[76] The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options.[76] The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India.[76] Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed.[76] This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India.
