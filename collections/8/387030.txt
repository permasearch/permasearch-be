In late May, The New York Times reported that some fans with allocated tickets had returned them after having trouble finding flights to and accommodation in Kiev. Locals in Kiev began offering free accommodation for fans affected by cancelled hotel and apartment arrangements.[34] Several charter flights arranged for Liverpool fans were cancelled, leaving fans with tickets stranded and leading to an unsuccessful search for alternative solutions by the club and city government.[35][36] Other airlines offered flights to Kiev from airports in Liverpool and Manchester, using assigned slots at Kiev's airports.[37]
