The Great Domesday Book[16][17] of 1086 did not use the later Wapentake district names in this part of England, as it usually did, but instead used the name Craven. The Book included lands further west than any later description: Melling, Wennington and Hornby[18] on the River Lune in Lonsdale and even Holker near Grange over Sands in Cumbria.
