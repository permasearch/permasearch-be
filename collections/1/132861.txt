Compared to its primary rival mobile operating system, Apple's iOS, Android updates typically reach various devices with significant delays. Except for devices within the Google Nexus brand, updates often arrive months after the release of the new version, or not at all.[131] This is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware in Android devices,[132] to which each upgrade must be specifically tailored, a time- and resource-consuming process.[133] Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind.[134] Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers that, after receiving updates from manufacturers, further customize and brand Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users.[134][135] There are also situations in which upgrades are not possible due to one manufacturing partner not providing necessary updates to drivers.[136]
