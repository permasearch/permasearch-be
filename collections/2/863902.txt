The satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD. Lucian's works were incredibly popular during antiquity. Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day.[136] Almost all of Lucian's works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time. His book The Syrian Goddess, however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus.[137][138] Lucian's most famous work is the novel A True Story, which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction.[139][140] His dialogue The Lover of Lies contains several of the earliest known ghost stories[141] as well as the earliest known version of "The Sorcerer's Apprentice."[142] His letter The Passing of Peregrinus, a ruthless satire against Christians, contains the earliest undisputed reference to Jesus Christ by a Greek author.[143]
