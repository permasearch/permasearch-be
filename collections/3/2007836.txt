The first Caribbean monk seal to live in captivity for an extended period was a female seal that lived in The New York Aquarium.[14] The seal was captured in 1897 and died in 1903, living in captivity for a total of five and one-half years.[14] In 1909 The New York Aquarium acquired four Caribbean monk seals, three of which were yearlings (between one and two years old), and the other a mature male.[15]
