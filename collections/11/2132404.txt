"Wake Up Dead" features lyrics which describe a man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him.[16] Mustaine said that "Wake up Dead" was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, he was in love with another girl and thought the one he lived with would be mad because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him.[17] "The Conjuring", according to author Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony,[18] and makes references about being the devil's advocate and his salesman.[19] Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes.[20] However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song has not been played live since 2001.[21]
