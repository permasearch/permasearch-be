During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. The Great Western Railway arrived in 1841,[24] followed by the South Eastern Railway in 1849 and the London and South Western Railway in 1856.[25][26] The Summer Assizes were moved from Abingdon to Reading in 1867, effectively making Reading the sole county town of Berkshire, a decision that was officially approved by the privy council in 1869.[22] The town became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888.[27][28] The town has been famous for the Three Bs of beer (1785–2010, Simonds Brewery),[29][30] bulbs (1837–1974, Suttons Seeds),[29][31] and biscuits (1822–1976, Huntley and Palmers).[29][32][33]
