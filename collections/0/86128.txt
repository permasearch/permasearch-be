Tatsumi (タツミ) is a swordsman who sets out to the capital city to raise money for his impoverished village. He has brown hair and green eyes.[5] Separated from his two companions, Tatsumi is swindled of his money, but is taken in by a girl with a wealthy upbringing.[ch. 1] When he tries to defend that girl from Night Raid, he soon discovers that the girl had actually tortured and killed his comrades, so he kills her and is recruited to join Night Raid,[ch. 1] He accepts, as their actions of fighting corruption would eventually help his village.[ch. 2] His primary weapon is a short sword, but he later inherits Bulat's Teigu "Demon Armor: Incursio" (悪鬼纏身 インクルシオ, Akki Tenshin: Inkurushio), which was created from the still living flesh of an adaptive dragon Danger Beast called Tyrant. While normally a short sword, Incuriso can form armor around the user and grant them powers such as invisibility and superhuman strength.[ch. 5,14] However, Tatsumi's continued use of Incursio takes a toll on his body, and his body and his humanity are consumed by Tyrant. In the manga, he transforms into Tyrant but retains his mind,[ch. 76-77] but in the anime he dies after defeating Shikoutazer.Ep. 24 In the manga, after the war, Tatsumi, trapped in his Tryrant form for life, returns to Mine's side, and they settle in his old village to raise the child they conceived before she fell into coma.[ch. 78]
