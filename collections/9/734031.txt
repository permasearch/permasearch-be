Sesame Street has a "News Flash" skit with Kermit the Frog where he interviews the Prince trying to charm Rapunzel with the famous line, however, she is having a hard time hearing him and when she finally understands him, she literally lets all her hair fall down (completely off her head), leaving the prince confused as to what to do now.
