The first movement is in a sonata form. It begins with a first theme material in a lengthy introduction by the orchestra. The theme develops and after a brief transition leads to the second theme material in measure 41. The second theme material dies away and the orchestra suddenly bursts in at m. 78 with the closing section. The solo violin enters at m. 90 with a strong statement in martelÃ© followed by a series of chords that bring on the long arpeggio section. After the long arpeggio section, the solo violin finally reaches the first theme in measure 136. The first theme is worked out with its beautiful melodies until it reaches the strong chords in measure 164. The chords again turn to the arpeggio section. The new second theme of the solo exposition is introduced in measure 206. The solo violin bursts in with the closing theme at m. 246. This leads to an intense section that finishes the exposition. The development section has a soulful melody that soon turns into a dreamy passage. After a sudden forte section, the solo violin enters with angular material. The recapitulation begins at measure 381. The coda begins at measure 527 following the cadenza.
