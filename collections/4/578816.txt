The proviso to section 217(1) exempts from the prohibition those peace officers who are also magistrates or justices of peace. Police officials of commissioned-officer rank (lieutenant and higher) are also justices of the peace, and therefore included in the exemption. In practice, therefore, the exclusion of confessions applies to constables, sergeants and warrant officers in the SAPS, as well as to certain categories of other officials referred to in definition of "peace officer." For ease of reference those officials affected by the disqualification will henceforth be called "disqualified officials."
