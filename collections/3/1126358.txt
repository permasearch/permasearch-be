Another cause of vitamin C being lost from food is leaching, where the water-soluble vitamin dissolves into the cooking water, which is later poured away and not consumed. However, vitamin C does not leach in all vegetables at the same rate; research shows broccoli seems to retain more than any other.[84] Research has also shown that freshly cut fruits do not lose significant nutrients when stored in the refrigerator for a few days.[85]
