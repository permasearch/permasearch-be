The 1965 Gillette Cup was the third Gillette Cup, an English limited overs county cricket tournament. It was held between 23 April and 4 September 1965.[1] The tournament was won by Yorkshire, following Geoff Boycott's 146 runs in the final at Lord's. Boycott's innings remained the highest ever scored in a Lord's county limited-overs final.[2] until 2017. [3]
