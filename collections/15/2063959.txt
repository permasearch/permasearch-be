The Encyclopædia Britannica's changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as "an elegant novelist" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as "one of the most distinguished modern British novelists".[77] Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel.[78] The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the Memoir and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in Harper's Magazine, that of "dear aunt Jane".[79] Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as "Austenolatry"[80]—it was only after the publication of the Memoir that readers developed a personal connection with Austen.[81] However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as Janeites to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.[82]
