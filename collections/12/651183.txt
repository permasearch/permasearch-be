In the United States, EMTs are certified according to their level of training. Individual states set their own standards of certification (or licensure, in some cases) and all EMT training must meet the minimum requirements as set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) standards for curriculum.[5] The National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is a private organization[6] which offers certification exams based on NHTSA education guidelines and has been around since the 1970s.[7][8] Currently, NREMT exams are used by 46 states as the sole basis for certification at one or more EMT certification levels.[9] A NREMT exam consists of skills and patient assessments as well as a written portion.
