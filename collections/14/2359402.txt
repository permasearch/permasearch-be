A division is also called a rising vote, where members stand up from their seats.[1] According to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), the numbers for and against are not counted in a division.[2] However, they may be counted by order of the chairman or by order of the assembly through majority vote.[3] The assembly may also have a rule that the division is counted.
