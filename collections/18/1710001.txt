Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data[31] and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments[32] to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous[33] and metamorphic processes. This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks.[34] This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth, such as subduction and magma chamber evolution.
