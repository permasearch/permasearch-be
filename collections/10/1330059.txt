Norfolk Island was originally a colony acquired by settlement but was never within the British Settlements Act.[81][82] It was accepted as a territory of Australia, separate from any state, by the Norfolk Island Act 1913 (Cth),[83] passed under the territories power (Constitution section 122) and made effective in 1914.[84] In 1976 the High Court of Australia held unanimously that Norfolk Island is a part of the Commonwealth.[85] Again, in 2007 the High Court of Australia affirmed the validity of legislation that made Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for voting for, and standing for election to, the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island.[86]
