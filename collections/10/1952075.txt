This is a list of Unicode characters. As of version 10.0, Unicode contains a repertoire of over 136,000 characters covering 139 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. As it is not technically possible to list all of these characters in a single Wikipedia page, this list is limited to a subset of the most important characters for English-language readers, with links to other pages which list the supplementary characters. This page includes the 1062 characters in the Multilingual European Character Set 2 (MES-2) subset, and some additional related characters.
