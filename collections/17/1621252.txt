Comstock became linked with the YMCA shortly after writing a financial request to Robert McBurney to continue with his efforts. Once the current President, Morris Jesup, became aware of the letter he immediately went to see Comstock and allocated the funds towards his efforts. On top of the money allocated for Comstock's efforts, Jesup also gave him a bonus for his efforts.
