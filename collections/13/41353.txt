The pulmonary artery pressure (PA pressure) is a measure of the blood pressure found in the main pulmonary artery. This is measured by inserting a catheter into the main pulmonary artery.[10] :190–191 The mean pressure is typically 9 - 18 mmHg,[11] and the wedge pressure measured in the left atrium may be 6-12mmHg. The wedge pressure may be elevated in left heart failure,[10]:190–191 mitral valve stenosis, and other conditions, such as sickle cell disease.[12]
