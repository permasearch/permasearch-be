Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size (in that it is big enough to carry an infant), and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).[128] The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud,[128] and Carl Jung.[150] In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister.[151] The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as nappies and birth announcements.[128]
