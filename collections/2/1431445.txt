Besides being one of the subjects of George Plimpton's nonfiction book Paper Lion (published in 1966), he was one of the two principal subjects of Plimpton's follow-up book, Mad Ducks and Bears (1973) (fellow Detroit Lion John Gordy was the "bear" to Karras' "mad duck.")  Karras named one of his sons after Plimpton.  During his last years as a Detroit Lion, Karras wrote a journal of his experiences that was published in the Detroit Free Press.  He subsequently wrote a memoir, Even Big Guys Cry (1978), and a novel, Tuesday Night Football (1991).
