In January 2013, the museum opened The US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center, which is the now largest building on the campus.[7] The collection in the US Freedom Pavilion includes a B-17E Flying Fortress bomber, a B-25J Mitchell bomber, an SBD-3 Dauntless, a TBF Avenger, a P-51C Mustang, Corsair F4U-4 and an interactive submarine experience based on the final mission of the USS Tang.[7] The B-17E is the airplane dubbed My Gal Sal, famous for having been lost over Greenland and recovered 53 years later.[7] The US Freedom Pavilion was paid for with a $15 million donation from the Boeing Company and with a $20 million grant from the US Department of Defense with Congressional approval.[8]
