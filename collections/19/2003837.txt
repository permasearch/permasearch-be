A restoration project began in 2004, with funding provided by American Express through World Monuments Fund.[4] Progress was slow until 2008, when a renewed restoration effort was made. A first phase of restoration was completed in April 2010, when the repair of the abutments allowed the bridge to be reopened for the public.[5] More recently, violence in the area has prevented the bridge from achieving the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[6]
