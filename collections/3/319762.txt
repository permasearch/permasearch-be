On 19 July 2010, the former dictator DÃ©si Bouterse returned to power when he was elected as the new President of Suriname.[25] He was reelected on 14 July 2015.[26] Before his election in 2010, he, along with 24 others, had been charged with the murders of 15 prominent dissidents in the December murders. However, in 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial, the National Assembly extended its amnesty law and provided Bouterse and the others with amnesty of these charges.
