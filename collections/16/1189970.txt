In September in Lynn, Massachusetts, a third-grader and Jehovah’s Witness named Carleton Nichols[3] refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and was expelled from school.[4] The Nichols incident received widespread media attention, and other Witness students soon followed suit. Rutherford gave a radio address praising Nichols,[5] and schools around the country began expelling Witness students and firing Witness teachers. Jehovah's Witnesses published the booklet Loyalty, making the matter an official doctrine of the faith before the end of 1935. Witnesses hired teachers and set up “Kingdom schools” to continue their children’s education.
