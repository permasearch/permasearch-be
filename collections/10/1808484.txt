After the war, Norden wrote material for comedian Dick Bentley, before meeting Frank Muir (who wrote for comic actor Jimmy Edwards) in 1947. Muir and Norden's first joint venture was a radio show for both performers, Take It From Here, which they scripted from 1948 to 1959. They went on to write many successful radio and television scripts, including Whack-O! (1956–60) and three series of Faces of Jim (1961–63) which were vehicles for Jimmy Edwards. They also wrote the satirical sketch Balham, Gateway to the South for the BBC Third Programme. The sketch, which had originally been broadcast in 1948 as part of a comedy series called The Third Division and which featured actor Robert Beatty, was later performed by Peter Sellers for his LP, The Best of Sellers (1959). In the early 1960s Muir and Norden wrote the sitcom Brothers in Law, an early series featuring Richard Briers, and its spin-off Mr Justice Duncannon.
