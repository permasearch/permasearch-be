Despite this, the characters' on/off romance was resurrected later in the year, facilitating a plot twist whereby Jack, angered after another break-up with Ronnie, was seduced by Roxy as revenge for Ronnie interfering in her love life. This resulted in a "who's the daddy?" storyline,[40] which began in April 2008 and continued throughout the year, with both Jack and Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) potential candidates for the father of Roxy's unborn child, though Ronnie remained unaware of Jack and Roxy's liaison. Rita Simons, who plays Roxy, said: "Jack winds Roxy up by suggesting that Ronnie controls her, so she decides to prove him wrong â€“ and kisses him. Afterwards it's really awkward between them. They can barely look at one another."[41] In the storyline, Roxy and Jack agreed to keep their affair secret, while Roxy appropriated Sean Slater as the father, and married him. [42]
