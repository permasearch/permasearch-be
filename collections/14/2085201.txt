Reverberatory furnaces (in this context, usually called air furnaces) were formerly also used for melting brass, bronze, and pig iron for foundry work. They were also, for the first 75 years of the 20th century, the dominant smelting furnace used in copper production, treating either roasted calcine or raw copper sulfide concentrate.[1] While they have been supplanted in this role, first by flash furnaces and more recently also by the Ausmelt[1] and ISASMELT furnaces,[2] as they are very effective at producing slags with low copper losses.[1]
