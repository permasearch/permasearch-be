Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy[143] that involves assisting trauma survivors to re-experience distressing trauma-related memories and reminders in order to facilitate habituation and successful emotional processing of the trauma memory. Most exposure therapy programs include both imaginal confrontation with the traumatic memories and real-life exposure to trauma reminders; this therapy modality is well supported by clinical evidence.[citation needed] The success of exposure-based therapies has raised the question of whether exposure is a necessary ingredient in the treatment of PTSD.[144] Some organizations[which?] have endorsed the need for exposure.[145][146] The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been actively training mental health treatment staff in prolonged exposure therapy[147] and Cognitive Processing Therapy[148] in an effort to better treat U.S. veterans with PTSD.
