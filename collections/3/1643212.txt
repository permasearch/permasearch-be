Since the opening of the university in 1875, only eight individuals have served as chancellors.[81] Landon Garland was the university's first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893.[81] Garland organized the university and hired its first faculty. Garland Hall, an academic building on campus, is named in his honor.[81]
