The word dowel was used in Middle English; it appears in Wycliffe's Bible translation (circa 1382-1395) in a list of the parts of a wheel: "...and the spokis, and dowlis of tho wheelis..."[10] Cognates with other Germanic languages suggest that the word is much older (deuvel in Dutch, DÃ¼bel in German).
