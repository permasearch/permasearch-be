The crocodile was named after Ernesto "Lolong" Goloran Cañete as one of the veteran crocodile hunters from the Palawan Crocodile and Wildlife Reservation Center, who led the hunt.[12] After weeks of stalking, the hunt for Lolong took its toll on Cañete's health. He died of a heart attack several days before the crocodile was captured.
