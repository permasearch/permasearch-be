One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla's patents, employed Tesla to develop them, and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.[26][33][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars,[27] but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891.[48][49][50]
