In short, if the accused foresaw the consequences or circumstances in question not as a probable result of his act, but considered that there was even a possibility[297] that they could result (and if he reconciled himself to this possibility), he will have had intention in the sense of dolus eventualis. On the other hand, if he did not actually foresee the possibility, but as a reasonable man ought to have foreseen it, he lacked intention; at most he was negligent.
