Born in 1874 in Savannah, Tennessee, Mary Elizabeth Patterson was the child of Mildred (née McDougal) and Edmund D. Patterson, a Confederate army veteran.[2] Federal census records document that her father by 1880 was a lawyer and residing with his wife and children in the home of his father-in-law, Garrick Archibald McDougal, a widower, who was also a lawyer and farmer in Savannah.[2] That same census lists Elizabeth as the second child of the Pattersons' four offspring. She had an older sister, Annie Belle, and two younger brothers, Edmund and Archie.[2] With regard to Elizabeth's education, it extended well beyond the local county schools. She also studied at Tennessee colleges in Pulaski and Columbia, where her participation in campus theater groups fostered a growing passion for drama.[3] Her parents soon sent her to Europe in hopes of diminishing her interest in theater; yet, Elizabeth's determination to become an actress was only reinforced during those travels, especially in Paris, where she attended productions of the Comédie Française.[3]
