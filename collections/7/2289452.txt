Called 'Multani Mitti' ('mud from Multan') in modern day India and Pakistan, the use of Fuller's Earth across the Indian subcontinent dates back to at least 1879[13]. While its household use and transportation by local carts in the Sindh region predates the 1800s, export by rail was first recorded in 1929 in British India.
