Under the direction of Tom Fazio, Quail Hollow underwent an aggressive 90-day renovation in 2016 that modified four holes and added Bermuda grass. It commenced during the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship on Sunday, May 8.[8][9] Thousands of trees were removed, as the former first two holes were combined into a new first hole, and the old fifth hole was divided between the new fourth and fifth holes.[9][10]
