In 2013, Lady Antebellum recognized 8 deserving military families for their service by inviting them to up close and personal concerts, and acknowledging them from the stage. Deserving members like Randy Burchett, who was a Viet Nam veteran who went on to serve at the Easter Seals for 33 years, playing Santa for disabled children.[38]
