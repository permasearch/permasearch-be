Both in composition and in publication, the poem had a checkered history. In its canonical form, it is composed of 419 lines of heroic couplets.[4] The Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot is notable as the source of the phrase "damn with faint praise," used so often it has become a clich√© or idiom. Another of its notable lines is "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?"
