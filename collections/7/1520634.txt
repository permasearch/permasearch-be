Sioux Indians burned a village of Nuptadi Mandans in the last quarter of the 18th century.[64] Other villages of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara destroyed either completely or partially in Indian attacks are two Hidatsa villages in 1834,[65] Mitutanka on January 9, 1839[66] and Like-a-Fishhook Village in 1862.[67] The three tribes would routinely ask the U.S. army for assistance against stronger Indian powers until the end of intertribal warfare in the area.[68]
