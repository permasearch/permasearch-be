During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of "Manchu and Han as one family" (滿漢一家).[156] People started exploring and debating with themselves on the root cause of their national weakness. This new search of identity was the New Culture Movement.[158] Manchu culture and language, on the contrary, has become virtually extinct by 2007.[159]
