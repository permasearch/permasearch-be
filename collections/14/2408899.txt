In 1882, two West London based youth teams formed, St Judes and Christchurch Rangers. Following a game between the sides in 1886, a merger was proposed. The team's name was suggested as the majority of players came from the district of Queen's Park.[1] Their first competitive match came on 1 November 1890, against Tottenham Hotspur in the London Senior Cup. They drew the game 1–1 at home, but lost 2–1 in the replay.[1] Other tournaments they took part in during these early years included the West London Challenge Cup and the West London Observer Cup. Rangers joined the West London League in 1892, and won their first trophy in the same year, the aforementioned West London Observer Cup. They defeated West London League Champions Fulham 3–2 in the final.[1] In 1895–96, QPR entered the FA Cup for the first time, but were knocked out of the competition by Old St Stephen's in the replay of their first matchup after drawing at home.[2]
