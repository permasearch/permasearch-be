In the United Kingdom, the "Barn Owl Nest Box Scheme" is promoted by the World Owl Trust[70] and has many participants in local areas such as Somerset, where a webcam has been set up inside a nest box in which seven young were reared in 2014.[71] Another barn owl nest box live-streaming webcam located in California, United States has proved popular online.[72] In May 2012, it was revealed that farmers in Israel and Jordan had, over a period of ten years, replaced pesticides with barn owls in a joint conservation venture called "Project Barn Owl".[73]
