Note that only the troposphere (up to approximately 12 kilometres (39,000Â ft) of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes convection: the stratosphere does not generally convect.[8] However, some exceptionally energetic convection processes -- notably volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops associated with severe supercell thunderstorms -- may locally and temporarily inject convection through the tropopause and into the stratosphere.
