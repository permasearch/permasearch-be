Matrix powers appear often in the context of discrete dynamical systems, where the matrix A expresses a transition from a state vector x of some system to the next state Ax of the system.[22]  This is the standard interpretation of a Markov chain, for example.  Then      A  2   x   {\displaystyle A^{2}x}   is the state of the system after two time steps, and so forth:      A  n   x   {\displaystyle A^{n}x}   is the state of the system after n time steps.  The matrix power      A  n     {\displaystyle A^{n}}   is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time n steps in the future.  So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the dynamical system.  In many cases, matrix powers can be expediently computed by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
