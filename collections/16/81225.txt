The Boy Scouts of America operates a National Camping School program, which trains people how to run various departments or areas at the Boy Scout summer camps. Some online training is offered, but most areas require an in-person week-long training program at one of the National Camping Schools.[89][90] After successfully completing a week-long program, a person is entitled to wear the National Camping School patch. The regular size patch may be worn on the right breast shirt pocket, in the temporary patch spot.[91] National Camping School certification is valid for five years.[92]
