Thirdly, Irish troops in the British Army appear to have been treated with particular harshness. They constituted just two per cent of the membership of the force, yet they were the recipients of eight per cent (271) of all death sentences imposed by its courts-martial.[28] Estimates on the number of executed ranging from 25 to 30 of the Irish war dead were victims of court martial executions.[29][30][31] Opposition to the war in Ireland may have therefore been influenced by perceived discrimination by British High Command against Irish soldiers. On average one British soldier out of every 3,000 of their troops that died in the war did so due to being court martialed and executed by firing squad, compared to the much higher one out of every 600 of the Irish troops that died.[29][32] Out of the total that were executed, 26 have since been retroactively pardoned.[33][34]
