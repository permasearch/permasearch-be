The enigmatic Lady Sylvia is in fact the immortal priestess to the ancient snake god, Dionin, which, as James correctly predicted, indeed survives, roaming the underground caves which connect Temple House with Stonerich Cavern. Lady Sylvia steals the skull and abducts Eve Trent, intending to offer her as the latest in a long line of sacrifices to her god. Before she can follow through with her evil actions, Angus, with the help of James, manages to rescue Eve and destroy both Sylvia and the worm. Angus however is bitten in the process by Sylvia, and finds himself cursed to carry on the vampiric, snake-like condition.
