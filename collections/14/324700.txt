Chick Hicks (voiced by Michael Keaton) serves as Lightning McQueen's primary rival in the first film. He is "a generic Pixar design, 'a stock 1980s American car'" according to Pixar publicity coordinator Amanda Sorena,[7] and strongly resembles a GM G-body with features from both the Chevrolet Monte Carlo and the Buick Grand National. As the real-life General Motors wanted nothing to do with the character by rejecting an initial Pixar proposal to cast a Chevrolet stock car as the movie's villain, Chick is effectively an orphan.[7] He has spent his entire career trailing Strip "The King" Weathers, and is bitter about this fact. His racing sponsor is Hostile Takeover Bank (HTB for short).
