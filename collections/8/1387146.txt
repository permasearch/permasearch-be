In the Kashmir region, approximately 300 Kashmiri Pandits were killed between September 1989 to 1990 in various incidents.[192] In early 1990, local Urdu newspapers Aftab and Al Safa called upon Kashmiris to wage jihad against India and ordered the expulsion of all Hindus choosing to remain in Kashmir.[192] In the following days masked men ran in the streets with AK-47 shooting to kill Hindus who would not leave.[192] Notices were placed on the houses of all Hindus, telling them to leave within 24 hours or die.[192]
