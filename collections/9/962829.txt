"CNR" is a style parody of the White Stripes, in particular borrowing heavily from "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground".[4][6] The song's lyrics are about superhuman feats that Charles Nelson Reilly could accomplish, similar to Chuck Norris facts. The song's end is also very similar to the chorus of the song "You Don't Mess Around with Jim." The video, created by JibJab, animates the song's lyrics using JibJab employees as actors against a green screen, interspersed with shots of Yankovic and Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz performing on a White Stripes-inspired red-and-white set, dressed as Jack White and Meg White, respectively.[6][7][8] In a first for any major recording artist, users of JibJab's web site had the option of including themselves in the music video.[9]
