In digs conducted in the 19th century, Conrad Schick discovered a large tank situated about 100 feet (30Â m) north-west of St. Anne's Church, which he contended was the Pool of Bethesda. Further archaeological excavation in the area, in 1964, discovered the remains of the Byzantine and Crusader churches, Hadrian's Temple of Asclepius and Serapis, the small healing pools of the Asclepieion, the other of the two large pools, and the dam between them.[23] It was discovered that the Byzantine construction was built in the very heart of Hadrian's construction and contained the healing pools.[15][23]
