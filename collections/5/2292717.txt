They lost again, this time 14–7 as Ted Fritsch scored two touchdowns, and the Packers defense held on to the lead despite a fourth-quarter touchdown by the Giants.[10] By 1946, Mara had given over complete control of the team to his two sons.

However, they were beaten by the Sid Luckman-led Bears, 24–14.[10]
