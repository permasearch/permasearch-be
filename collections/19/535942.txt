Phoenicians were known for being very religious. While there remain favourable aspects regarding Canaanite religion,[83][84][85] several of its reported practices have been widely criticized, in particular, temple prostitution,[86] and child sacrifice.[87] "Tophets" built "to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire" are condemned by God in Jeremiah 7:30-32, and in 2nd Kings 23:10 (also 17:17). Notwithstanding these and other important differences, cultural religious similarities between the ancient Hebrews and the Phoenicians persisted.[83][88]
