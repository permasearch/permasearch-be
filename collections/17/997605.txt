Khrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards,[145] and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements.[146] Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel.[147] Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over 700,000 Soviet citizens travelled abroad in 1957) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity.[147] In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed Komsomol officials to "smother foreign guests in our embrace".[148] The resulting "socialist carnival" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself.[149] According to historian Vladislav Zubok, the festival "shattered propagandist clich√©s" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.[146]
