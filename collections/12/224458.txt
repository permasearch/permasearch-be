Despite his partial recovery evident in America, Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.[25][37] In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer.[5] He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912.[5] In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.[42]
