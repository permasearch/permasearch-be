North American caribou, have specialized counter-current vascular heat exchange in their nasal passages.[61] Temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control.[61] Incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lungs, and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the deer's breath is exhaled, used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly absorbed into the blood through the mucous membranes.[61] Like moose, caribou have specialized noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils.
