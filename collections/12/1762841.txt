The family is picking through the charred remains of the house when Frances finds their meager savings in a blackened jar. Hope is reborn for Frances, but eldest son Shayne angrily demands a reality check. When rebuilding seems impossible, Mr. Munimura arrives with professional town folk and supplies to rebuild. Whether stubborn independent Frances likes it or not, rebuilding has started as Mr. Munimura gives her a comforting hug.  Frances relents, but true to character, she states that all will be paid back.  Toys, clothes, and blankets are also provided for the children.  Frances only lets them build the house as far as it was before the fire.  Shayne, narrating, says that it took them six months to finish the rest of the house, and four years to pay everyone back, but that it brought them all closer together as a family.  Even though he hated Idaho at first, he still lives there, and has never been back to Los Angeles.
