On August 9th against the Kansas City Royals, Molina came in with 2 outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1-0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay occurred when a stray kitten had made it's way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for 2nd-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also proved to be the deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win 8-5.
