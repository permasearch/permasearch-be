From 1618 to 1629, a second church was constructed from stone by Father Hernando Cabrera.[3] In 1680 Father Juan Labo laid the foundations for the current church. This building was started in 1714 and completed in 1721 by Father Francisco Juan de Elorreaga, OSA. The Franciscans later administered the parish of San Pablo (which was then part of the province of Batangas) on April 4, 1794 with Father Andres Cabrera, OFM as parish priest.[4] Father Cabrera added the brick-stone wall and built a stone cemetery in 1796.[5]
