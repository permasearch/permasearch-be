Electricity from Transpower's national grid is distributed to local lines companies and large industrial users via 180 grid exit points (GXPs) at 147 locations. Large industrial companies, such as New Zealand Steel at Glenbrook, the Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill at Kawerau, and the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter near Bluff, draw directly from Transpower substations and not the local lines companies' local grids.
