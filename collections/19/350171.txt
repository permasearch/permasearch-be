In 2006, rapper Jim Jones approached VH1 executives to make a reality show about him.[2] Jim Ackerman, senior vice president of development and production at the time, was intrigued by the idea[3] and paired him with producers Stefan Springman and Toby Barraud of Eastern TV. Jones was unwilling to fully commit to the gruelling filming schedule and was dealing with the murder of a friend at the time, leading him to lash out violently at the producers and filming crew. The production issues were worked into the show's concept, which now focused on the culture clash between the gangsta rapper and the "honky" television producers.[2] The 11-minute presentation tape, Keeping Up with the Joneses,[4] also featured Jones' longtime girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and his mother Nancy. According to Springman, VH1 loved the footage but were unsure if audiences would be invested in the concept full time.[5]
