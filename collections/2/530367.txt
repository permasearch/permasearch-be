As of 2009[update], 8% of Israeli Jews defined themselves as Haredim; an additional 12% as "religious"; 13% as "religious-traditionalists" ; 25% as "non-religious-traditionalists" (not strictly adhering to Jewish law or halakha); and 42% as "secular" (Hebrew: חִלּוֹנִי‬, Hiloni).[12] As of 1999[update], 65% of Israeli Jews believed in God,[13] and 85% participate in a Passover seder.[14] However, other sources indicate that between 15% and 37% of Israelis identify themselves as either atheists or agnostics.[15][unreliable source?] A survey conducted in 2009 showed that 80% of Israeli Jews believed in God, with 46% of them self-reporting as secular.[16] Israelis tend not to align themselves with a movement of Judaism (such as Reform Judaism or Conservative Judaism) but instead tend to define their religious affiliation by degree of their religious practice.
