One such difference is the use of a floating polypropylene guide line. Most cave divers in the U.S. balk at the use of any sort of floating guide line, 6Â mm nylon line is the norm in UK and is regularly anchored to stones, lead weights, or whatever is needed these belays are laid clear of mud and silt. In continental Europe, thinner yet slightly buoyant line is typical. Cave diving practices in some localities may be different than those in other parts of the world because those caves require specialized techniques.[citation needed]
