Harrison began recording his long-awaited[47] follow-up to All Things Must Pass in October 1972,[48][49] having been sidetracked with issues relating to the Concert for Bangladesh for over a year.[50][51] The Magic Is Here Again[52] and The Light That Has Lighted the World[53] were each rumoured to be the new album's title until Apple Records announced it as Living in the Material World.[54] Inglis views "Living in the Material World" as an ideal title track for the album, given "the internal dialogue in which he was engaging at the time".[26] Leng describes Harrison as "a man positively pregnant with vision" following the "overwhelming success" of his solo career since the Beatles' break-up, and suggests that a visit he made to India with American musician Gary Wright in early 1972 was a contributing factor.[55][nb 1]
