The Super Goal is a similar concept in Australian rules football, in which a 50-meter (55Â yd) arc determines the value of a goal; within the arc, it is the usual 6 points, but 9 points are scored for a "super goal" scored from outside the arc. To date the super goal is only used in pre-season games and not in the season proper.[23]
