In 1985, development of the longer range 747-400 began.[86] The variant had a new glass cockpit, which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three,[87] new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400.[1] The -400 entered service in 1989.[88]
