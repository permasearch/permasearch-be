Father Damien is first seen when Hillary introduces him to Agnes after he comes to Finglas to replace Father Quinn. He is strong to protest against Agnes' play version of the Nativity. However, he gives in and gets permission from the Bishop once Agnes gets him to make amends with his own mother over the phone. He baptizes the Brown triplets and later visits Agnes, but accidentally causes her to act-up after he accidentally says one of the hypnosis words that turns her into a stripper (as the hypnotist at the baptism party didn't completely remove the hypnosis from her). When Rory and Dino are getting married, he tells Agnes (despite her protests) that he cannot bless them as the Church is against same-sex marriage. But he later shows up at the Brown house to celebrate their marriage as he personally is happy to celebrate all forms of love.
