This also marked the first addition of a new sponsor to the Wood Brothers team. A trio of corporate sponsors—7-Eleven, Citgo, and Chief Auto Parts—were brought on board with the Petty and the Wood Brothers for 1985. As part of their marketing strategy, the Wood Brothers were required to relinquish their world-famous No. 21 car number and adopt the No. 7 in favor of the 7-Eleven sponsorship. This led to a major discourse with fans of the team, who knew the No. 21 synonymous with the legendary team from Virginia.
