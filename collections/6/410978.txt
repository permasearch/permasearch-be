The 1910 approach, which came into naked-eye view around 10 April[59] and came to perihelion on 20 April,[59] was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained.[15] Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 AU,[59] making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet.[78][79] One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen,[80] which led astronomer Camille Flammarion to claim that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas "would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet."[81] His pronouncement led to panicked buying of gas masks and quack "anti-comet pills" and "anti-comet umbrellas" by the public.[82] In reality, as other astronomers were quick to point out, the gas is so diffuse that the world suffered no ill effects from the passage through the tail.[81]
