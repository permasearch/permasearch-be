Japanese workers were prized for their ability to repair boats, as well as their skills as fishermen.[13] These skills places them in direct competition with European and First Nations fishers.[18] Due to the nature of the jobs they performed, Japanese men were not seen as 'feminine', as the Chinese tended to be viewed. Although they were still segregated from other workers, they would have been paid more, and they were higher on the social scale. The Japanese played an important role in canneries right up until World War II, when many Japanese men were interned for the duration of the war. At this time, many of their fishing vessels were also confiscated, making it difficult for these fishermen to return after the war.[19] Despite this treatment, many Japanese men did return to cannery life in the aftermath of the war, though the return was slow, and was not welcomed by all.
