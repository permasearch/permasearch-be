In December 2013, the Belgian Senate voted in favour of extending its euthanasia law to terminally ill children.  Conditions imposed on children seeking euthanasia are that "the patient must be conscious of their decision and understand the meaning of euthanasia", "the request must have been approved by the child's parents and medical team", "their illness must be terminal" and "they must be in great pain, with no available treatment to alleviate their distress".[17]  A psychologist must also determine the patient's maturity to make the decision. The amendment emphasizes that the patient's request be voluntary.[18] The first minor to be euthanized under these new regulations occurred in September 2016.[19]
