Durant was a member of the Bush-Cheney '04 Veterans Team[8] and the McCain '08 Veterans team. In this political capacity for McCain, he criticized the presumptive Presidential Democratic candidate, Senator Barack Obama. for having cancelled a planned trip to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) near Ramstein Air Base in Germany where he had intended, while in Europe. to visit American casualties of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Durant said he thought this was inappropriate for a potential commander in chief.[9] Obama felt that he did not want to exploit the visit for the benefit of his campaign, prior to the election, but he did telephone those recovering military patients there and also paid a visit to a military hospital in Baghdad and to troops in Afghanistan. Retired two-star Air Force general Scott Gration, who advised the campaign and traveled with Obama on the trip said: “Senator Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go.”[10]
