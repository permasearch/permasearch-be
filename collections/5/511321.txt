Donkey Kong has been described as one of the most iconic mascots for Nintendo.[19][20] In their 250th issue in January 2010, Nintendo Power ranked him as their eighth-favorite Nintendo hero, stating that while he is a somewhat goofy hero, he is decently good overall and an entertaining one. They also ranked him as their eighth-favorite Nintendo villain, joking that one should avoid him if he isn't wearing a tie.[21] IGN criticized his tie, stating "DK needs a fashion makeover". They said that while he "used to be a working icon", "his status is starting to show signs of rust".[22] 1UP.com listed him as the most "Gracelessly Aging Character", citing the fact that the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game eventually became Cranky Kong.[23] IGN ranked him 5th in their "Top 100 Videogames Villains" list for his earlier appearances.[24] UGO.com listed Donkey Kong seventh on their list of "The 25 Awesomest Hidden Characters" for his cameo appearance in Punch-Out!!.[25] Empire also included him on their list of the 50 greatest video game characters, adding that he is "the worst named character in the history of gaming".[26] The 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition lists Donkey Kong as the 33rd-most popular video game character.[27] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 25th-best hero in video games.[28]
