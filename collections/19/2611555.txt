Throughout his college career and early in his years with the Detroit Pistons, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, rebounds and assists. Touted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that he was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players in his era.[1] After his first six seasons with the Pistons, in which he averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, his next twelve seasons were mostly injury plagued, as he averaged just 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, after 19 years in the league, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA.[2] Hill and Tony Ressler officially purchased the Atlanta Hawks on June 24, 2015 for an estimated $730 million[3] â€“ $850 million.[4][5]
