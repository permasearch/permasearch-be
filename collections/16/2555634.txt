The Employment and Social Insurance Act was a statute, enacted by the Parliament of Canada in 1935, during the final months of the government of R.B. Bennett. The Act was intended to introduce a nationwide employment insurance scheme, and also to convince voters that Bennett was willing to intervene aggressively in the economy, as President Roosevelt had done in the United States with the New Deal. The Act was a key component of the program of interventionist laws known as "Bennett's New Deal."
