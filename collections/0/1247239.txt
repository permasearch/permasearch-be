In Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Skipper and the penguins salvage a crashed airplane to fly back to New York. They fix the plane when it crashes in Africa with the help of "more thumbs" (Mason and Phil). At the end of the movie, he marries a bobblehead doll. In The Penguins of Madagascar, the bobble head is nowhere to be seen.
