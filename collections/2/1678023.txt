In urban areas, those that do not receive water from the piped network often have to purhchase expensive water of dubious quality from private water vendors. For example, in Delhi water trucks get water from illegal wells on the banks of the Yamuna River for 0.75 rupees per gallon (about USD 2.70/m3).[15]
