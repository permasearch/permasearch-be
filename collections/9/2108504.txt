Though the reputation of tailoring on Savile Row is for made-to-measure suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves & Hawkes,[65] a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy tailor founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and tailor to the British Army.[66] Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of tailoring in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London,[67] he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team,[68] and for the 1968 film 2001: Space Odyssey,[69] and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977.[70] Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No.Â 14.[70] Though Amies sold the business and retired in 2001, the company is still operating from No. 14, now under the control of Fung Capital.[71]
