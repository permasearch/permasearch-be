The "tragicomic tale of love gone sour and shattered dreams" was the subject of BBC Radio 4's Soul Music series on 22 December 2015, with a repeat on the same station on 26 December 2015 and then on the BBC iPlayer.  Among those appearing in the programme were The Pogues' pianist James Fearnley — who tells how "the song started off as a transatlantic love story between an Irish seafarer missing his girl at Christmas before becoming the bittersweet reminiscences of the Irish immigrant down on his luck in the Big Apple" — and Irish Gaelic footballer Alisha Jordan, who was inspired by the song's words to recover and to not be overcome by facial injuries she received when a stranger attacked her in a New York City street.[28]
