Oh Sangwoo is the second main character of Killing Stalking. He is a classmate of Yoon Bum and is enlisted in the same military unit as him. He saves Bum from sexual assault by his superiors, which causes Sangwoo to become the object of Bum's obsessive affections. Sangwoo adopts a "happy, energetic" face, a light-hearted teasing tone, and is often shown to be smiling, even when making eye-contact with strangers. In contrast to Bum, Sangwoo is popular, has a large circle of friends, and is considered very attractive. According to Bum, Sangwoo's "empathetic, considerate, gentle aura" has ensnared many. However, these traits mask more psychopathic, sadistic characteristics. A victim of an abusive father and a horrible home environment, Sangwoo murdered both of his parents while he was in high school. When facing his victims, his emotions vacillate between mercy and violent hostility; this dynamic allows him to ensnare Yoon Bum, as he shows Bum enough mercy for Bum to consider himself a favorite of Sangwoo's. Sangwoo tends to consider people who are fooled by his public face to be beneath him. He uses harsh language with his victims, including expletives and slurs. He appears to favor female victims but is not hesitant about displaying violence toward men, despite, as he tells Yoon Bum, not having murdered a man since his father's death in high school.
