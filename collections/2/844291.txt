Tower 1 opened on March 31, 2008, with 1,282 rooms.[2] The hotel features two restaurants: DJT, named after the developer, and a poolside restaurant, H2(eau).[3] Due to the overwhelming seller's response from the first tower, Trump announced that a second, identical tower would be built next to the first tower; the mid-2000s recession put that plan on indefinite hold. It is Las Vegas's tallest residential building at 640 feet (200Â m).[4] In September 2012, the Trump Organization announced that it sold roughly 300 condominium units in Trump International Hotel Las Vegas to Hilton Worldwide's timeshare division, Hilton Grand Vacations.[5]
