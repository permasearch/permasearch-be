The song received critical acclaim from music critics, and was named the 20th best song of 2017 by Rolling Stone.[4] According to Entertainment Weekly, the song, in which Swift says she is "doing better than [she] ever was" and details her romantic life, was well-received by her fan base.[9] Frank Guan of Vulture stated that the song "deals in gossamer and light; its spare, airy production evokes, or attempts to evoke, a sense of radiant, protective romance in the wake of a devastating social debacle; listeners ready to view that loss as the one she suffered last year at the hands of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West will meet no resistance."[10] USA Today gave it a positive review, saying it was more subdued than her other recent singles, and "the most perceptive and unabashedly romantic song of the singer's new era," and "surprisingly effective and grown-up."[11] Complex Magazine had the opinion that the song was the first single pre-released from her album that was not "distressing," as "Call It What You Want" is "actually good," and also dropped the "revenge narrative to great effect." [12] Spin Magazine gave it a similar review, saying it was much better than her other recent material.[13]
