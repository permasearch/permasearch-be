Probst also pointed out that Game Changers was being cast even while the 33rd season, Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, was still filming. Because of this, two of the 20 slots for Game Changers were reserved for Season 33 players, in case producers wanted to ask any of them back. If no one from that season were deemed suitable, producers had two earlier players in mind for the final two spots.[4] Worlds Apart co-runner-up Carolyn Rivera was one of the players considered for this season's cast, but she was cut by producers at the last moment.[6] Her spot was given to Michaela Bradshaw from Millennials vs. Gen X.[4] San Juan del Sur winner Natalie Anderson was originally cast on the season as well, but she ultimately had to back out shortly before filming began due to medical reasons.[7] Her spot on the cast was filled on short notice by Worlds Apart contestant Sierra Dawn Thomas.[8]
