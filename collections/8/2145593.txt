The Titan Transformers U.K. magazine would reveal Jazz's role in the departure of the Allspark from Cybertron. When it was jettisoned into space he, Ironhide and Ratchet hit the pursuing Megatron with a tractor beam, dragging him back to Cybertron. They were no match for his firepower, but the Decepticon leader, realizing they were just stalling him, called in Devastator. He proved impervious to their firepower, and seemingly eliminated them all with a foldspace warhead, with Megatron commenting they were "lost in space".
