In journalism, digital media and citizen journalism have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers.[24] But the rise of digital journalism has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations.[25] E-books and self-publishing are changing the book industry, and digital textbooks and other media-inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education.[26][27] In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, called digital scholarship, and new fields of study, such as digital humanities and digital history. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society.[12] Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media.
