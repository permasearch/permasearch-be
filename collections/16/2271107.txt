Things get serious quickly when their new host, Bob Harper, starts off with their first temptation. Everyone gets on the treadmill and goes at their desired pace. Bob starts off with giving $5,000 to anyone who's willing to push their button. But, once they push the button, they also quit the game. No one budges and he goes up to $10,000. Again, no one budges but one contestant nearly collapses. Bob tells her that she'll be okay and she didn't quit because she never pushed the button. He makes a final push and offers everyone $25,000 to anyone who wants to quit. Every team resists the cash and earns the right to enter the gym. But it's just the beginning.
