The largest hindrance to effectively organizing the militia was the scattered population of only 14,273; and of this number, the majority were scattered around the state on isolated farms. The only real town in Arkansas in 1820 was Arkansas Post, a tiny village of no more than forty houses. To make matters worse, there were few roads in Territorial Arkansas, thereby making communication with the militiamen very difficult.[61] Adjutant General A. P. Spencer noted that some militia units were unable to drill since "the extent of Territory they cover is to [sic] great to muster them at one point..."[62] As late as 1827, Governor George Izard was complaining of the difficulty of organizing the rural Arkansans into a cohesive militia force: "The scattered state of our Population here and the constant changes of Residence among the Inhabitants make it impractical to organize the Militia in such a manner as may render their Service prompt and efficient".[63]
