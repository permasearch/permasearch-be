NCVS surveys households randomly selected from a stratified multistage cluster sample, with the interviews administered by the United States Census Bureau.[4] This methodology has some disadvantages for surveying domestic violence crimes, since the entire selected household (above age 12) is interviewed instead of just one member selected.[4] The selected household remains in the survey sample for three years, with interviews conducted every six months.[5] Critics also argue that there is no way to verify much of the information gathered.
