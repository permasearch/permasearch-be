In his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,[122] and he used the word "canonized" (kanonizomena) in regards to them.[123] The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the Synod of Hippo Regius in North Africa (393 AD); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419).[124] These councils were under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed.[125][126][127]
