Islamabad was built during the 1960s to replace Karachi as Pakistan's capital. The city's master-plan divides the city into eight zones, including administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational sectors, industrial sectors, commercial areas, and rural and green areas. The city is known for the presence of several parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and Shakarparian Park.[9] The city is home to several landmarks, including the Faisal Mosque, the largest mosque in South Asia[10] and the fourth largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan's National Monument and Democracy Square.[11][12][13]
