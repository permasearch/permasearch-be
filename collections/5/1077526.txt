The basic science building was the first building constructed on the School of Medicine grounds, which were east of Revelle College and north of New Miramar Road (later renamed La Jolla Village Drive). The first cohort of 32 students enrolled in 1968, while construction on the clinical science building and adjacent 100-bed Veterans Administration Hospital were still ongoing. The inaugural class in 1971 achieved the highest score in the country on the National Board of Medical Examiners Step 1 Examination, propelling the young School into the national spotlight. The school's first degrees were conferred upon them in 1972.[4] Clinical rotations took place at the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest, which had been constructed by the county in 1963 and leased to the university in 1966.[5]
