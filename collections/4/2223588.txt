Pope Calixtus III in a bull issued 23 September 1456 declares seven years' indulgence for those who visit Our Lady of Zaragoza. The text of the bull specifically mentions a pillar, for the first time suggesting the existence of an image known as Our Lady of the Pillar.[7] The feast day of 12 October was officially introduced by the Council of Zaragoza in 1640.[8]
