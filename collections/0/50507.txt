Filming of the interior scenes of "St. Aiden's" utilised both The Leeds Studios and St. Luke's Hospital, Bradford, the latter of which was chosen because it had not been updated in many years, and retained the appearance of what a hospital would appear like in the 1960s.[citation needed] The exterior scenes of the fictional hospital used the Red Court building on Holbeck Road, within Scarborough's South Cliff, and included the nearby park area and Holbeck Clock Tower; scenes were shot during the summer months.[1][2] [3]The remaining scenes outside the hospital covered the area of the North Riding of Yorkshire, including Whitby and Scarborough.
