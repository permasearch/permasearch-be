The celebration is for Latin American girls (or "Latinas" in the US) who, on turning fifteen are no longer considered children, and are honored and introduced into their community as young women. Contemporary festivities combine Spanish-Catholic traditions with those of Aztec and other indigenous heritages and add in a few modern twists. In ancient Mexico, the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples had many different ceremonies to mark the passage through the various stages of life. The quinceaÃ±era marked a young woman's transition to adulthood, as she was presented, as a virgin, to the community for probable suitors.[3]
