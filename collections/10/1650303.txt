The men are dragged out at one location, while Brandy is driven to a second location. She is given a camera and told to film everything she sees. The group members wander through their respective rooms. Zack, in a darkened room with nothing but a glowstick, is bludgeoned to death by an actor. The rest of the group are terrorized before being driven to a remote area and buried alive in coffins by the Blue Skeleton members.
