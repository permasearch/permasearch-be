Work by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat and monkey visual cortexes contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field[citation needed]. Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields[citation needed]. Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space[citation needed]. The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field[citation needed].
