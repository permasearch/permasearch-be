Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle in the first season, continued to appear in season two. Although still considered guest actors, their characters started to become more fully developed and play larger roles in the episodes.[46][47] Several other actors played regular supporting roles throughout the second season. Jama Williamson continued her recurring role as Wendy, Tom Haverford's ex-wife who becomes a romantic interest for Ron Swanson.[48][49] Mo Collins and Jay Jackson made repeated appearances as Pawnee journalists Joan Callamezzo and Perd Hapley. Both actors were originally expected to appear only in one episode, but both returned for subsequent episodes because the writing staff enjoyed their performances.[50] Alison Becker played another Pawnee reporter, Shauna Malwae-Tweep, a character she also played in the first season.[51] Ben Schwartz played Jean-Ralphio, an arrogant and fast-talking playboy friend of Tom, in several episodes.[52][53] Pamela Reed reprised her recurring role as Leslie's mother, Marlene, in several second-season episodes.[48]
