The CCA, though noticing how thin McGlohon's petition was, denied Kerr's appeal. When Kerr could not contact McGlohan, he wrote to the court and asked for another lawyer and a new appeal. McGlohan submitted an affidavit in which he admitted "it may be that I was not competent to represent Mr. Kerr." He blamed a lack of experience and health problems. Prosecutors told the court they would not oppose Kerr's motion for a new lawyer.[4]
