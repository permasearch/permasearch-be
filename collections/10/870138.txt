Bree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal.[4] In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle called Cross "almost too perfect as uptight Bree", and applauds her for "managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect."[5] At the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role,[6] following the first year's emphasis on Susan Mayer.[7] Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season,[8] Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery. Cross retained her centre-stage position for the show's third season, which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband Orson.[9] Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third,[10] and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a "loss of steam" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.[11] Season 4's "fake pregnancy" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most "hysterical [storyline] yet", and singling Cross out for praise.[12][13] Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight. Following the five year leap, a new direction was taken with Bree's character as she made the transition from housewife to author/businesswoman, a development which received positive reception.[14] This change in character development was continued into season 6, with another side to Bree's personality being shown, which includes an affair with Karl Mayer. Critics lauded the comic relief provided by these developments,[14] as well as the more poignant and emotional turn mid-season as Bree deals with Orson's paralysis.[15] In Season 7, Bree finds herself newly divorced and embarks on a relationship with Keith Watson, a move which was praised for allowing "the for-so-long uptight Bree letting her hair down and having some fun for a change."[16] By the climax of season 7, Bree is central in covering up the murder of Gabrielle's stepfather, a move which was praised as a sound set up for the final season.[17]
