Irish banks correctly identify a systematic risk of triggering an even more severe financial crisis in Ireland if they were to call in the loans as they fall due. The loans are subject to terms and conditions, referred to as "covenants". These covenants are being waived[60] in fear of provoking the (inevitable) bankruptcy of many property developers[61] and banks are thought to be "lending some developers further cash to pay their interest bills, which means that they are not classified as 'bad debts' by the banks".[56] Furthermore, the banks' "impairment" (bad debt) provisions are still at very low levels.[62][63] This does not appear to be consistent with the real negative changes taking place in property market fundamentals.
