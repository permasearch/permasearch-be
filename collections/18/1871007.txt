On April 6, 2017, Howard signed with the Atlanta Braves in a minor-league contract. Howard started with Braves extended spring training in Florida before he was assigned to the Gwinnett Braves of the International League. If he was added to the 40-man roster, he would have received a $120,000 minor-league salary or a $750,000 major-league salary, plus potential bonuses based on plate appearances.[65] Braves general manager John Coppolella explained that Howard's signing was "just a no-risk proposition for a player with good makeup who was excellent in the second half last season, he's in good shape and has been training and waiting for an opportunity."[66] However, he hit just .184 with one home run and 11 strikeouts in 42 plate appearances for Gwinnett, and was released on May 8.[67]
