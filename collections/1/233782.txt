On the journey home, Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and taking care of only one man, visibly upsetting Adam. When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is the oldest of seven brothers living under the same roof. The brothers have been named Bible names alphabetically: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense, due to no Bible names beginning with F and their mother thought he smelled sweet), and Gideon. All of the brothers have red hair, and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall. Milly is also shocked at how filthy dirty their house is, along with how bad-tempered and ill-mannered Adam and his brothers are. At first, Milly believes that Adam wanted a servant girl instead of a wife, but Adam tells her that living in the backwoods is a hard life, and men and women have to work alongside each other to survive.
