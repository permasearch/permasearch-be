In the late 1780s the state of Georgia grew eager to firm up its trans-Appalachian land claim, and to fill the great demand for land to develop. The territory claimed by Georgia, which it called the "Yazoo lands," ran west from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River, and included most of the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi (between 31° N and 35° N). The southern portion of this region was also claimed by Spain as part of Spanish Florida. One of Georgia's efforts to accomplish its goals for the region, a 1794 plan developed by governor George Mathews and the Georgia General Assembly, became a major political scandal, known as the Yazoo land scandal.
