The emergence of political parties and nationally coordinated election campaigns during the 1790s (which the Constitution's framers had not contemplated) soon frustrated this original plan. In the election of 1796, Federalist John Adams came in first, but because the Federalist electors had divided their second vote amongst several vice presidential candidates, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson came second. Thus, the president and vice president were from opposing parties. Conflict between the two arose early on over the increasingly turbulent relations between the U.S. and France. Ultimately, Jefferson became more an "opposition leader", and actively sought to frustrate the president's policies. Then, in the election of 1800, Democratic-Republican electors (for reasons that are disputed), though clearly preferring Jefferson over Aaron Burr, the party's secondary candidate, sought to guarantee that their party won both offices, and cast 37 electoral votes for both Jefferson and Burr. In the contingent election that followed, Jefferson finally won on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president.[35]
