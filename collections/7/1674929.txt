The Walt Disney World Casting Center is the official center for employment and recruiting for the Walt Disney World Resort. Designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and built by Orlando-based design-build company, H. J. High Construction, the building opened in 1989.[1] The Casting Center is located across from the Disney Springs complex near the Team Disney building and borders the Walt Disney World property on Interstate 4 with the purpose of advertising Walt Disney World job opportunities to commuters traveling by on the busy interstate.
