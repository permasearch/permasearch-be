Oxidation states can be useful for balancing chemical equations for oxidationâ€“reduction (or redox) reactions, because the changes in the oxidized atoms have to be balanced by the changes in the reduced atoms. For example, in the reaction of acetaldehyde with the Tollens' reagent to acetic acid (shown below), the carbonyl carbon atom changes its oxidation state from +1 to +3 (by two electrons). This oxidation is balanced by reducing two Ag+ ions to Ag0 (by two electrons in total).
