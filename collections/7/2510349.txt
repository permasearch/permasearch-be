Dr. Ley is also studying the immune response that happens as a result of the inflammation caused by lung injury. The first hours of the inflammation determine the progression and ultimate outcome of the disease. Dr. Ley is working on the role of selectins in inhibiting the inflammatory response in the beginning stages, thus reducing the degree of disease infiltration. "You can get away with blocking the inflammation for a few hours, which may be enough to intervene and maintain oxygen flow," said Dr. Ley.
