In early 1171, the Venetians attacked and largely destroyed the Genoese quarter in Constantinople. The Emperor retaliated by ordering the mass arrest of all Venetians throughout the Empire and the confiscation of their property. About 10,000 Venetians are said to have been arrested on 12 March 1171. That and the following embargo put the whole trade at stake. A subsequent Venetian expedition in the Aegean failed despite 120 galleys being sent: a direct assault was impossible due to the strength of the imperial forces. Tumults and riots occurred; the doge was killed in the streets. The Venetians agreed to negotiations, which the Emperor stalled intentionally. As talks dragged on through the winter, the Venetian fleet waited at Chios, until an outbreak of the plague forced them to withdraw.
