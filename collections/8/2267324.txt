In 2015, Pete Holmes finished writing a pilot episode for a new comedy series partly based on his experiences as an up-and-coming stand-up comic. The episode was directed by Judd Apatow who also served as executive producer along with Holmes and Dave Rath, Holmes' manager. It marked Apatow's first venture as the director of a pilot.[5] The two first met in 2012 when Apatow was a guest on Holmes' podcast, You Made It Weird.[6] A former stand-up comic for seven years, Apatow was inspired to return to it after hearing Amy Schumer tell stories while touring and Holmes' enthusiasm towards the profession.[7]
