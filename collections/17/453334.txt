Economists consider that NAFTA was beneficial for the United States.[53][54] In a 2012 survey of leading economists, 95% said that on average U.S. citizens benefited from NAFTA.[7] A 2001 Journal of Economic Perspectives review found that NAFTA was a net benefit to the United States.[8] A 2015 study found that US welfare increased by 0.08% as a result of NAFTA tariff reductions, and that US intra-bloc trade increased by 41%.[38]
