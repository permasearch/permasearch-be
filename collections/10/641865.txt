The company was founded in 1847 in Newcastle, Ontario, by Daniel Massey,[2] as the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory. To begin with it made some of the world's first mechanical threshers, at first by assembling parts from the United States, but eventually designing and building its own equipment. Daniel's eldest son, Hart Massey, renamed the enterprise the Massey Manufacturing Co. and in 1879 moved it to Toronto,[3] where it soon became one of the city's leading employers. The massive collection of factories, consisting of a 4.4 hectares (11 acres) site with plant and head office at 915 King Street West (now part of Liberty Village), became one of the best known features of the city. Massey expanded further and began to sell its products internationally.[3] Through extensive advertising campaigns it became one of the most well known brands in Canada. A labour shortage throughout the country also helped to make the firm's mechanized equipment very attractive.
