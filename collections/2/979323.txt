In January 2017, Steve Harvey made jokes on Steve Harvey about Asian men, ridiculing the idea that any white woman or black woman would want to date them. "Excuse me, do you like Asian men?", he said, "No, thank you." He went on to add, "I donâ€™t even like Chinese food."[42] The remarks were met with criticism from members of the Asian American community, including New York lawmakers[43] and author Eddie Huang.[44] He targeted Asian men in a string of racist jokes,[45] implying Asian men are not attractive.[46] To which he apologized on his talk show (and Twitter), saying: "I offer my humblest apology for offending anyone, particularly those in the Asian community. ... "It was not my intention and the humor was not meant with any malice or disrespect whatsoever."[47]
