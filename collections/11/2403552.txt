Mike Wolfe, an independent candidate, became the first directly elected mayor after an election on 17 October 2002, narrowly beating Labour Party candidate George Stevenson by just 300 votes.[67] The elected Mayor from 5 May 2005 to 5 June 2009 was Mark Meredith (Labour Party).[68] The 2005 election was notable because about 10% of the ballot papers were either spoiled or ineligible.[69] Meredith's election platform included a pledge to have another referendum on the post of elected mayor.[70] This was scheduled for May 2007 and resulted in the abolition of the mayoral system.
