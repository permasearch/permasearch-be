While Dixieland and swing music were both designed for the enjoyment of listeners, and in the case of swing, for dancers, bebop was more of a "musician's music", designed for listening. While there are important bebop tunes with vocals and lyrics, many of the most important bebop tunes are instrumentals. Bebop used complex chord progressions, unusual altered chords and extended chords, and extensive modulations, including to remote keys that are not closely related to the tonic key (the "main" key or "home key" of a song). Whereas Dixieland and swing tunes might have one chord change every two bars with some sections with one chord change per bar, bebop tunes often had two chord changes per bar with many changing key every four bars. In addition, since Bebop was written for listening rather than dancing, the tempi were not constrained by the need for danceability; as a result, bebop tunes were often faster than those of the swing era.
