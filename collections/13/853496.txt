Catharina discovers that Griet used her earrings, accuses her mother of complicity, and asks Vermeer to show her the Griet portrait. Heartbroken that he does not consider her worthy of being painted merely because she "doesn't understand"; Catharina tries but fails to destroy the painting. She further banishes Griet from the house forever, to which Vermeer does not object, and let Griet leave. Later, Griet is visited by Vermeer's house cook, who comes bearing her a gift: the blue headscarf she wore in the painting, wrapped around Catharina's pearl earrings.
