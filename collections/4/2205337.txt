Regarding household size, the relationship is not proportional (two occupants do not dispose of twice as much food waste as one occupant);[41] single-occupancy households, on average, throw away 3.2 kilograms (7.1 lb): per week the least food waste by weight but the most proportionately.[42] This disproportional wastage has been partially attributed to food packaging sizes being largely inappropriate for people living on their own.[31] Families with children (under the age of 16), on a per household per week basis, are shown to waste the most food by weight (7.3 kilograms (16 lb));[43] when taken individually however, members of a family that includes children waste the least food (1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb)).[42][44] Contrary to both previous research and conventional wisdom, the report discovered that older people waste as much avoidable food as younger people (1.2 kg per person per week);[38] in terms of mean average cost and weight of food waste, older people do waste less, although for retired households this may be because they are smaller.[45][46]
