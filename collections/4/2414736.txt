Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its network run. The best known example of this is the original series of Star Trek, which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969, gaining only modest ratings, but became a worldwide phenomenon after it entered off-network syndication. Its success in syndication led to the Star Trek film series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the later versions in the franchise.[17]:91â€“92
