Jeremy Winograd of Slant Magazine claimed that, "The result is by far Arcade Fire's most upbeat and easily digestible album to date."[26] Barry Nicolson of NME wrote that "The Canadian art-rockers are bigger, bolder and more fearful of the future than ever" rating it five stars out of five,[22] while Will Hermes of Rolling Stone praised the album for its lyrical content, writing that it is "treacherous territory, but the band navigates it bravely, especially when it turns the critical lens on itself."[25]
