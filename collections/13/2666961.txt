Ted and Dougal go to the cinema to find only a couple people there. They make a gentlemen's agreement with Michael, the cinema manager, to watch the film once and then peaceful protest it so that Michael can throw them out, making it look like a fuss. They return to the parochial house for the night, and discuss the film, agreeing it was difficult to understand and sexually explicit. The next morning, Brennan returns and forces them to start early on their protest, despite the fact the cinema is not yet open. They half-heartedly stand around the cinema, waving placards that say "Down with this sort of thing" and "Careful now". Ted has Dougal buy them handcuffs to chain themselves to the railings outside the cinema, hoping that will increase attention. However, they find their protests have the opposite effect, as people are drawn in to see the film.
