Depending on the anisotropy and polydispersity of the system, a resulting plot of (Γ/q2) vs. q2 may or may not show an angular dependence. Small spherical particles will show no angular dependence, hence no anisotropy. A plot of (Γ/q2) vs. q2 will result in a horizontal line. Particles with a shape other than a sphere will show anisotropy and thus an angular dependence when plotting of (Γ/q2) vs. q2 .[9] The intercept will be in any case the Dt. Thus there is an optimum angle of detection θ for each particle size. A high quality analysis should always be performed at several scattering angles (multiangle DLS). This becomes even more important in a polydisperse sample with an unknown particle size distribution. At certain angles the scattering intensity of some particles will completely overwhelm the weak scattering signal of other particles, thus making them invisible to the data analysis at this angle. DLS instruments which only work at a fixed angle can only deliver good results for some particles. Thus the indicated precision of a DLS instrument with only one detection angle is only ever true for certain particles.
