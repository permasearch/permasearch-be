This is the first match for which a full scorecard including dismissals has survived and it is the opening entry in Scores & Biographies. Haygarth, however, gave the date as 1746 instead of 1744. In his Dawn of Cricket, Waghorn specified a source called the London Magazine, published in 1744, which reported the match on page 307.[11] The scorecard presents the problem of players sharing names and not being differentiated by the scorers, whom Haygarth denounced for their "laziness". It was not until the 1772 season that scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis.
