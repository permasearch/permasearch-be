Spiders have been the focus of stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries.[111] They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for prey, as well as mischief and malice due to their venomous bites.[112] The Italian tarantella is a dance to rid the young woman of the lustful effects of a spider bite.
