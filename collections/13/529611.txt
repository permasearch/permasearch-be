She next appeared in the 1979 film Star Trek: The Motion Picture as the chief  transporter operator and non-commissioned officer on board the Enterprise.[56] During the events of The Voyage Home, Rand was stationed in San Francisco as a communications officer, but was reunited with the other former members of the Enterprise when they are court-martialed at the end of the film. She subsequently served as a communications officer aboard the USS Excelsior during the events of The Undiscovered Country.[57] The character's final appearance on screen was as part of Tuvok's memories of that final film, as part of the Voyager episode "Flashback".[58] Afterwards, Whitney remained hopeful that a new Captain Sulu based series would be created, allowing her to return to the role of Rand once more.[59]
