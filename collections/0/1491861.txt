In 2016, CBS extended the selection show to a two-hour format; however, the new special was criticized by viewers for being too padded, while the full bracket was leaked shortly into the broadcast.[14][15] In 2017, the selection show was shortened to a 90-minute format. Beginning with 2018, the selection show will return to a two-hour format, but the special aired on TBS instead, marking the first time since 1982 that the official bracket unveiling has not aired on CBS.[16][17] The Selection Show will now alternate between TBS and CBS with TBS airing the Selection Show in even numbered years, with CBS airing the Selection Show in odd numbered years.[18]
