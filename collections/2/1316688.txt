"I Don't Fuck with You" was produced by DJ Mustard and Kanye West and samples the D. J. Rogers song "Say You Love Me One More Time" (1976), with the closing adlibs being performed over a slightly sped-up version of the Earth, Wind & Fire song "September" (1978). The clean edit of the song produced for radio airplay does not contain either the word "fuck" or other words in the lyrics prohibited by the FCC.
