Kemp hit home runs in five straight games to end the season, the first major league player to accomplish that feat and the first Dodger since Shawn Green in the 2001 season to hit homers in five consecutive games.[43] The only other Dodgers to homer in five consecutive games are Roy Campanella (1950), Adrian Gonzalez (2014â€“15), and Joc Pederson (2015).[44]
