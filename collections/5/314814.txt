On September 13, 2016, Burnett released her new Carol Burnett Show memoir titled In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox. The book, full of anecdotes about the 1967â€“1978 variety series, covers the history of how Burnett created the show, how she cast her co-stars, the co-star she once fired (and quickly rehired), and all the show's memorable characters (Mama, Eunice, Mr. Tudball, Mrs. Wiggins, and the rest).[22]
