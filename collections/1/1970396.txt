A charging grip is available for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power.[105] Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries.[89] Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it to be used for racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.[116] The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller.[74][117][118] As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode; however, currently[when?] this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the power adapter and HDMI cable.[116] Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors.[119] The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.[120]
