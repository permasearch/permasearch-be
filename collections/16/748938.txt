Benaderet and her first husband, actor Jim Bannon, met while employed at KHJ in Los Angeles.[8] They married in August 1938 and had two children: Jack (1940-2017);[78] and Maggie (b. March 4, 1947).[79] However, Bannon's heavy filming and touring schedule required for his portrayal of fictional cowboy hero Red Ryder took a toll on their marriage, and she filed for divorce in September 1950.[8] In 1957, Benaderet married Eugene Twombly, a sound effects technician for movies and television who had worked on The Jack Benny Program, and they remained together until her death in 1968. Her son Jack Bannon became an actor, making his television debut in bit parts on Petticoat Junction and working on the show as a dialogue coach, and later starred in Lou Grant.[78]
