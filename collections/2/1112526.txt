Players' uniform numbers were listed—and in Tom Cheek's case, the number of consecutive games he called for the Blue Jays[91]—until the 2013 All-Star Break, even though, with the exception of Roberto Alomar's, and Roy Halladay's these numbers have not been retired. During the 2013 All-Star Break, the Level of Excellence was redesigned for the addition of Carlos Delgado's name. The redesign removed all uniform numbers from the Level of Excellence aside from Roberto Alomar's retired #12, Roy Halladay's retired #32 and Tom Cheek's 4306 for his consecutive games called streak.[92]
