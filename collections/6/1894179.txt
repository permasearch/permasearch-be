Master Fish and Mistress Fowl take Jacob from his cell and lead him to the prison.  They have similar faces to the people that Jacob saw when he was in the store. As they walk towards the prison they tell Jacob scary stories and point out the smog and crocodiles that block the way to the prison’s island.  When Jacob gets to the prison, he is introduced the fearsome warden, The Hooded Fang.  The warden reads Jacob’s sentence and sends him to the deepest and darkest cell in the prison.  The Hooded Fang tells Jacob that he hates children. He says that when he was a wrestler, he was feared by everyone.  During one match, a child pointed at him and laughed, telling the audience that the wrestler was not scary – only funny.  After this incident, the Hooded Fang was unable to fight, because everyone around him would laugh him out of the stadium.  Jacob apologizes to the Hooded Fang after hearing his story, telling him that he seems like a nice man.  The warden is furious, as he wants everyone to think of him as mean and scary, and sends Jacob to his cell.  As Jacob passes by the other cells, he notices that the children’s skin is gray in colour.  They beg Master Fish and Mistress Fowl for food, but are given only stale bread and moldy apples.  When Jacob reaches his cell, he finds some candy and a note that says, “You have a friend”.[11]
