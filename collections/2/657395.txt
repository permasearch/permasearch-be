Following owner Ralph Wilson's death on March 25, 2014 the club was put into a trust[200][201] and confirmed that it would be sold.[200] Wilson had never expressed any desire for his family to inherit the team,[175] and it was widely presumed that his heirs would sell the team to the highest bidder to pay the significant inheritance tax.[176][198][202] The franchise was thought to be worth more in a large market than in Buffalo,[203][204][205][206] with one expert putting its value in Buffalo at $950 million-$1 billion versus $1.5 billion in Toronto.[180]
