Founded in 2009, the World Within Reach Speaker Series (commonly known as Speaker Series) is UAlbany's premiere lecture series. It is a student-led initiative aimed at engaging the UAlbany community in a conversation on important issues. The program was launched by a group of student leaders in the Student Association and is funded by the Student Association, University Auxiliary Services, and the Alumni Association. The goal of the Speaker Series is to bring guests to campus in a broad range of areas: politics, global affairs, business, journalism, and popular culture. Past participants include Bill Clinton, Colin Powell, Howard Dean, Karl Rove, Barbara Walters, Bill Snape, Magic Johnson, Russell Simmons, David Axelrod, David Plouffe, Jon Favreau, Common, Bill Nye, Venus Williams, Daymond John, Brandon Stanton, Sonia Sotomayor, and Octavia Spencer.
