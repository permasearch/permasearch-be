While at Nellie Oleson's birthday party, Nellie pushes Laura and hurts her ankle. This leads to Laura becoming friends with Olga Nordstrom (Kim Richards), a quiet friendly girl from her school who was born with a birth defect causing her left leg to be shorter than the other. Charles has an idea for a way to help Olga, despite her embittered father Jon's-(Jan Merlin) lack of support; who doesn't want his daughter to go anywhere in her condition. Then, when the Ingalls girls have their own party with their friends from school, Laura exacts her revenge on Nellie. Meanwhile when Jon finds out that Charles was fitting Olga with specially adaptive shoes, he goes to the Ingalls house to confront him, and the two of them begin to physically attack each other; suddenly the fight abruptly comes to a stop when Jon tearfully sees his daughter happily playing with the other children.
