Underwater injection of Corexit into the leak may have created the oil plumes which were discovered below the surface.[142] Because the dispersants were applied at depth, much of the oil never rose to the surface.[151] One plume was 22 miles (35 km) long, more than 1 mile (1,600 m) wide and 650 feet (200 m) deep.[152] In a major study on the plume, experts were most concerned about the slow pace at which the oil was breaking down in the cold, 40 °F (4 °C) water at depths of 3,000 feet (900 m).[153]
