Wind turbines generate some noise. At a residential distance of 300 metres (980 ft) this may be around 45 dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At 1.5 km (1 mi) distance they become inaudible.[181][182] There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines.[183] Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.[184][185][186]
