In the Killings of Copenhagen episode, number five in the sixteenth series—the 100th episode[11] in all—several scenes are filmed at location in central Copenhagen, like Rådhuspladsen ("the City Hall Square"), Nyhavn ("New Port") with its canal and old colourful houses, a Danish countryside church, and at the circular square inside the Copenhagen Police Headquarters building.[12][13] The murder in Copenhagen is one of two within the entire series (until episode 114, at least) where a murder takes place outside the fictive County of Midsomer, the other being in Brighton where Inspector John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) is introduced.
