During the Miocene, three periods of volcanism marked separate events in the Sierras. Each period is marked by different volcanic processes.[55] The first was a continuation of the Oligocene flare-up, which lasted through the early Miocene. This may be a distinct second occurrence of the same process, placing silica-rich lava above Oligocene rocks.[43] Also in the early Miocene more intermediate Basaltic andesites occur along faults and in grabens.[55] Beginning in the early Miocene and continuing into the middle, an arc of andesite was placed during the spreading of the Gulf of California.[49] The basin and range-style faulting of the middle-late Miocene took place at the same time as the placement of alkali basalts,[51] In the westernmost slopes mafic dikes formed. These events have also been linked to the subduction of the Farallon Plate.[56] Episodes of volcanism continued into the Quaternary.[51]
