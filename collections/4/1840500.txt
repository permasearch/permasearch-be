A router[a] is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.  Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets.   A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.[2]
