Many people found that when Miss Emily’s father died, “at last they could pity Miss Emily.”[6] “Being left alone, and a pauper” Miss Emily was now completely alone in this new and quite foreign society.[6] She feared being alone because her father who was once always there was no longer and she didn't have a companion to fall back on after “all the young men her father had driven away.”[6]
