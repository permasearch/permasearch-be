Currently the Bulgarian National TV ( Bulgarska Natsionalna Televiziya - Българска Национална Телевизия - БНТ) and the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR - БНР) are almost entirely financed by the national budget of Bulgaria. After the fall of communism and the rise of democracy in the 90's, the topic for the financing of the public TV and Radio broadcasters was widely discussed and one of the solutions was to gather the funds by collecting user fees from all citizens. However, as the Parliament approved and included the Fee in the Radio and Television Law, the president imposed a veto on it and a public discussion of the fairness of this decision started. Critics said this is not acceptable as many people will be paying for a service they might not choose to use. The Parliament decided to keep the resolution in the law, but impose a temporary regime of financing trough the country's budget. The law has not been changed to this day and the temporary regime keeps getting prolonged and the result is - there is no fee and the funds come from the annual national budget.
