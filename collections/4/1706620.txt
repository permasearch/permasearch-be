Following standard modern academic practice, Harvard Law School refers to its Master of Laws and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees as its graduate level law degrees.[98] Similarly, Columbia refers to the LL.M. and the J.S.D. as its graduate program.[99] Yale Law School lists its LL.M., M.S.L., J.S.D., and Ph.D. as constituting graduate programs.[100] A distinction thus remains between professional and graduate law degrees in the United States.
