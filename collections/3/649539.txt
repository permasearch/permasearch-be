The key advantage of ARR is that it is easy to compute and understand. The main disadvantage of ARR is that it disregards the time factor in terms of time value of money or risks for long term investments. The ARR is built on evaluation of profits and it can be easily manipulated with changes in depreciation methods. The ARR can give misleading information when evaluating investments of different size.[3]
