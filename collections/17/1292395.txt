Because this is the period of rotation in a precessing reference frame, it is not directly related to the mean rotation rate of Earth in an inertial frame, which is given by ω = 2π/T where T is the slightly longer stellar day given by Aoki et al. as 86 7002164098903697320♠164.09890369732 s.[8] This can be calculated by noting that ω is the magnitude of the vector sum of the rotations leading to the sidereal day and the precession of that rotation vector. In fact, the period of Earth's rotation varies on hourly to interannual timescales by around 1 millisecond,[9] together with a secular increase in length of day of about 2.3 ms per century, mostly from tidal friction slowing Earth's rotation.[10]
