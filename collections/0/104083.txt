The first indication of potential crossover events in the Arrowverse occurred on The CW during the 2013â€“14 television season, when Barry Allen was introduced in the eighth episode of Arrow's second season ahead of the debut of The Flash.[8] In July 2014, it was announced that the eighth episodes of the third season of Arrow and the first season of The Flash would be a two-hour crossover event.[9] The crossover was originally planned as the seventh episodes of each series, but was pushed back due to the large amount of work needed to accomplish it.[10] In particular, the schedule coordination of trying to "jam another episode into the 23-episode schedule for each of [the] shows."[11] Marc Guggenheim, creator and executive producer on Arrow, explained that there was "no financially responsible" way of executing the crossover, with budgets being blown, long hours and the actors having to film scenes from both series on the same day.[11]
