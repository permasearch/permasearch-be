Jeremiah, Reuben, and Swede pack up all of their things and head West for August's house. They learn that Andreeson has been by and he is likely following them, but no one knows where Davy is headed. While they are stopped in a small town in North Dakota, Andreeson approaches them and Jeremiah rebukes everything the fed has to say. Swede secretly sabotages Andreeson's car and the family is able to escape from him. They travel for hours without stopping at a gas station because they are all manned with police officers looking for the Lands. Miraculously, they do not run out of fuel and they are never spotted, despite the distinct mobile home.
