After the government's plan to use the Royal prerogative (i.e., to give notice without explicit Parliamentary authority) was defeated in a court case, Parliament passed the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017, empowering the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. The notification of withdrawal by a member state starts a negotiation period that is limited to two years, unless extended with the consent of all EU member states.[315] Arising from the Act, the UK Government formally triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017.[316]
