Following the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Poland regained its independence in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles. In September 1939, World War II started with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, followed by the Soviet Union invading Poland in accordance with the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact. More than six million of Poland's citizens died in the war.[13][14] After World War II, the Polish People's Republic was established as a satellite state under Soviet influence.[15] In the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1989, most notably through the emergence of the Solidarity movement, Poland established itself as a democratic republic.
