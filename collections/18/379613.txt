Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time.[42] The album's singles, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Breaking the Habit", "Faint", and "Numb", received significant radio attention.[43] By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three million copies.[44] The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit.[21] Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones.[45] The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour.[21] In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia.[46]
