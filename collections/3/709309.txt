Privately run prisons are run under contracts which set out the standards that must be met, which in many respects mirror the Service Level Agreements which apply to publicly run prisons.[5]  Payments may be deducted for poor performance against the contract. Government monitors ("controllers") work permanently within each privately managed prison to check on conditions and treatment of prisoners.  The framework for regulation and accountability is much the same for privately run prisons as for publicly run ones. In England and Wales they are subject to unannounced inspection by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, to monitoring by local Independent Monitoring Boards and prisoner complaints are dealt with by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman.  Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
