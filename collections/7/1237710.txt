In Indonesia, high school graduates who want to enroll to public medical schools must have their names enlisted by their high school faculty in the "SNMPTN Undangan" program, arranged by Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education. Depending on the high school accreditation, only the class' top 10%-15% will be considered for admissions. Fewer places are available through entrance exam conducted autonomously by each university. These exams are highly competitive for medicine, especially in prestigious institutions such as University of Indonesia in Jakarta, Airlangga University in Surabaya, and Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta. For private medical school, almost all places are offered through independently run admission tests.
