On November 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States,[35] in reaction to Trump's election campaign and political views,[c][37] and his defeat of female presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Teresa Shook of Hawaii created a Facebook event and invited friends to march on Washington in protest.[4][38][39] Similar Facebook pages created by Evvie Harmon, Fontaine Pearson, Bob Bland (a New York fashion designer), Breanne Butler, and others quickly led to thousands of women signing up to march.[40][41][42][43] Harmon, Pearson, and Butler decided to unite their efforts and consolidate their pages, beginning the official Women's March on Washington.[40] To ensure that the march was led by women of differing races and backgrounds, Vanessa Wruble, co-founder, and co-president of Okayafrica, served as Head of Campaign Operations and brought on Tamika D. Mallory, Carmen Perez and Linda Sarsour to serve as National Co-Chairs alongside Bland.[40][44][5] Former Miss New Jersey USA Janaye Ingram served as Head of Logistics.[45] Filmmaker Paola Mendoza served as Artistic Director and a National Organizer.[46][47]
