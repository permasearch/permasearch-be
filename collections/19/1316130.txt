In the early 1970s, the Yuzpe regimen was developed by A. Albert Yuzpe in 1974;[80] progestin-only postcoital contraception was investigated (1975);[81] and the copper IUD was first studied for use as emergency contraception (1975).[82] Danazol was tested in the early 1980s in the hopes that it would have fewer side effects than Yuzpe, but was found to be ineffective.[83]
