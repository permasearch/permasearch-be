Some qualitative studies show the improved profitability and sustainability of holistically managed operations and the efficacy of Holistic Management as a whole farm/ranch planning tool. In particular, Dr. Deborah Stinner, Dr. Benjamin Stinner of (Ohio State University at Wooster), and Ed Marsolf wrote an article about Holistic Management and how biodiversity is an organizing principle in agroecosystem management. Another was done by Charley Orchard as he surveyed ranchers in the Northern Rockies and the results they had achieved.
