The minimum temperature that will kill eggs was estimated by South Korean researchers to be between −3.4 °C and −12.7 °C on the basis of mean daily temperatures during their winter of 2009/2010.[7] This estimate contrasts with eggs having survived the much colder winter 2013/14 temperatures in Pennsylvania, United States.[8]
