The X5 received a mid-generational refresh (LCI update) for the 2011 model year featuring new front bumper and air intakes as well as a variety of minor cosmetic changes. For the gasoline-powered X5 models, the naturally aspirated engines in the xDrive30i and xDrive48i (N52 I-6 and N62 V8) were replaced by turbocharged engines (N55 single-turbo straight-6, N63 twin-turbo V8) and which will also be mated to 8-speed automatic transmissions,[9] being rebadged as the xDrive35i and xDrive50i, respectively. The xDrive35d received the same exterior changes as the rest of the lineup but otherwise no other updates.[10]
