After two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the tail end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to move The Magical World of Disney off of broadcast television and began airing the anthology on The Disney Channel – in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade – starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since The Disney Channel operated as a premium channel at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. The Magical World of Disney originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5½ years; however in September 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, The Disney Channel expanded the Magical World brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday prime-time film block, maintaining its 7:00 p.m. Eastern time slot.
