Emma was written after the publication of Pride and Prejudice and was submitted to the London publisher John Murray II in the fall of 1815. He offered Austen £450 for this plus the copyrights of Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility, which she refused. Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray. The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three volume set at the selling price of £1.1s per set.[7]
