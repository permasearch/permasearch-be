In Switzerland, Anna pretends to be a patient in order to snoop around in hopes of finding Robin. Luke later arrives to help her search, but they don't find her, and decide to return to Port Charles. Luke later tells Anna about the lies he told Robert, and she isn't able to forgive him. Later, Anna's presumed deceased, ex-husband, Duke Lavery, shows up and wants to get back together with her. Initially skeptical, Duke is able to convince Anna that it is the real him, and they grow closer. Later Faison, who is obsessed with Anna shows up and it is discovered he has been wearing a mask so that he can act and look like Duke to try and win Anna's heart. Faison pretends to be Duke for a time and Anna begins to not only believe that he is Duke, but that Duke is falling madly in love with her all over again. Just when Anna thinks she too is falling back in love with Duke, Anna begins to question the true identity of Duke/Faison.
