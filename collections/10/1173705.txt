For the 1983 model year, Ford introduced the Ford Ranger for the United States and Canada. Replacing the 1971-1982 Ford Courier (a rebadged Mazda B-Series), the Ranger was the first compact pickup truck designed by Ford Motor Company. In 1995, exports of the Ford Ranger began in select Latin and South American countries. To accommodate the demand for the vehicle, in 1998, Ford Argentina commenced local production of the Ranger, introducing a four-door cab not sold in North America.
