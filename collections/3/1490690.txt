The Principles of Psychology is an 1890 book about psychology by William James, an American philosopher and psychologist who trained to be a physician before going into psychology. There are four methods from James' book: stream of consciousness (James' most famous psychological metaphor); emotion (later known as the Jamesâ€“Lange theory); habit (human habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results); and will (through James' personal experiences in life).
