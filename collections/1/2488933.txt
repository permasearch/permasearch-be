Julie's mother Lisa sets up a pre-party for the parents and kids. Mitchell, Kayla's father, greets Lisa, and notes that she has been evading his attempts to catch up. Sam's free-spirited father Hunter, divorced from her mother after his infidelity, arrives in a limousine for the girls, and pledges to make this night the best of her life. The girls head to the prom, and text each other about their sex pact; back home, Mitchell and Lisa hear Julie's still-open laptop and intercept the messages. Hunter helps them decipher the emoji codes, and they realize about the girls' pact. Lisa and Mitchell rush to "cock block" their daughters, and Hunter tries to stop them. Hunter shares his intuition that Sam is gay, and that Chad is a beard, but at the first party, he sees her force herself to kiss Chad. Wanting to protect his daughter from making a mistake, he joins Lisa and Mitchell's crusade.
