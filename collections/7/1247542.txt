Andy Fairfax (voiced by Diedrich Bader) is a bat who is involved in trickery, particularly to sell things. In the episode “Get Off My Lawn,” he slyly sells all the lemurs in the kingdom protection scorpions, leaving Clover without a job. He is seen in many episodes selling things to unknowing people, like a comfort Mort in “Julien 2.0.” He and Pancho are often seen together robbing houses, as seen in “The All Hail King Julien Show.” Often he uses his charming personality to fool others. Apparently he and Pancho met at a summer camp for grown-ups that lasted for 3-5 years.
