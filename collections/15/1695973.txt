Many video games have included cold opens. These either begin with a lengthy opening sequence or, like Grand Theft Auto V or the Metal Gear Solid games, include an entire level before the titles. It is common in Japanese RPGs, with the original Final Fantasy an early example. Both Wild Arms and Kingdom Hearts II went as far as including an entire subplot, often taking upwards of three hours to play through, before showing the game's logo.
