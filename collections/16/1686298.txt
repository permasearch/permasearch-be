In 2015, the Russian economy was the sixth largest in the world by PPP and twelfth largest at market exchange rates. Between 2000 and 2012 Russia's energy exports fueled a rapid growth in living standards, with real disposable income rising by 160%.[38] In dollar-denominated terms this amounted to a more than sevenfold increase in disposable incomes since 2000.[39] In the same period, unemployment and poverty more than halved and Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction also rose significantly.[40] This growth was a combined result of the 2000s commodities boom, high oil prices, as well as prudent economic and fiscal policies.[41] However, these gains have been distributed unevenly, as the 110 wealthiest individuals were found in a report by Credit Suisse to own 35% of all financial assets held by Russian households.[42][43] Russia also has the second-largest volume of illicit money outflows, having lost over $880 billion between 2002 and 2011 in this way.[44] Since 2008 Forbes has repeatedly named Moscow the "billionaire capital of the world".[45]
