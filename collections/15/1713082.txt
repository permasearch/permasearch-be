The Bullhead City area is home to four public libraries:  Two Mohave County Libraries (Bullhead City and Fort Mohave),[51][52] one Clark County Library[53] (Laughlin) and one San Bernardino County Library (Needles).[54]  Bullhead City's library recently reopened after a major expansion to include a teen section, children section, 11,000 sq. ft. adult section, public computers, sound-proof rooms, and conference rooms for the community.  The new "green" building was partially paid for by an environmental grant.  Its innovative design comes from architect Will Bruder, which features energy saving technologies and special skylights that take advantage of the desert sun.[55][56]
