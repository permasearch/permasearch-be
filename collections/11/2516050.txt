The Smashing Pumpkins recorded a cover of the song and released it as a b-side on their 1994 CD single "Rocket". Frontman Billy Corgan was introduced to the band by bassist D'arcy Wretzky, who is a longtime fan of Depeche Mode and requested the band cover the song. During their 1998 concert in Los Angeles, Depeche Mode invited Corgan, their opening act, onstage to perform the song together. This version of the song is also featured on the soundtrack for Not Another Teen Movie (in the soundtrack of the movie, another cover of a Depeche Mode song appears: "But Not Tonight", this one covered by Stone Temple Pilots's Scott Weiland).[citation needed]
