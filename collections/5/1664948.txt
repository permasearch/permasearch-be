V  max     {\displaystyle V_{\max }}   remains the same because the presence of the inhibitor can be overcome by higher substrate concentrations.      K  m   app     {\displaystyle K_{m}^{\text{app}}}  , the substrate concentration that is needed to reach      V  max    /  2   {\displaystyle V_{\max }/2}  , increases with the presence of a competitive inhibitor. This is because the concentration of substrate needed to reach      V  max     {\displaystyle V_{\max }}   with an inhibitor is greater than the concentration of substrate needed to reach      V  max     {\displaystyle V_{\max }}   without an inhibitor.
