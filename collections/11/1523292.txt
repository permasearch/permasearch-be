The conference has come under severe media scrutiny for its poor officiating over the past several years. They had so much scrutiny for biased officiating that the commissioner put an end to all contact and complaint forms. Thus, trying to silence the same people that made him a multi-millionaire. The conference has also been scrutinized for continuing to keep its home office just minutes away from the University of Alabamaâ€™s campus with many graduates working for the conference, including as officials on football field.
