Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[48] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[49] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films.[48] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[29][42] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[50] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[51] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[52] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[53] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[54] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energyÂ ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[55]
