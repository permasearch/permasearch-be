Lead-ions (Pb2+), like magnesium-ions (Mg2+), blocks NMDA receptors. Since the normal Pb2+ concentration in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120Â mg[a]), even a low increase in Pb2+ concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors.[153] Therefore, an increase in Pb2+ concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP.[154] The targeting of NMDA receptors is thought to be one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.[149]
