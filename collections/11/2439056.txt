The Detour was a choice between Boil and Build. In Boil, teams would have to fill a Russian outdoor bathing kettle with water until it reached the marked line and also use wood and paper scraps to light a fire underneath it. Once the kettle was full, and the fire was going, teams had to submerge themselves in the icy water before receiving their next clue. In Build, teams would have to stack all of the provided firewood, following the traditional method. Their stack had to fill the marked area. Once their stack was complete, teams would get their next clue.
