According to Exodus, Shabbat (Sabbath) was reinstituted the first week manna appeared.[46] It states that twice as much manna as usual was available on the sixth morning of the week, and none at all could be found on the seventh day;[47] although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night,[9] that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night.[48] Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat;[46] and that God instructed him that no one should leave his place on Shabbat,[49] so that the people could rest during it.[50]
