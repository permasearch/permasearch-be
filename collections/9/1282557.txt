In 2013, Yahoo redesigned the site and removed several features, such as simultaneously opening multiple emails in tabs, sorting by sender name, and dragging mails to folders.[25][26] The new email interface was geared to give an improved user-experience for mobile devices, but was criticized for having an inferior desktop interface.[citation needed] Many users objected to the unannounced nature of the changes through an online post asking Yahoo to bring back mail tabs with one hundred thousand voting and nearly ten thousand commenting.[27] The redesign produced a problem that caused an unknown number of users to lose access to their accounts for several weeks.[28]
