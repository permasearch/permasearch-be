The NFL Draft has become one of the key events on the American football calendar, airing live on television each April. In recent years it had been held at New York's Radio City Music Hall, but in 2015 and 2016 it was held at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre,[4] and in 2017 it was held on the Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The 2018 draft is the first ever to be held at an NFL stadium, namely the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium.
