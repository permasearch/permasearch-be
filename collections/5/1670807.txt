The end of the Papal States in the middle of the "Italian boot" around the central area of Rome was not the only important event in the long pontificate of Pius. His leadership of the Church contributed to an ever-increasing centralization and consolidation of power in Rome and the papacy. While his political views and policies were hotly debated, his personal life style was above any criticism; he was considered a model of simplicity and poverty in his every day affairs.[16] More than his predecessors, Pius used the papal pulpit to address the bishops of the world. The First Vatican Council (1869â€“1870), which he convened to consolidate papal authority further, was considered a milestone not only in his pontificate but also for Church history through its defining of the dogma of papal infallibility.[17]
