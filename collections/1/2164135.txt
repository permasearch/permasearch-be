Charbroilers are energy intensive, and commonly use 15,000 to 30,000 BTU of gas per burner, per hour. Small units (four burners) will utilize 60,000 to 120,000 BTU/hr (approximately 0.6 – 1.2 therms of natural gas) and larger units with up to 13 burners can use 195,000 to 390,000 BTU/hr (approximately 2 – 4 therms of natural gas). The average cost of a therm (100 cubic feet) of natural gas is approximately $1.00 (including taxes and fees, though costs vary by region and over time),[9] which translates into energy costs between $6 and $40 per day for a single unit operating for 10 hours.
