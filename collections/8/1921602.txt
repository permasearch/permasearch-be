England's mixed fortunes continued under Gooch's successor Mike Atherton. Earmarked early as a future captain, England enjoyed victories over South Africa, India and New Zealand under his premiership although they continued to fare badly against the West Indies and Australia, and the lack of consistent progress led to his resignation at the end of the 1997/98 tour of the West Indies, which England lost 3-1. Replacement Alec Stewart was sacked after less than a year in the job after another defeat in Australia and a disastrous 1999 Cricket World Cup campaign. The beginning of Nasser Hussain's captaincy saw England jeered by their own supporters after losing to New Zealand at home in 1999, but England soon started to enjoy a revival, which continued under Michael Vaughan. England were the only team undefeated in 2004, and were, as at June 2005, ranked as the second-best Test nation in the world. Later that summer they regained The Ashes from Australia, having not held them since 1989.
