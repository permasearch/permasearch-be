Plotting revenge against the group, Dean Pritchard tries to get the student council president, Megan Huang, to revoke the fraternity's charter. Megan, who met her boyfriend at one of their parties, initially remains loyal to the fraternity until the dean bribes her with promises to help her get into Columbia Law School. By video, he claims that the group is violating university policies, subjecting the students in the non-sanctioned fraternity to expulsion. Mitch finds out that the group has the right to bypass the dean's ruling if all of their members complete activities that include academic tests, public debates and athletics to prove their legitimacy.
