Jemaine takes Bret and Murray to see his new apartment.  It turns out to be an empty cleaning cupboard, which Murray dubs a "compartment".  When Jemaine announces he has to leave on a date, Bret quickly works out that it is with Sally.  A jealous Bret takes Coco on a date to the same restaurant to which Jemaine has taken Sally.  After dinner we learn that Sally is having a birthday party which happens to conflict with Jemaine's housewarming.
