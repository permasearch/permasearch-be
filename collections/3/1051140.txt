The Silent Hill series uses symbolism and psychology; the town of Silent Hill draws upon the psyche of its visitors, ultimately creating an "otherworld," a twisting of reality that manifests delusions and elements of their subconscious minds, varying from character to character.[33] Specifically, in the case of Silent Hill 2's primary player character James Sunderland, the version of the town he explores is influenced by him. Many of the monsters that roam the town symbolize his guilt, wish for punishment, for his wife's three-year-long illness,[33] and cease to exist after James comes to terms with the fact that he killed his wife Mary, partially to end her suffering and partially out of resentment and frustration.[33][34] James knew she had a terminal illness,[35] which has been speculated to be cancer,[36] and he often read medical textbooks, searching for something to help her.[37] During her last days alive, she became physically repulsive as a result of the illness and treated James abusively, ordering him to leave one moment and begging him to comfort her the next.[38] The knowledge of her terminal illness caused her to become angry and to hurt her loved ones, particularly James, and it pained him to visit her in the hospital.[39] Pyramid Head functions as an executioner of Maria, a delusion of James' who strongly resembles Mary.[40] Through Maria's repeated deaths, Pyramid Head reminds James of Mary's death and causes him to experience guilt and suffering.[14][41] His appearance as an executioner stems from a picture that James saw while visiting the town three years ago with Mary.[41]
