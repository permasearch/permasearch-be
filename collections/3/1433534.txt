In 1862 Thames Ironworks on the River Thames built the iron-hulled sister ships SS Yavari and SS Yapura under contract to the James Watt Foundry of Birmingham.[51] The ships were designed as combined cargo, passenger and gunboats for the Peruvian Navy.[51] After several years' delay in delivery from the Pacific coast to the lake, Yavari was launched in 1870 and Yapura in 1873.[51] Yavari was 30 metres (100Â ft) long but in 1914 her hull was lengthened for extra cargo capacity and she was re-engined as a motor vessel.[51] During the last days of the War of the Pacific Chile was sending a warship on railroad to Titicaca Lake in order to disrupt trade.[52]
