Ruler of the Snake Men, King Hiss can shed his human-like "skin" to become a twisting mass of five snakes from the waist up.[51] In the 2002 series, The Sorceress describes King Hiss as wielding magic as great of that of the Elders. King Hiss was defeated by Hordak and his minions in the times of King Grayskull. Ages later, King Hiss and his henchmen were sealed away beneath Snake Mountain (which King Hiss built) by Zodak, to be released during the reign of King Randor by Kobra Khan, General Rattlor, and Evil-Lyn. In the unproduced Episode 40 of the 2002 series, his name is spelled "King Hsss." The new 2002 version is his belated cartoon appearance as he never appeared in the original 1980s cartoon as it ceased production by the time Mattel released his figure.
