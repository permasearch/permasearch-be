One man, Wesley MacIntire, survived the fall when his Ford Courier pickup truck landed on the deck of the Summit Venture before falling into the bay. He sued the company that owned the ship, and settled for $175,000 in 1984.[16] MacIntire would be the last person to drive on the original southbound span.[citation needed] The pilot of the ship, John Lerro, was cleared of wrongdoing by both a state grand jury and a Coast Guard investigation.[17]
