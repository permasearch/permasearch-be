"All Through the Night" is a song written and originally recorded in 1983 by American singer-songwriter Jules Shear, though it is best known for the hit single version recorded by Cyndi Lauper later that same year.  It is included on Lauper's debut album She's So Unusual. Shear wrote "All Through The Night" as a mid-tempo folk-rock song for his 1983 album Watch Dog. After the Cars recorded their own version, which they did not use on any of their albums, Lauper decided to cover it. Although she initially intended to do a straight cover of Shear's version, she turned it into a pop ballad instead.
