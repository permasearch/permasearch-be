Andrew Trendell of NME regarded the song as an "anthemic showcase of Ezra's songcraftsmanship" and the "cathartic ode to being honest about how you're really feeling".[1] Gabriel Aikins of Substream Magazine wrote that the song "combines Ezra's trademark acoustic guitar with horns on a track about letting go of the things that don't matter to more fully enjoy life".[6] Kirstie Sutherland of Redbrick wrote: 'Don't Matter Now' is typical George â€“ happy-go-lucky, care-free and just really bloody lovely."[11] Heather Carrick pf The National Student wrote: "George's famously low vocals blend seamlessly into the mid-tempo melody, backed up by an old timey trumpet-infused backing track creating a chilled-out, seaside-inspired song."[4]
