In Northern Ireland, four commercial banks are authorised to issue their own sterling banknotes: Ulster Bank, Danske Bank (formerly Northern Bank), First Trust Bank and Bank of Ireland. Of these, only banknotes issued by Danske Bank and Ulster Bank feature portraits of real people, with First Trust's notes depicting generic "Irish citizens" and Bank of Ireland notes showing buildings.
