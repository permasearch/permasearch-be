In a letter to Henri Basnage, held at the University of Basel Public Library, dated 30 March 1697, Johann Bernoulli stated that he had found 2 methods (always referred to as 'direct' and 'indirect') to show that the Brachistochrone was the ‘common cycloid’, also called the ‘roulette‘. Following advice from Leibniz, he only included the indirect method in the Acta Eruditorum Lipsidae of May 1697. He writes that this is partly because he believed it was sufficient to convince anyone who doubted the conclusion, partly because it also resolved 2 famous problems in optics which ‘the late Mr. Huygens’ had raised in his treatise on Light. In the same letter he criticises Newton for concealing his method.
