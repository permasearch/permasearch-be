About 2.6 million Cubans, a fourth of the population, were evacuated ahead of Ike.[66] In Baracoa, 200 homes were reported to be destroyed and waves were running 23 ft (7 m) high and peaked at 40 ft (12 m) in different areas of Cuba. The Category 4 hurricane made landfall on September 8 on the north coast of eastern Cuba in the province of Holguín near Puerto de Sama, with sustained winds of about 130 mph (209 km/h),[2] causing widespread flooding and damage to the eastern provinces.[2] It passed across the central provinces of Holguín, Las Tunas, and Camagüey, emerging over the sea to the south of Cuba during the day. Ike dropped to Category One intensity by the time it crossed the island.[67] It then followed the southern coast of Cuba and crossed the western end of the island in Pinar del Río Province, close to the path taken by Hurricane Gustav ten days previously. The western areas of Cuba, already devastated by just 10 days before Ike hit, suffered additional major flooding from the rain and storm surge.[1] The sugar cane crop was devastated, with over 3,400 square kilometres (1,300 sq mi) destroyed. The banana, yucca, coffee and corn crop also suffered significant damage.[2] Alongside Gustav, they were described as the "worst ever" storms by Cuban officials.[68]
