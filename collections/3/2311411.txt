The best-known song on this album is probably the Burt Bacharach composition that was used as the title theme for the 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale.  According to liner notes in the Shout!Factory CD, the song was originally recorded with a vocal, but Bacharach was dissatisfied with the recording. He sent the tapes to Herb Alpert, who overdubbed some trumpets and some Tijuana Brass instruments (most prominently marimba and percussion) and sent the song back to Bacharach.  This version, with the Bacharach orchestra rather than the Brass members providing most of the backing, is the one included on the Sounds Like album.
