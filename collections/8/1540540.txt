First published in the relatively genteel Southern Literary Messenger[9] in March 1835. Many readers were shocked by the violence in "Berenice" and complained to publisher Thomas W. White,[10] leading to an edited version eventually being published in 1840. The four removed paragraphs describe a scene where Egaeus visits Berenice before her burial and clearly sees that she is still alive as she moves her finger and smiles.
