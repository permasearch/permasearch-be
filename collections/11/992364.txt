In Dead Man's Chest, it is revealed that Sparrow once made a deal with Davy Jones.[2] Jones raised the Black Pearl from the sea in exchange for a guarantee of service as a crewman on the Flying Dutchman. When Jones attempts to collect on the bargain, Sparrow flees. He attempts to find the Dead Man's Chest, which contains Jones's heart; this would give Sparrow leverage over Jones. At the end of the film, Sparrow is betrayed by Elizabeth Swann and dragged to Davy Jones's Locker by the Kraken.
