Using Sylvester's criterion (checking whether the diagonal elements are all positive), and since diagonal components        I    a , a     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{a,a}}   and        I    c , c     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{c,c}}   have singularities at α=2 and β=2 it follows that the Fisher information matrix for the four parameter case is positive-definite for α>2 and β>2. Since for α > 2 and β > 2 the beta distribution is (symmetric or unsymmetric) bell shaped, it follows that the Fisher information matrix is positive-definite only for bell-shaped (symmetric or unsymmetric) beta distributions, with inflection points located to either side of the mode. Thus, important well known distributions belonging to the four-parameter beta distribution family, like the parabolic distribution (Beta(2,2,a,c)) and the uniform distribution (Beta(1,1,a,c)) have Fisher information components (       I    a , a   ,    I    c , c   ,    I    α , a   ,    I    β , c     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}_{a,a},{\mathcal {I}}_{c,c},{\mathcal {I}}_{\alpha ,a},{\mathcal {I}}_{\beta ,c}}  ) that blow up (approach infinity) in the four-parameter case (although their Fisher information components are all defined for the two parameter case). The four-parameter Wigner semicircle distribution (Beta(3/2,3/2,a,c)) and arcsine distribution (Beta(1/2,1/2,a,c)) have negative Fisher information determinants for the four-parameter case.
