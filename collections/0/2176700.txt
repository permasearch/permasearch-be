As time went on, the North Korean government became more aggressive, and skirmishes between troops of the North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating.[6] United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal.[4][discuss] For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.[2]
