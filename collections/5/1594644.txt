The rivalries between the datus, rajahs, sultans, and lakans eventually eased Spanish colonization. Furthermore, the islands were sparsely populated[87] due to consistent natural disasters[88] and inter-kingdom conflicts. Therefore, colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the Spanish Empire and were Hispanicized and Christianized.[89]
