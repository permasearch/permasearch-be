During flooding upstream and downstream in the early months of 2014 some Ham Island (in Old Windsor) and Wraysbury residents said that the Jubilee River increased the height of the flooded Thames in much of those villages, which along with much of the river upstream of London saw water levels unprecedented since 1947. Wraysbury had also suffered significant flooding in 2003.[4] The Environment Agency in the 2010s is undertaking a widening and dredging programme of Thames works to assist with downstream flows.[11][12]
