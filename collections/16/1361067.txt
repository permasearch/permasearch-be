When the Curule Aedileship had been created, it had only been opened to Patricians.[29] Eventually, however, Plebeians won full admission to the Curule Aedileship. In addition, after the Consulship had been opened to the Plebeians, the Plebeians acquired a de facto right to hold both the Roman Dictatorship and the Roman Censorship (which had been created in 443 BC)[15] since only former Consuls could hold either office. 356 BC saw the appointment of the first Plebeian Dictator,[30] and in 339 BC the Plebeians facilitated the passage of a law (the lex Publilia), which required the election of at least one Plebeian Censor for each five-year term.[30] In 337 BC, the first Plebeian Praetor was elected.[30]
