In South Australian pubs and clubs, the term "schooner" refers to a glass with a capacity of 285 mL (known as a "pot" elsewhere in Australia, and a "middy" in New South Wales and Western Australia 10 imp. fl. oz., or half an imperial pint, pre-metrication). In other Australian states "schooner" traditionally refers to a glass of 425 mL (15 imp. fl. oz., or three-quarters of an imperial pint, pre-metrication). It is the most common size in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory, although not unknown in other states. Some hospitality venues in Western Australia are going through a process of "schoonerification", whereby the previous culture of drinking by pints has been changed with vessels of schooner size to allay increasing costs to venues and with encouragement from the state government to curb binge drinking.
