Aided by the Magic Council's treacherous Chairman Crawford Theme, Tartaros assassinates most of the council's members to detonate the cross-continental Face bombs and neutralize Fiore's magic, thereby allowing E.N.D.'s resurrection. Their operation is interrupted by Acnologia, which brings the dragon slayers' guardians out of hiding to combat him, destroying the Faces in the process. In the meantime, Mard Geer is defeated by Natsu Dragneel and Gray Fullbuster. Zeref arrives shortly afterward to kill him for his failure and to retrieve E.N.D.'s book.
