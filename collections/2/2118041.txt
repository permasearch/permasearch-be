In mid-August, 1993, Armenians massed a force to take the Azeri regions of Fizuli and Jebrail, south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ã‡iller responded by sending thousands of Turkish troops to the border and demanding that Armenia pull out of Azerbaijan's territories.[citation needed] Russian Federation forces in Armenia however countered their movements and thus warded off any possibility that Turkey might play a military role in the conflict.[citation needed]
