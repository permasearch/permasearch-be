The DNA of a cell is vulnerable to the damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as byproducts of cellular metabolism.  DNA damage occurring in oocytes, if not repaired, can be lethal and result in reduced fecundity and loss of potential progeny.  Oocytes are substantially larger than the average somatic cell, and thus considerable metabolic activity is necessary for their provisioning.  If this metabolic activity were carried out by the oocyte’s own metabolic machinery, the oocyte genome would be exposed to the reactive oxidative by-products generated.  Thus it appears that a process evolved to avoid this vulnerability of germ line DNA.  It was proposed that, in order to avoid damage to the DNA genome of the oocytes, the metabolism contributing to the synthesis of much of the oocyte’s constituents was shifted to other maternal cells that then transferred these constituents to oocytes.[4][5]  Thus, oocytes of many organisms are protected from oxidative DNA damage while storing up a large mass of substances to nurture the zygote in its initial embryonic growth.
