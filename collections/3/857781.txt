Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised Sinon's role in Sword Art Online II, describing her as "easily the deepest character to come out of Sword Art Online".[25] Likewise, Carly Smith of The Escapist found Sinon to be a "breath of fresh air" in a show like Sword Art Online, which could have "ended after its first arc, halfway through the first season."[26] In reviewing the second episode of the Sword Art Online II anime, Salvador GRodiles of Japanator.com wrote that "Sinon isn't a pushover in battle" and is also "a force to be reckoned with",[27] and found her character to be enjoyable.[28] In concluding his review of Sword Art Online II, Sinon's character and story were praised again, writing "Overall, A-1 were able to wrap up Sword Art Online II's Phantom Bullet nicely. We got to see Shino slowly recover from her trauma and the show did a decent job in explaining the process behind Shinkawa and his older brother's evil scheme â€“ even if their scheme had some far-fetched elements. To top it all off, they were able set things up for the next big storyline in the series."[29]
