Due to the fact that during the time as a federal penitentiary no inmates were ever permanently held here, A-Block was never modernized, so retained its "flat strap-iron bars, key locks and spiral staircases" from the original military prison.[73]  Several inmates, however, were held briefly in A-Block before a hearing or transfer.[73] In the later years of the state penitentiary, the A-Block was mainly used for extra storage and a law library was installed here at one point and it was a place where inmates could type legal documents.[73] A small barber's shop was located at the end of A-block where inmates would have  a monthly haircut.[73]
