A recent production of By the Bog of Cats premiered at Chicago's Artistic Home Theater on February 15th and ran through April 15th. The production received a rating of 3 stars from reviewer Kerry Reid. Reid noted that Carr's plays are produced "stateside far less" than other Irish playwrights, despite a "long-running relationship with Dublin's celebrated Abbey Theatre, which has served as a pipeline for Irish dramatists to American stages for decades." [9] Reid contends that the play has not been produced locally since the defunct Irish Repertory of Chicago produced it in 2001.[9]
