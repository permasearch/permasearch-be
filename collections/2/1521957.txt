In the Soviet Union, the outcome of the game was heralded and the players celebrated as heroes, with comparatively little attention given to the controversy surrounding the team's victory.[34]  When asked about the subject, Soviet team members have indicated that they view their triumph as having been achieved legitimately.[34]  Edeshko and Sergei Belov, in particular, have been critical of the Americans for refusing to accept having lost,[6][35] with Edeshko saying that he regrets that others may feel the Soviets' gold medals were undeserved, but that he harbors no such doubts himself.[34]  From his perspective as coach, Kondrashin acknowledged that the controversy did somewhat diminish his enjoyment of the triumph.  However, he still cited the victory as the greatest accomplishment of his basketball career.[14]
