The match had the most yellow cards awarded in a World Cup final, more than doubling the previous record for a final, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986.[8] Fourteen yellow cards were awarded (nine for the Netherlands and five for Spain),[8] and John Heitinga of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. One yellow card was for Nigel de Jong's studs-up kick to the chest of Xabi Alonso during the first half, for which Rob Hughes of The New York Times, among others, believed the referee should have given a red card.[9] The referee, Howard Webb, later said after reviewing the foul that it should have been a red card, but that his view during play was partially obstructed.[10]
