Driving through Frankfort, Jackson traveled to a trailer park, got out of the car, and approached a trailer where a woman and her three-year-old son lived. Once inside, Jackson abducted the two and drove off in the woman’s car. He traveled for approximately ten minutes and stopped the car on a country road. After stealing the woman’s money and rings she was wearing, he drove off.
