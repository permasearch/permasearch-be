BART is SFO's connection to Caltrain at the Millbrae Station, which requires a transfer at the San Bruno station during most of BART's weekday operating hours; direct BART service between SFO and Millbrae is available on weekday evenings, weekends, and holidays.[159] Caltrain used to offer a free shuttle to SFO airport from the Millbrae station,[160] but it was replaced by BART service when the SFO extension was completed.
