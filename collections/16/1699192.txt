Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[100] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, "Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon."[96] To that end, her 2001â€“02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.
