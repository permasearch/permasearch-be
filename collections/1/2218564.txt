Winston effectively retired as an actress in 1993, partly because of a broken elbow which incapacitated her for a year but mainly because she started a family and wished to devote her time to raising her two daughters. Her husband is Bob Yannetti, an assistant TV director. She turned to the less demanding role of looping and has worked on shows like Ally McBeal and Boston Legal.[4] Her husband worked as director on some episodes of the latter.[3]
