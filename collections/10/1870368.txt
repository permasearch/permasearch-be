Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly proclaimed that although "Lucious was forced to be the single parent, he did it badly, wounding his three sons in myriad ways while he chased worldly significance." Despite castigating Lucious for being a bad parent, Jensen thought that the character had depth to him due to Howard's impressive portrayal, saying that "Lucious may as well have been an absent dad, though in truth, heâ€™s just like too many so-called present fathers, distracted and remote. Howard effortlessly embodies the character's hypocrisies and imbues him with a palpable emotional life without sanding off his alienating edge."[60]
