At Mulhouse, Wenger was managed by Paul Frantz, who also had a profound impact on his career. It was he who formalised Wenger's beliefs on the importance of nutrition, isometrics and working on a player's strong points.[31] Wenger played in midfield for Mulhouse, often positioned on the right. In their final game of the 1974â€“75 season, the club beat AS Nancy to avoid relegation, but shortly afterwards, Frantz resigned.[32] Wenger also made the decision to leave, as the regular commutes to Mulhouse from Strasbourg overwhelmed him.[32] In 1975, he rekindled his friendship with Hild and signed for amateur club ASPV Strasbourg (Vauban).[32] Hild needed a midfielder "who could organise play and also have a sort of hold over the team" and decided to recruit Wenger.[32] Vauban was formed in 1971 and made steady progress up the French football league system thereafter; Wenger's three seasons at the club culminated with promotion to the third division.[33]
