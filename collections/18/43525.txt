Service: In addition to the regular customers, the night's patrons included a group of sumo wrestlers, both of whom ordered one of everything on the menu; Ramsay split it down the middle between the kitchens. The teams enjoyed a strong start on appetizers fueled by Giovanni and LA's risottos, while Lacey surprisingly emerged as a leader on the blue team, but the meat station was a wreck on both sides: J undercooked his beef Wellingtons because the oven fan was on low, sent raw chicken to the pass and then forgot an order of lamb on a later ticket. In the red kitchen Ramsay discovered a stash of discarded burnt beef wellingtons hidden underneath Andrea's station; Andrea then became overwhelmed and stalled the red kitchen's progress. Robert wasted a lot of food while prepping his dishes, and angered Ramsay further by not responding when Ramsay repeatedly addressed him as "Bobby," for which Robert mooned the confessional room camera during an interview while telling Ramsay to "kiss my ass." The final straw was when Colleen's pear dessert was returned because both the pear and the pastry were raw. With service a lost cause and Ramsay refusing any more returned dishes from Jean-Philippe, the kitchen was closed, with Ramsay calling it the worst performance so far. In a private meeting after the service, Robert explained that he did not respond to "Bobby" because that was the name of his abusive father and that it brought back painful memories from his childhood. Ramsay apologized and replied that he would respect Robert's wishes, adding that it would not have happened had he known about it beforehand. Giovanni and LA were selected as the best of the worst for their teams and were tasked with choosing a person for elimination, though Lacey was also singled out for praise for her leadership and strong performance.
