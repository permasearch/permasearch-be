The Art & Home Center is home to a recently renovated demonstration kitchen, which has been the host of several celebrity cooking demonstrations by such notable chefs as Adam Richman, Bobby Flay, and Mario Batali. The Art & Home Center is the hub of all culinary, art, and craft exhibitions with New York's artists displaying their work in fine arts, photography, woodworking, quilting, and needle work.[31] Each year, the Art & Home Center hosts its annual Womenâ€™s Day Luncheon. In 2009, the building celebrated its 75th anniversary by celebrating the life of suffragette Harriet May Mills, whom the building is dedicated to.[34]  The building also hosts a display of operating model trains and circus trains during each year's fair.  In 1966 the Empire State Theatre & Musical Instrument Museum[35] was established featuring an extensive collection of pianos, organs, phonographs, vintage motion picture projectors, and movie palace artifacts, many of which are on permanent display.
