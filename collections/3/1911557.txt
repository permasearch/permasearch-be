"Bend It!" was a big hit in Europe, including a Number One in Germany. To obtain a bouzouki sound on the recording, an electrified mandolin was used. The song was inspired by music from the film sound track of Zorba The Greek. The combined UK and European sales were over one million.[7] However, in October 1966, the British music magazine NME commented that dozens of US radio stations had banned the record, because the lyrics were considered too suggestive. The group responded by recording a new version in London with a different set of words, which was rush-released in the US, as the original single was withdrawn from sale.[2] "Bend It!" was later used in an episode of the American animated sitcom Futurama entitled "The Mutants Are Revolting".
