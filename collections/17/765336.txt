Capital punishment is a legal penalty in Singapore. The city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1998, estimated by the United Nations to be 13.83 executions annually per one million people during that period.[1] The highest was Turkmenistan (now an abolitionist country) with 14.92. However, since the 2010s, execution has become far less common, with some years having no executions at all. No one was executed in 2012 and 2013, and two persons were executed in 2014. Each execution in Singapore is carried out by long drop hanging in Changi Prison at dawn on Friday, except once on 20 May 2016 when the execution of Kho Jabing was carried out at 3:30Â pm after his appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed that morning.[2] In a survey done in 2005, reported in The Straits Times, 95% of Singaporeans believe that their country should retain the death penalty.[3]
