After falling pregnant by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) gave birth to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies.[31] Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then went in search of her biological parents. Brett did not want to know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), came to visit and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.[31]
