One of the most potent realizations of Ginn's fascination with the avant-garde, Weeding Out is described by critic Chris True of Allmusic as "an interesting document of Greg Ginn's development from high-speed guitar 'sculptor' to one of the few punk artists to embrace 12-tone experimental music." Like Family Man, the album is highly regarded by fans of free jazz and experimental metal, and alludes musically to the direction Ginn's guitar playing would go to on In My Head.
