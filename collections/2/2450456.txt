The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars.[103][104] Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found,[105] two low-mass white dwarfs[106] that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects,[107] and  Kepler-16b, a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star.
