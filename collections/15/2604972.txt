However, if a Hindu embraces a Dharma (duty) or a Varna other than the one he/she was already believed in, it is a sin according to Hinduism. An example for apostasy in Hinduism is the King Ravana. Ravana was born as a Brahmin but in his later life chose to be a Kshatriya. Because he did not follow his Dharma, he had committed a sin according to Hinduism. This is so because according to Lord Shiva, devotees should not leave their Varna for material pleasures. King Ravana later lost all of his wealth, his powers, became blind and was considered evil.[64] Criticizing, forgetting and opposing a Veda is also a sin in Hinduism according to Manusmriti verse 11.56.[65][66]
