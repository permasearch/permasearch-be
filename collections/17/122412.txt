His wife, Maria (Laura Benanti), is stationed overseas for a year, reporting in Iraq, and their marriage is strained by her deployment. In the fourteenth-season premiere, she reveals to Amaro that she is accepting a job in Washington, D.C., and following an argument, they separate. Amaro questions if Maria was diagnosed with PTSD, and expresses his regret that he did not try harder to understand what she was going through.[5] Maria offers to reconcile with Amaro if he moves to California with her and Zara. He ultimately refuses to do so, however.[6]
