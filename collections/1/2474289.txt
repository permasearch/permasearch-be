The year 1917 began well for the Hashemites when the Emir Abdullah and his Arab Eastern Army ambushed an Ottoman convoy led by Ashraf Bey in the desert, and captured £20,000 worth of gold coins that were intended to bribe the Bedouin into loyalty to the Sultan.[42] Starting in early 1917, the Hashemite guerrillas began attacking the Hejaz railroad.[43] At first, guerrilla forces commanded by officers from the Regular Army such as al-Misri, and by British officers such as Newcombe, Lieutenant Hornby and Major Herbert Garland focused their efforts on blowing up unguarded sections of the Hejaz railroad.[43] Garland was the inventor of the so-called "Garland mine", which was used with much destructive force on the Hejaz railroad.[44] In February 1917, Garland succeeded for the first time in destroying a moving locomotive with a mine of his own design.[44] Around Medina, Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho of the French Military Mission carried out his first railroad demolition attack in February 1917.[45] Captain Raho was to emerge as one of the leading destroyers of the Hejaz railroad.[45] In March 1917, Lawrence led his first attack on the Hejaz railroad.[46] Typical of such attacks were the one commanded out by Newcombe and Joyce who on the night of July 6/7, 1917 when they had planted over 500 charges on the Hejaz railroad, which all went off at about 2 am.[46] In a raid in August 1917, Captain Raho led a force of Bedouin in destroying 5 kilometers of the Hejaz railroad and four bridges.[47]
