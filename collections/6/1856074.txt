In recognition of the victory, the Confederate Congress passed a resolution of special thanks the officers and men of the Davis Guard. In addition, Houston residents raised funds to provide medals to the Guard; these were made from silver Mexican pesos by smoothing off the coins, then hand-stamping and hand-engraving on one side, the battle name and date and on the other side the initials "D G" and a maltese cross. The medals were hung on green ribbons, and presented to the members of the Davis Guard.[14][15] The official Confederate silver metals were presented in a military ceremony some time later.
