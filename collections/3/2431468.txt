The first major Canadian experience with directly state-owned enterprises came during the early growth of the railways.  During the earlier part of the century, many British North American colonies that now comprise the Canadian federation had Crown corporations, often in the form of railways, such as the Nova Scotia Railway, since there was limited private capital available for such endeavours.  When four British colonies joined to create the Canadian federation in 1867, these railways were transferred to the new central government.  As well, the construction of the Intercolonial Railway between them was one of the terms of the new constitution.  The first section of this entirely government-owned railway was completed in 1872.
