Malta is a popular tourist destination with its warm climate, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and historical monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ä¦al Saflieni Hypogeum,[24] Valletta,[25] and seven megalithic temples, which are some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world.[26][27][28] The Azure Window was one of Malta, and Gozo's, most famous landmarks. It collapsed dramatically into the sea after a heavy storm in 2017.[29]
