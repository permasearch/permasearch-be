Special districts in the United States are founded by some level of government in accordance with state law [12] (either constitutional amendment, general law, or special acts)[13] and exist in all states. Special districts are legally separate entities with at least some corporate powers.[14] Districts are created by legislative action, court action, or public referendum. The procedures for creating a special district may include procedures such as petitions, hearings, voter or landowner approval, or government approval. Tribal governments may create special districts pursuant to state law and may serve on the boards of special districts.
