Fish gills are the preferred habitat of many ectoparasites (parasites attached to the gill but living out of it); the most commons are monogeneans and certain groups of parasitic copepods, which can be extremely numerous.[13] Other ectoparasites found on gills are leeches and, in seawater, larvae of gnathiid isopods.[14] Endoparasites (parasites living inside the gills) include encysted adult didymozoid trematodes,[15] a few trichosomoidid nematodes of the genus Huffmanela, including Huffmanela ossicola which lives within the gill bone,[16] and the encysted parasitic turbellarian Paravortex.[17] Various protists and Myxosporea are also parasitic on gills, where they form cysts.
