From May 1944 to March 1945, Hemingway was in London and Europe. When Hemingway first arrived in London, he met Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated. Martha had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because Hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane, and she arrived in London to find Hemingway hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. Unsympathetic to his plight, she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was "through, absolutely finished".[102] The last time that Hemingway saw Martha was in March 1945 as he was preparing to return to Cuba,[103] and their divorce was finalized later that same year.[102] Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.[102]
