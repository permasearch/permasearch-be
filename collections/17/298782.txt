In 1999, 5.6% of Canadian students were enrolled in private schools,[9] some of which are religious or faith-based schools, including Christian, Catholic, Jewish, and Islamic schools. Some private schools in Canada are considered world class, especially some boarding schools with a long and illustrious history. Private schools have sometimes been controversial, with some[10] in the media and in Ontario's Provincial Ministry of Education asserting that students may buy inflated grades from private schools.[11]
