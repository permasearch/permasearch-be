Since the 19th-century Indian modernists have re-asserted the 'Aryan origins' of Hinduism, "purifying" Hinduism from its Tantric elements[70] and elevating the Vedic elements. Hindu modernists like Vivekananda see the Vedas as the laws of the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages.[253][254] In Tantric tradition, the Agamas refer to authoritative scriptures or the teachings of Shiva to Shakti,[255] while Nigamas refers to the Vedas and the teachings of Shakti to Shiva.[255] In Agamic schools of Hinduism, the Vedic literature and the Agamas are equally authoritative.[256][257]
