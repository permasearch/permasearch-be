Human Development Theory has roots in ancient philosophy and early economic theory. Aristotle noted that "Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking, for it is merely useful for something else", and Adam Smith and Karl Marx were concerned with human capabilities. The theory grew in importance in the 1980s with the work of Amartya Sen and his Human Capabilities perspective, which played a role in his receiving the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. Notable early economists active who formulated the modern concept of human development theory were Mahbub ul Haq, Ãœner Kirdar, and Amartya Sen. The Human Development Index  developed for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stems from this early research.[8] In 2000, Sen and Sudhir Anand published a notable development of the theory to address issues in sustainability.[9][10]
