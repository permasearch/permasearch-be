Omega did not reappear in the Marvel Comics continuity, though his remains were seen being worked on by Autobot medic Ratchet in an attempt to bring him back on-line. There is no indication that, unlike most of Starscream's other victims, he was reactivated by Nucleon. (Though chances are, had the toyline and comic continued, that would have been the case.)
