The chylomicrons circulate throughout the body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal.[citation needed] Lipoprotein lipase on the endothelial surfaces of the capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but to a lesser extent also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, glycerol and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes[citation needed], but the glycerol and chylomicron remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes[citation needed], where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway[citation needed]. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the fuel requirements of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the adipocyte.
