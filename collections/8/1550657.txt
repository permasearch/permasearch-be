Hoover's tenure was defined by his response to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 which struck less than eight months after he took office. He introduced large-scale government public works projects such as the Hoover Dam, but believed private initiative could lead to recovery better than government stimulus; historians see Hoover’s economic policies as too limited to deal with the economic crisis. Hoover called on industry to keep wages high while scapegoating Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants for the downturn. Hoover championed the mass ethnic cleansing campaign known as the Mexican Repatriation, where between 500,000 and 2,000,000 Mexican Americans and immigrants were deported to Mexico—a supermajority were citizens, with an estimated 60 percent being natural-born citizens. The construction of the Hoover Dam and the Repatriation both ended in 1936, after Hoover left office.
