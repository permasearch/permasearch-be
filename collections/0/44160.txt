One distinguishes between α- and β-glycosidic bonds based on the relative stereochemistry (R or S) of the anomeric position and the stereocenter furthest from C1 in the saccharide.[2] An α-glycosidic bond is formed when both carbons have the same stereochemistry, whereas a β-glycosidic bond occurs when the two carbons have different stereochemistry. One complicating issue is that the alpha and beta conformations were originally defined based on the relative orientation of the major constituents in a Haworth projection. In this case, for D-sugars, a beta conformation would see the major constituent at each carbon drawn above the plane of the ring (nominally the same conformation), while alpha would see the anomeric constituent below the ring (nominally opposite conformations). For L-sugars, the definitions would then, necessarily, reverse. This is worth noting as these older definitions still permeate the literature and can lead to confusion.
