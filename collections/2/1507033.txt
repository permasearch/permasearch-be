Described by Badu as "TRap & B", the mixtape takes influence from hip hop, R&B, jazz, and art rock, with lyrics that focus on the themes of communication, notably through phones, with lyrics that touch upon ideas of "missed connections, call waiting, answering machines". The mixtape debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, generating 35,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.[1]
