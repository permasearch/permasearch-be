CFOP is heavily used and relied upon by many speedcubers, including Rowe Hessler, Mats Valk, and Feliks Zemdegs for its heavy reliance on algorithms, pattern recognition and muscle memory; as opposed to more intuitive methods such as the Roux or Petrus method.  The majority of top speed cubers on the WCA ranking list are CFOP solvers.[5]
