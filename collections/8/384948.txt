In an early draft of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Angie, the daughter of T-Virus' creator Dr. Charles Ashford, was to be revealed as the girl on whose appearance the Red Queen was based on, and her father as the person that build the supercomputer that houses her. When the filmmakers realized they would need a large amount of flashback footage from the previous film to explain the connection to those in the audience that had not seen it, they decided to drop the idea, removing it from the canon.[6] Nevertheless, some people have made the connection due to Angie's appearance and accent strongly evoking the Red Queen.[7] The novelization of Resident Evil: Extinction also explicitly states the connection.
