A community college is a type of educational institution. The term can have different meanings in different countries: all community colleges have an “open enrollment” with a high school completion, but usually refers to an educational institution that provides workforce education and college transfer academic programs. Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their four-year counterparts.
