In the final, which took place in Los Angeles's Rose Bowl stadium 2,700 miles (4,320 km) and three time zones away from the Atlantic Northeast part of the United States where they had played all their previous matches, Italy, who had 24 hours less rest than Brazil, played 120 minutes of scoreless football, taking the match to a penalty shootout, the first time a World Cup final was settled in a penalty shootout.[38] Italy lost the subsequent shootout 3–2 after Baggio, who had been playing with the aid of a pain-killer injection[39] and a heavily bandaged hamstring,[40][41] missed the final penalty kick of the match, shooting over the crossbar.[42][43]
