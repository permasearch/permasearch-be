On Carl Sagan's 75th birthday (November 9, 2009) the Planetary Society announced plans[79] to make three further attempts, dubbed LightSail-1, -2, and -3.[80] The new design will use a 32 m2 Mylar sail, deployed in four triangular segments like NanoSail-D.[80] The launch configuration is a 3U CubeSat format, and as of 2015, it is scheduled as a secondary payload for a 2016 launch on the first SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch.[81] "LightSail-1" was launched on 20 May 2015.[82] The purpose of the test was to allow a full checkout of the satellite's systems in advance of the main 2016 mission, LightSail-1.
