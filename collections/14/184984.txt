Some writers like to reflect standard spoken practice in cases like these with sake: for convenience' sake, for goodness’ sake, for appearance' sake, for compromise’ sake, etc. This punctuation is preferred in major style guides. Others prefer to add ’s: for convenience’s sake.[34] Still others prefer to omit the apostrophe when there is an s sound before sake: for morality’s sake, but for convenience sake.[35]
