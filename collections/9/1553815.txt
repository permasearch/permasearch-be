There are the great cosmic gods representing the first principle in its unmanifested state or its creative order—Yudi (玉帝 "Jade Deity")[note 3] and Doumu (斗母 "Mother of the Meaning" or "Great Chariot"), Pangu (盤古, the macranthropic metaphor of the cosmos), Xiwangmu (西王母 "Queen Mother of the West") and Dongwanggong (東王公 "King Duke of the East") who personificate respectively the yin and the yang,[195] as well as the dimensional Three Patrons and the Five Deities; then there are the sky and weather gods, the scenery gods, the vegetal and animal gods, and gods of human virtues and crafts.[78] These are interpreted in different ways in Taoism and folk sects, the former conferring them long kataphatic names.[78] Below the great deities, there is the unquantifiable number of gods of nature, as every phenomena have or are gods.
