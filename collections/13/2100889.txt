The series was later purchased by Pearson Television (which later became FremantleMedia, which now owns the rights to the series), who also owns the Goodsonâ€“Todman and Reg Grundy libraries. Since then, the company has handled revivals and video game licenses, such as with Whammy! and the 2009 video game. On June 8, 2006, Press Your Luck was featured as the fourth round of Gameshow Marathon on CBS.
