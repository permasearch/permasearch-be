"She's Out of Her Mind" is a song recorded by American rock band Blink-182 for the group's seventh studio album, California (2016). The song was released as the second single from California on October 11, 2016 through BMG. Written by bassist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, guitarist Matt Skiba, and producer John Feldmann, the song was re-written multiple times to make its chorus as catchy as possible. It contains lyrical references to the bands the Cure and Bauhaus. It was inspired by relationships the group had growing up with "crazy" girls.
