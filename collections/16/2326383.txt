The three ironclad ships selected differed substantially in design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy.[d] Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.[22]
