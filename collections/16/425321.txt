Spencer hears her dad on the phone with someone, yelling and specifically complaining that Jason is home. Spencer tries to strike up a conversation with her father, as he searches for an unhealthy night-time snack. The Liars meet with Jessica DiLaurentis for lunch shortly afterwards, despite their awkward reservations. She then presents the girls with presents; four high fashion dresses and asks the girls to model them in the fashion show. Just before the show, Spencer hands Noel the disc Mona asked her to deliver to him. In the corner of the room, Jessica and Peter have an argument. The fashion shows starts, and later the tribute to Alison begins, with her image prominent on the runway screen and the girls walking the runway in her dresses. Suddenly, the image changes so as to make Alison look like the devil, with fire around and peeling black eyes. The screen flashes "the bitch is dead," and the music changes from sentimental to hellish. Spencer runs to Noel to make him turn it off, but he claims he can't. She unplugs all the wires around his equipment until the images and sound effects stop.
