Saint John's Abbey Energy Farm. The Saint John's Abbey is well known for having one of the largest solar fields in the state.[38] The original 3.9-acre facility was built in 2009, and its tracking panels provide the university with about 4% of its annual energy needs and up to 20% of its real-time needs in peak conditions. In 2014, the Solar Farm was expanded to include 616 additional fixed panels.[39][40] These new panels will allow the Solar Farm to produce more than 600 kilowatts of electricityâ€”enough energy to power up to 30% of the SJU campus in peak conditions, and 6% of its energy annually. This project creates research opportunity for students and others to compare the performance differences between the two types of panels.[41]
