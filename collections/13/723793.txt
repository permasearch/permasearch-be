where       σ ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}}   is the average of the absolute shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g. equation 3 of Venkataraman & Kanamori 2004). Currently, there is no technology to measure absolute stresses at all depths of interest, or method to estimate it accurately, thus       σ ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}}   is poorly known. It could be highly variable from one earthquake to another. Two earthquakes with identical      M  0     {\displaystyle M_{0}}   but different       σ ¯     {\displaystyle {\overline {\sigma }}}   would have released different     Δ W   {\displaystyle \Delta W}  .
