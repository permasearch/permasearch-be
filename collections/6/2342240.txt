Musil's documentary also highlights the feeling among many military brats that the culture and lives of military brats are largely invisible to most Americans.[2] Some sparse and superficial aspects of military brat life may be known, but a fuller sense of awareness of one of America's largest (and oldest) subcultures is largely non-existent.[2] The documentary starts with country music singer and former military brat Kris Kristofferson calling military brats "an invisible tribe" comprising 5% of the American population.[2]
