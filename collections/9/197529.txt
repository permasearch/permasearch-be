The War Salon commemorates the victorious campaign of Louis XIV against the Dutch, which ended in 1678.  The centerpiece is an enormous sculpted medallion of Louis XIV, on horseback, crossing the Rhine in 1672, created by Antoine Coysevox.  Above the fireplace is a painting of Clio, the Muse of History, recording the exploits of the King.
