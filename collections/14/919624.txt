The plankton factory is near San Luis in AztlÃ¡n, in the desert left where the Gulf of California has dried up. It is a forced labor camp run by the "Keepers" on collectivist, Marxist principles for all of the orphans, or "Lost Boys," of the territory, where plankton is harvested as a food source for the world's increasing population. After escaping the Farm Patrol and being rescued by the Keepers, Matt is transferred there from the original camp along the border with Opium. There, he and several of his fellow inmates are subjected to physical beatings and psychological torture if they dare to challenge the system in any way, and Matt is described by the Keepers as an "aristocrat" for trying to incite dissent and imbuing his fellow orphans with ideas that don't fall in line with the Keepers' way of thinking. Later, he plans a rebellion to save both himself and the other Lost Boys, but his plans only come to fruition after he is forced to spend the night in the "boneyard," a massive graveyard consisting of the skeletal remains of beached whales that have formed sinkholes, which lies near the factory's outermost perimeter.
