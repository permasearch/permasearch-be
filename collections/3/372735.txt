The NASCAR points system has undergone several incarnations since its initial implementation. Originally, races awarded points by a complicated system based upon final positioning and weighted by prize money purses, such that higher-paying events gave more points. Soon after the advent of the modern era in 1972, the championship was decided by a more basic cumulative point total based solely upon a driver's finishing position in each race. In order to reduce the possibility of a driver clinching before the final event, NASCAR implemented the "Chase for the Cup" in 2004 which, with minor modification from 2004 to 2013[3] and more radical changes in 2014,[4] stands as the current format. Before the final ten races, 16 drivers, chosen primarily on race wins, are reset to an equal amount of points, with bonus points awarded to a driver for each win prior to the reset.[4] With these changes, the last Drivers' Champion to clinch before the final race was Matt Kenseth in 2003.[5]
