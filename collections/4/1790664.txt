Like the highlands, there is a high degree of environmental variability in the Mesoamerican lowlands, ranging from the lush tropical climate of lowland Veracruz to the semi-arid brush forests of northern YucatÃ¡n. On the southeast coast of the Gulf of Mexico, in Belize, and in southern Campeche and Quintana Roo, rainfall can be quite heavy. The tropical forests found there are diverse in the vegetation species present and this, in addition to the overabundance of water, presented obstacles inhibiting the development of agriculture (but this is not to say that agriculture did not develop in the lowlands). To offset the environmental constraints, the ancient Mesoamericans employed a series of agricultural adaptations. One such adaptation was the use of drainage systems, exemplified by the camellones chontales found in the Chontalpa region of Tabasco.[citation needed] Another systematic adaptation was the use of raised-field agriculture, as seen at the Preclassic site of Cerros, in Belize.
