Gardner was taken to the University of Utah Health Services Center where he was listed in serious condition, but recovered. Burdell died about 45 minutes later while in surgery at Holy Cross Hospital.[6][16][20] Kirk survived surgery and was listed in critical condition at LDS Hospital. During a search of the courthouse, a bag of men's clothing was found in the basement under a women's restroom sink.[18] Prosecutor Bob Stott believed Gardner's gun had been taped to a water fountain on the first floor.[8] Darcy Perry McCoy was found unarmed and was arrested about a mile away.[21] Her sister, Carma Jolley Hainsworth, was sentenced to eight years in prison for delivering the clothes and messages in preparation for the escape attempt,[22] but the identity of the person who provided Gardner with the firearm was not known at the time.[17] State corrections director William Vickrey cleared the actions of the prison guards who escorted Gardner,[23] but Salt Lake County Sheriff N.D. "Pete" Hayward said that the guard who shot Gardner should have kept shooting until Gardner was dead.[24] A review found that the guards were inhibited from shooting because Gardner had been using a hostage as a human shield.[25] Sheriff Hayward said the escape attempt "appeared to be well-planned" and blamed the security breach on the layout of the Metropolitan Hall of Justice, which allowed unrestricted access to areas where prisoners were transported.[8][18][26]
