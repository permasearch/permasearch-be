After Kate's death, like the other characters, DiNozzo also has a vision of her postmortem. Typical to Tony's chauvinistic personality, Kate appears in the Catholic schoolgirl uniform that he had been asking about in the episode "Bikini Wax". After telling him that she always knew what he was thinking, she realizes that she is wearing the uniform and quickly berates him, saying, "Tony, I just died, and you're having a sexual fantasy?" to which he replies, "Can't help it. Sometimes I used to picture you naked" and she responds by screaming in shock seconds before Ziva David is introduced for the first time. This "sexual fantasy" is portrayed after Tony offers to go back out in the pouring rain to find the bullet that killed Kate and becomes upset when McGee improves the answer he had told to Gibbs.[73]
