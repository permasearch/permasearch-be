The third generation Avalon was larger than previous versions, with Calty styling and drag coefficient ofÂ Cd=0.29; the Avalon also became the first Toyota to use a single piece wiper blade design. The redesign dropped the front bench seat option, a feature once common among large American sedans such as Buicks and Cadillacs, and featured a semi-flat rear floor to help increase rear passenger comfort.
