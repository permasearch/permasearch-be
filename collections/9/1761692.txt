Terminal E has a total of 12 gates numbered E1-E12. Gates E10-E12 were recently reconstructed as part of the terminal E modernization project to accommodate Airbus A380 aircraft. In this, a second jet bridge was added to each of those three gates to make upper-level boarding on the A380 possible. Currently, British Airways has seasonal A380 service to Logan, although Emirates has expressed interest in using their A380s on their route between Dubai and Logan, and vice versa. All gates within the terminal are designated as common-use, meaning gates are assigned mostly based on an operational need, and no specific airline claims ownership of any of those gates.[72] All ticket counters and gates in Terminal E are shared among the international carriers. Terminal E has several airline lounges (e.g., Air France Lounge,[73] British Airways' First Lounge and Terraces Lounge,[74] Lufthansa's First Lounge and Business Lounges,[75] Virgin Atlantic's Clubhouse Lounge[76]).
