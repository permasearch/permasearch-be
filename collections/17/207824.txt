Europeans began to learn about the origins of the Nile in the 15th and 16th centuries, when travelers to Ethiopia visited Lake Tana and the source of the Blue Nile in the mountains south of the lake. Although James Bruce claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters,[46] modern writers give the credit to the Jesuit Pedro Páez. Páez's account of the source of the Nile[47] is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia. It was published in full only in the early 20th century, although it was featured in works of Páez's contemporaries, including Baltazar Téllez,[48] Athanasius Kircher[49] and by Johann Michael Vansleb.[50]
