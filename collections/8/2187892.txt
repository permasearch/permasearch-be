Both Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger are strongly associated with the abortion issue today.[25][26] For much of the organization's history, however, and throughout Sanger's life, abortion was illegal in the United States, and discussions of the issue were often censored.[27] During this period, Sanger – like other American advocates of birth control – publicly condemned abortion, arguing that it would not be needed if every woman had access to birth control.[27]
