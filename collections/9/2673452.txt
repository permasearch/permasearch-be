On 19 September 1980 a fuel leak caused a Titan II to explode within its silo in Arkansas, throwing the W53 warhead some distance away. Due to the safety measures built into the weapon, it did not explode or release any radioactive material.[14] 52 active missiles were deployed in silos prior to the beginning of the retirement program in October 1982.[13] With the retirement of the Titan fleet, disassembly of the W53 warheads was completed by about 1988.[citation needed]
