TTC had added womenâ€™s and juniors tournaments, collegiate tennis, unique qualifier formats, paddle tennis, platform tennis, air hockey, foosball and table tennis to the TTC Open by 2008. With the gaining of broadcasting rights to three Grand Slam tournaments that was growing its core media business and a changing tournament schedule slated for 2009, The Tennis Channel sold their tourney to Association of Tennis Professionals in April 2008.[9] In 2009, the channel broadcast its first United States Open.[2]
