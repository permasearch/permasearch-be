"One" was released as a benefit single, with proceeds going towards AIDS research. The song topped the Irish Singles Charts and US Billboard Album Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and it peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created.
