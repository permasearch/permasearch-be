Dr. Neil Gordon is in charge of trying to treat the children at Westin Hills for their refusal to sleep and experiences of bad dreams. After meeting Nancy Thompson, he begins to believe that their dreams may be more than group delusion. He meets with Nancy's father, Donald Thompson, to discover the remains of Freddy Krueger and lay him to rest but when they uncover the bones, they reanimate and attack both Gordon and Donald, killing Donald. After the bones return to their grave, Gordon regains consciousness and performs last rites on them, seemingly defeating Freddy.[3]
