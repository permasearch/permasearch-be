Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.[108] With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.[109] Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain's commander on the Western Front.
