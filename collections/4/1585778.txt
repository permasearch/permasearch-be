One of the claims is "Comcast would be able to use its vertically integrated position to deny rival distributors access to programming or to raise the cost of that programming". Comcast-NBC will face two rival distributors â€“ the satellite and telephone company and the new entrant. Of course, both of them are worrying about the domination which Comcast-NBC may be capable of establishing and the entry barrier. The big challenge for the satellite and telephone company is to find a new business model to convince the programmers that their model will benefit them more than Comcast-NBC. However, Comcast-NBC also keeps improving their business model, which is unhappy to the new entrant.
