The day after the Pepsi commercial premiered, Madonna released the actual music video for "Like a Prayer" on MTV.[73] Religious groups worldwide including the Vatican immediately protested the clip, saying that it contained blasphemous use of Christian imagery.[74][75] They called for the national boycott of Pepsi and PepsiCo's subsidiaries, including fast food chains Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.[75] Pepsi initially wanted to continue airing the commercial, although were taken aback by the protests.[76] They explained the differences between their advertisement and Madonna's artistic opinions in the video. Ultimately Pepsi gave up to the protests and cancelled the campaign. According to Taraborrelli, the company was so eager to extricate themselves from the collaboration that they even allowed Madonna to keep the $5Â million advance.[75][77] In the meantime, Pope John Paul II involved himself in the matter and encouraged fans to boycott the singer in Italy. Protests from a small Catholic organization in the country prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's record company WEA to not air the video there.[78] The video was also deemed offensive by the American Family Association (AFA). Madonna stated that "art should be controversial, and that's all there is to it", about the controversy.[22]
