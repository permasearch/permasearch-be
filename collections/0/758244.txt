In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to join the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of sixty-two academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. Florida is one of the seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU. In 2009, President Bernie Machen and the University of Florida Board of Trustees announced a major policy transition for the university. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research.[39] In 2017 the University of Florida became the first university in the state of Florida to crack the top ten best public universities according to U.S. News.[40] As of 2016 the University of Florida generated $791.3 Million in Research Expenditures.[41]
