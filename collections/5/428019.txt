In May 2009 South Australian Premier Mike Rann opened the $1.15 billion Prominent Hill Mine, 130 kilometres (81Â mi) South East of Coober Pedy. The copper-gold mine is operated by OZ Minerals.[25] In August 2010 Premier Rann opened the Cairn Hill iron ore/copper/gold mine operated by IMX Resources near Coober Pedy.  It was the first new iron ore mining area opened in South Australia since the 19th Century.[26] Due to low iron ore prices, the Cairn Hill mine was closed in June 2014.[27]
