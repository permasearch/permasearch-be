The band's first full-length album, 12 Bar Bruise, was released on 7 September 2012.[7] The 12-track garage rock album was self-recorded, and several tracks used unconventional recording methods. For example, the vocals for the album's title track were recorded through four iPhones placed around a room while Mackenzie sang into one of them.[8]
