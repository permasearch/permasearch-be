The tide of public opinion was beginning to turn in Kentucky, however. In a special congressional election held June 20, 1861, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats.[13] Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region,[19] which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers.[20] Seeing imminent defeat at the polls, many Southern Rights Advocates boycotted the election; the total number of ballots cast was just over half the number that had been cast in the previous year's election.[21] Governor Magoffin was dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate.[22]
