Multiple cities are used for establishing shots, including Vancouver, Baltimore, Boston, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Jersey City, Philadelphia, and Brussels.[18] Reference is made to an area in Starling City known as the Glades where the criminal element is particularly predominant, similar to the Narrows and Crime Alley in Gotham City, with most of the first season concerning Oliver's attempts to unravel "the Undertaking", a plan to level the Glades using a machine that artificially generates earthquakes. Following the Undertaking- Oliver manages to shut down one of the earthquake machines in time but was unaware of the second- over five hundred people died in the attack on the Glades, prompting Oliver to return to the island for a period of self-imposed exile before he returns to protect the city and help it rebuild after the destruction.
