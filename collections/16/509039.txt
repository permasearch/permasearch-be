A number of names have entered common American usage following the popularity of a luxury brand. The name Tiffany began its lifespan solely as a surname. It was popularized as a given name in the late 1960s and 70s because of the success of the luxury jewelry store Tiffany & co. Other names like Cristal have the same origins as the names of luxury brands. The perception of names taken from luxury brands is mixed. Families of low socioeconomic status are more likely to use luxury brand names than families of higher socioeconomic backgrounds for the same aspirational reasons as surname names are used.[citation needed] This name usage leads to the association that the names themselves are lower class names. A few examples of luxury brand inspired names have had usage throughout the socioeconomic spectrum. Lauren was relatively uncommon until Ralph Lauren became a popular clothier.[citation needed] At the height of its popularity, it was used widely. Tiffany also had widespread usage.[2][14]
