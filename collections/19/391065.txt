On the first live show, John & Edward performed Robbie Williams' hit "Rock DJ". Cowell said afterwards, "It was a musical nightmare." and that "The truth is... is that Louis has put you through because you're Irish."[75] In week 3, after singing Ricky Martin's "She Bangs", the studio audience heckled the twins, but Walsh confronted the audience by saying: "Boo all you bloody want. I don't like bullying."[76] John & Edward were in the bottom two with Lucie Jones in week 5, but were saved after the judges' vote went to deadlock. In week 6, John & Edward sang a mashup of "Under Pressure" and "Ice Ice Baby". During the song, Scottish DJ Calvin Harris invaded the stage with a pineapple on his head to poke fun at their quiffs and was thrown out of the studio. Harris later apologised for his behaviour, posting on his Twitter page: "At the end of the day, I had a pineapple on my head. Sorry if I caused anyone embarrassment. P.S. I love Jedward." The twins were praised by Walsh, who said that it was their best performance of the competition. He also praised them for ignoring Harris's stage invasion. John & Edward's performance also won over harshest critic Cowell, who said: "I can't judge you in the real world any more. I have to judge you in Jedwardland, wherever that planet exists; and so if I kind of take myself there, I would say that was your best performance. And I have to say this: There's no point in me getting angry or serious about this, if people like you, they like you. I have to tell this as well guys. You've conducted yourself very well in this competition. You just get on with it".[77] John & Edward were eliminated from the competition in week 7 by the judges after being in the bottom two with Olly Murs. However voting statistics showed that John & Edward had received more votes than Murs, meaning if Minogue sent the result to deadlock, John & Edward would've been sent through to the quarter-final and Murs would've been eliminated.[78]
