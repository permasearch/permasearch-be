The 1990 awards ceremony saw the last public appearance of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.[15] Queen appeared at the ceremony to receive the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.[15][16] Mercury (who had been suffering from AIDS since 1987 but had not disclosed it to the public) did not make a speech, as Brian May did the talking on behalf of the other members, but his gaunt appearance was noticeable.[17]
