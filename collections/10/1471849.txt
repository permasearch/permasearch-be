Summer Olympic sports are divided into five categories (A â€“ E) based on popularity, gauged by six categories: television viewing figures (40%), Internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category determines the share the sport's International Federation receives of Olympic revenue.[26][27] Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.
