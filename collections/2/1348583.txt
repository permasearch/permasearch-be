Lead vocalist Mike Score says that there were two main sources of inspiration for "I Ran (So Far Away)". The members of A Flock of Seagulls would regularly visit Eric's Club in Liverpool, where one of the band's had a song called "I Ran". Score noted that because A Flock of Seagulls would rehearse right after returning from Eric's, the song title and chorus may have gotten stuck in his head. Another source of inspiration came from a poster at a Zoo Records office, which featured a man and a woman running away from a flying saucer. The band went to Zoo Records with the intent of securing a recording contract, and they wanted to use the poster as the cover for their first album, A Flock of Seagulls (1982). This poster served as the inspiration for the song's unusual space-like lyrics.[2]
