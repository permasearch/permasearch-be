Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Browns flew to The Meadowlands for a Week 14 intraconference duel with the New York Jets. After a scoreless first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood in the second quarter as QB Derek Anderson completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Jamal Lewis. The Jets would reply with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 35-yard field goal.
