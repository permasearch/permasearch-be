Elle's snobby classmates disapprove of her attire, and the only person who is willing to help her is law-teaching assistant Emmett Forrest ("The Harvard Variations"). However, he can't protect her in class from the bloodthirsty Professor Callahan ("Blood In The Water"). Callahan kicks the under-prepared Elle out of class at the suggestion of her classmate Vivienne Kensington, who happens to be Warner's new girlfriend. This "tragedy" summons the apparitions of the sisters of Delta Nu, who, acting as a Greek Chorus visible and audible only to Elle, encourage her to stay positive ("Positive"). Elle, believing that being blonde is the problem, decides to become a brunette. She heads to the Hair Affair salon where she meets the spunky beautician Paulette, who, after talking Elle out of her hair-dye plan, tells Elle that when she is down, she puts on her favorite CD, Celtic Moods, and dreams of Ireland and her dream Irishman ("Ireland"). At the salon, Vivienne gives Elle an unexpected invitation to a costume party. Paulette sends Elle off with a costume for the party with lyrics of encouragement ("Ireland (Reprise)").
