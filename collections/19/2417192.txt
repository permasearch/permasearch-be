Gordon Liddy played a major role in developing these tactics during the Nixon campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the campaign of 1972.[citation needed] James Carville, campaign manager of Bill Clinton's 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.[citation needed] Lee Atwater, best known for being an advisor to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.[4]
