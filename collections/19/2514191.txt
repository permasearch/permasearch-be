The Basilique du Sacré-Cœur is a Roman Catholic Basilica, which was built in 1914 and consecrated in 1919.[17] It is located at one of the highest altitudes in Paris, at butte Montmartre. The church contains one of the world's largest mosaic of Jesus Christ with his arms wide spread. The basilica was built in the honour of the 58,000 lives lost in the Franco-Prussian war in the year 1870.[18] Paul Abadie, the winner of the competition to find the right architectural design, was the architect for the basilica.[19] The basilica offers some beautiful panoramic views of Paris. The walls of the church are naturally always white and clean, due to the travertine stone been used.[20] The stone reacts with water and creates a chemical called calcite, which acts as a natural bleacher. It is one of the most iconic monuments of Paris.[21]
