Sue arrived at Saanapu and everyone was shocked to see her, Brooke selecting Sue her as she had no connection to Saanapu and seemed the least threatening. Nick planned on questioning her about why she decided to vote him out. At Vavau, Kristie had a feeling that she was being targeted by Conner, Kate and Sue and thus felt very relieved about the fact that there was no votes cast. Phoebe still reassured Kate and Conner that Kristie remains the intended target and reaffirmed her power in the tribe. In the morning, Phoebe talked with Kristie about the current state of the tribe, during which the camp set on fire.
