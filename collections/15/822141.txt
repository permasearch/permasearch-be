Beginning around 1630 BCE, the Hyksos, possibly related to the Amorites,[294] seized control of Egypt, establishing their Fifteenth Dynasty with its capital at Avaris.[295][296] Although vilified in later Egyptian texts, the Hyksos became highly Egyptianized and ruled as pharaohs listed as legitimate kings in the Turin Papyrus.[295] The Hyksos capital was seized around 1521 BCE by the Theban Ahmose, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the Hyksos were expelled.[286] The Hyksos may have been related to the later Habiru, etymologically connected to the term Hebrew.[294]
