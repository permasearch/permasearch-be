In his retirement, Madison occasionally became involved in public affairs, advising Andrew Jackson and other presidents.[162] He remained out of the public debate over the Missouri Compromise, though he privately complained about the North's opposition to the extension of slavery.[163] Madison had warm relations with all four of the major candidates in the 1824 presidential election, but, like Jefferson, largely stayed out of the race.[164] During Jackson's presidency, Madison publicly disavowed the Nullification movement and argued that no state had the right to secede.[165]
