where     γ   {\displaystyle \gamma }   is the (complex) propagation constant. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory. They are also wave equations, and have solutions similar to the special case, but which are a mixture of sines and cosines with exponential decay factors. Solving for the propagation constant     γ   {\displaystyle \gamma }   in terms of the primary parameters     R   {\displaystyle R}  ,     L   {\displaystyle L}  ,     G   {\displaystyle G}  , and     C   {\displaystyle C}   gives:
