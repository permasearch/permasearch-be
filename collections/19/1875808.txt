Harry's Bar was opened in 1931 by bartender Giuseppe Cipriani (it).[1] According to the company history, Harry Pickering—a rich, young Bostonian—had been frequenting Hotel Europa in Venice, where Giuseppe Cipriani was a bartender.[1]  When Pickering suddenly stopped coming to the hotel bar, Cipriani asked him why.[1]  When Pickering explained that he was broke because his family found out his drinking habits and cut him off financially, Cipriani lent him 10,000 lire (about $500 US [$7,839 in 2015 dollars]).[1]  Two years later, Pickering returned to the hotel bar, ordered a drink, and gave Cipriani 50,000 lire in return.[1]  "Mr. Cipriani, thank you," he said, according to the Cipriani website.[1] "Here's the money. And to show you my appreciation, here's 40,000 more, enough to open a bar. We will call it Harry's Bar."[1]
