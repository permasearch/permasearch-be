Along with the styling upgrades, 1975 Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by Bendix,[55] the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). To further improve the emissions performance of the 460 V8, the engine was fitted with catalytic converters, ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline.
