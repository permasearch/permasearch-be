Starting in about 3500 B.C., various writing systems developed in ancient civilizations around the world. In Egypt fully developed hieroglyphs were in use at Abydos as early as 3400 B.C.[3] The oldest known alphabet was developed in central Egypt around 2000 B.C. from a hieroglyphic prototype. One hieroglyphic script was used on stone monuments,[4] other cursive scripts were used for writing in ink on papyrus,[4] a flexible, paper-like material, made from the stems of reeds that grow in marshes and beside rivers such as the River Nile.
