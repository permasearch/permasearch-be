In the fourth phase of prophase I, diplotene (from the Greek for “twofold”), crossing-over is completed.[3][10] Homologous chromosomes retain a full set of genetic information; however, the homologous chromosomes are now of mixed maternal and paternal descent.[3] Visible junctions called chiasmata hold the homologous chromosomes together at locations where recombination occurred as the synaptonemal complex dissolves.[12][3] It is at this stage where meiotic arrest occurs in many species.[3]
