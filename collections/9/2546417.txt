Many head shop products became illegal in Ireland on 23 August 2010[16] when the new Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 became law.[17] The Act empowered Garda√≠ (Irish police) to seek court orders to close head shops suspected of selling drug-like products, with the onus on the owners to prove they are not doing so.
