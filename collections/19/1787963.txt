The Lords are paid a visit by Jobst, the Margrave of Moravia, and King Wenceslaus' cousin. Together they discuss the state of Bohemia; Wenceslaus lies captive in Vienna, while Sigismund continues to plunder the kingdom. However, his homeland of Hungary has gone on to revolt against him, and he is vulnerable in choosing between staying to capture the Bohemian Crown, or return home to ensure his rule in his own domain. Jobst proposes a plan to set a strategic alliance with Sigismund's supporters, who are put off by the uprising and fear his defeat, to end the war at once. Although the Lords are uncertain of the plan, they agree to rescue and restore Wenceslaus to the throne and end Sigismund's raid peacefully.
