After a routine cleaning and checkup at the dentist, Kevin gets his first cavity and needs a filling; but feels embarrassed that he'll wimp out in the presence of beautiful denial hygienist Miss Hasenfuss (Whitney Kershaw), and asks Dr. Tucker to make arrangements for Miss Hasenfuss not to be there for the filling. Miss Hasenfuss is then replaced by the much older, crabby, and hoarse-voiced Mrs. Craw, making Kevin feel even more uncomfortable. But after he finds out that Miss Hasenfuss is taking his advice on going back to school to become a dentist herself, Kevin has the courage to ask her to assist Dr. Tucker one last time before she leaves.
