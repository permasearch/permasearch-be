There are some chemicals that will selectively kill only crayfish that have not been registered or labeled for crayfish control. Unfortunately, the chemicals do kill all species of crayfish, and are not specific to rusty crayfish.[16] Manual harvest for human consumption is an effective control strategy due to the large size of rusty crayfish. However, this strategy is only useful in reducing the adult population. Once a population of rusty crayfish is introduced to a body of water, it is very difficult to completely eradicate them. Therefore, the best control strategy is to try to prevent any further spread of the rusty crayfish. The best ways to prevent invasive species spread is to learn to identify the invasive species, and not use the species as bait or transport the species to bodies of water where it is not already present.[9]
