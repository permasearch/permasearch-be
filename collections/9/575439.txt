The minting of coins was decentralised in the Saxon period; every borough was mandated to have a mint and therefore a centre for trading in bullion.[42] Nonetheless, there was strict royal control over these moneyers, and coin dies could only be made in London.[42] William retained this process and generated a high standard of Norman coins, leading to the use of the term "sterling" as the name for the Norman silver coins.[42]
