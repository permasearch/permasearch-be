Three European microstates – Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City – can be considered as de facto within the Schengen Area. They do not have border controls with the Schengen countries that surround them, but they are not officially part of Schengen. Some national laws have the text "countries against which border control is not performed based on the Schengen Agreement and the 562/2006 EU regulation",[93] which then includes the microstates and other non-EU areas with open borders.
