In the late 1990s, the developers of the ISO 9001:2000 standard—which addressed quality management systems and principles—debated whether or not to update the use of the word "continuous" to "continual".[8][9][10] ISO Technical Committee 176 and regulatory representatives ultimately decided that "continuous was unenforceable because it meant an organization had to improve minute by minute, whereas, continual improvement meant step-wise improvement or improvement in segments".[8] The committee reportedly did not base the change on dictionary definitions or the standard's vocabulary.[8] This change ran contrary to the common usage of "continuous" in the standard and other prior business management documentation.[9][11]
