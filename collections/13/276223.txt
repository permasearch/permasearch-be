From mid-2013 to early 2014, a challenge of unknown origin often called the "Cold Water Challenge" became popular on social media in areas of the Northern United States. The task usually involved the option of either donating money to cancer research or having to jump into cold water.[20] According to the Wall Street Journal, the Ice Bucket Challenge was begun by professional golfers as means to support various pet charities.[21][22]
