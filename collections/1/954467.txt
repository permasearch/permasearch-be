The reform era ended with the conservatives defeat of Iranian reformists in the elections of 2003, 2004 and 2005 â€“ the local, parliamentary, and presidential elections. According to at least one observer, the reformists were defeated not so much by a growth of support for conservative Islamist policies as by division within the reformist movement and the banning of many reform candidates which discouraged pro-reform voters from voting.[5]
