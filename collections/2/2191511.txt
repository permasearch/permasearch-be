The King passed the leadership of the government to a triumvirate of three conservative ministers, led by his Chancellor, Ren√© de Maupeou, who had been President of the Parlement from 1763 to 1768. Maupeou and two other conservative ministers, Abbot Terray for finance and the Duc d'Aiguillon for foreign affairs and war, took charge of the government. They became known as "The Triumvirate".
