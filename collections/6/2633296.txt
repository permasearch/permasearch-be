The East Coast of Australia, including Brisbane, South-East Queensland, far North NSW, the Northern Rivers and Sydney were battered by severe weather between 3 and 5 June 2016. Up to 200 millimetres (7.9 in) of rain fell across the entire coast, with 468 millimetres (18.4 in) falling in Wooli River Caravan Park near Grafton over 24 hours, and gusts of up to 125km/h hitting Newcastle and Sydney. Flash flooding along the coast was recorded as a result of the storms. For the first time in over 30 years, a severe weather warning and flood watch was posted for the entire 2,000 km NSW Coast. [28] More than 3,000 were received across NSW by 5 June, with 9,000 homes across Sydney and the Central Coast without power throughout Sunday. The deaths of 4 people across the coast have been attributed to the severe storms.[29] The system, stretching for nearly 3,000 km at its peak, was the result of two systems merging on Friday 3 June, developing into an East Coast Low.
