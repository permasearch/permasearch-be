Jewish law requires married women to cover their hair for reasons of modesty (tznius). Some women wear wigs, known as sheitels, for this purpose. Orthodox Jewish women such as the Ultra-Orthodox Haredi and Hasidic Jewish women will often wear human-hair wigs. Modern Orthodox Jewish women will usually wear a hat, but exposing the bottom of their hair. And, according to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, it is preferable for a married Jewish woman to expose her hair than to don a wig, for the wig actually increases attraction in the public domain and encourages the notion that Halakha is both irrational and intellectually dishonest.[15]
