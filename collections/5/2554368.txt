In 1982 and 1987, Harrison and Harrison enlarged the organ under the direction of the then abbey organist Simon Preston to include an additional Lower Choir Organ and a Bombarde Organ: the current instrument now has five manuals and 109 speaking stops. In 2006, the console of the organ was refurbished by Harrison and Harrison, and space was prepared for two additional 16Â ft stops on the Lower Choir Organ and the Bombarde Organ.[43] One part of the instrument, the Celestial Organ, is currently not connected or playable.
