Because it does not require two separate votes, IRV is assumed to cost less than two-round primary/general or general/runoff election methods.[73] However, in 2009, the auditor of Washington counties reported that the ongoing costs of the system were not necessarily balanced by the costs of eliminating runoffs for most county offices, because those elections may be needed for other offices not elected by IRV.[74] Other jurisdictions have reported immediate cost savings.[25]
