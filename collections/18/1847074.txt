This is a list of sources that each list metalloids: elements classified as metalloids. The sources are listed in chronological order. Lists of metalloids differ since there is no rigorous definition of metalloid (or its occasional alias, 'semi-metal'). Individual lists share common ground, with variations occurring at the margins. The elements most often regarded as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.[n 1] Wikipedia generally categorises these six as metalloids, with the addition of astatine. Other sources may subtract from this list or add a varying number of other elements.
