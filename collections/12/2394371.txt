This is not the only study that is at fault. Most of the studies that have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of technology in the classroom have used higher socioeconomic populations as their participants. The reason for this is that those are the schools that have already adopted widespread use of technology in the classroom. Some claim that using social media in the classroom is highly motivating for the students. Again, these studies are conducted on those who are already highly motivated. Also, Latino students and low-income students are underrepresented in these programs according to study done on Latino attitudes toward social networking for education (Howard et al., 2015). Although this information can be useful to assess that specific population, the findings cannot be generalized to those of lower socioeconomic status.
