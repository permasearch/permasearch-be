Before the introduction of the compass, celestial navigation was the main method for navigation at sea. In China, early versions of the magnetic compass were being developed and used in navigation between 1040 and 1117.[28] The true mariner's compass, using a pivoting needle in a dry box, was developed in Europe no later than 1300.[29][30]
