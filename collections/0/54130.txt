For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BCâ€“220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]
