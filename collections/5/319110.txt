At the genetic level, developmental studies have shown that repression of KNOX genes is required for initiation of the leaf primordium. This is brought about by ARP genes, which encode transcription factors. Repression of KNOX genes in leaf primordia seems to be quite conserved, while expression of KNOX genes in leaves produces complex leaves. The ARP function appears to have arisen early in vascular plant evolution, because members of the primitive group Lycophytes also have a functionally similar gene.[73] Other players that have a conserved role in defining leaf primordia are the phytohormones auxin, gibberelin and cytokinin.
