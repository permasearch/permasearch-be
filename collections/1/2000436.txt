One of the best ways to deal with observer biases is to acknowledge their existence and actively combat their effects. Using blind observers is an excellent technique. Observers are blind if they do not know the research hypotheses of the study.[2] If you actively avoid giving your observers reason to expect a certain outcome, expectancy effects are greatly diminished.
