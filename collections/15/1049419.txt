The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need is a book written by Andrew Tobias and concerns commonsense rules that the ordinary saver can live by. Published in 1978 and revised every few years since then, it predated other popular investment books like the Beardstown Ladies Investment Guide and Beating the Street by Peter Lynch of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. Along with Burton Malkiel's book A Random Walk Down Wall Street it helps ordinary readers see through the flim flam of investment marketing as well as being a sensible guide to personal finance.
