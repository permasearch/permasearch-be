On March 7, 1899, Phillip Garrigan, Vice Rector of The Catholic University of America, addressed the National Council, as the Supreme Convention was then called, asking for establishment of a Knights of Columbus Chair of American History at the university, to counter the somewhat anti-Catholic bias of history-writing at the time.[61] The convention enthusiastically accepted the proposal. By March 5, 1901, Supreme Knight Edward L. Hearn reported unhappily to the national convention that only $10,000 has been collected  of the $50,000 commitment made two years earlier. It would take an additional three years to collect the total amount.
