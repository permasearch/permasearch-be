Slant Magazine called this song "retro-dipped dance-pop."[1] Sputnikmusic marked it as a highlight and added: "It is not all slow and serious going though, as 1st single ‘Get The Party Started’ proves. As the song title suggests, this is the dance-oriented party-starter that the artist’s debut album lacked."[7] Stylus Magazine called this song "near perfection."[8]
