This Alusi was adept at bargains and trade, and praying to Ekwensu was said to guarantee victory in negotiations. As a force of change and chaos, Ekwensu also represented the spirit of war among the Igbo, invoked during times of conflict and banished during peacetime to avoid his influences inciting bloodshed in the community, warriors set up shrines to Ekwensu to help war efforts.[33] This is based upon the finding of old shrines dedicated to the worship of the spirit[55] as well as the recounting of old oral stories which depict the character of Ekwensu. Ekwensu was a bringer of violence and possessed people with anger.[42] Ekwensu holds the propensity of bringing misfortune and is regarded as an evil spirit in this sense.[33] Among the Christian Igbo Ekwensu is representative of Satan and is seen as a force which places itself opposite to that of Chukwu.[56] Ekwensu festivals are held in some Igbo towns where military success is celebrated and wealth is flaunted.[42]
