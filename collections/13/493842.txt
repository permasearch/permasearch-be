Edward's grandson, the young Richard II, faced political and economic problems, many resulting from the Black Death, including the Peasants' Revolt that broke out across the south of England in 1381.[60] Over the coming decades, Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne with the support of parliament in 1399.[61] Ruling as Henry IV, he exercised power through a royal council and parliament, while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity.[62] His son, Henry V, reinvigorated the war with France and came close to achieving strategic success shortly before his death in 1422.[63] Henry VI became king at the age of only nine months and both the English political system and the military situation in France began to unravel.[64]
