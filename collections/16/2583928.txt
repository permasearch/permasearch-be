No uncensored version of the song is available very easily, as the album which it appeared on censored all profanities (unusual since the film which it served as a soundtrack to had a lot of profanities, and was rated R). Also, Aaliyah's discography in general has been free of explicit lyrics. All profanities were replaced with typical ad libs from DMX songs, such as "what?" and "come on!". The US promotional CD single features the explicit version of the song.
