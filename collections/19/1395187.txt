Gus Pfender (Steve Kazee) is a recurring character in season 5. Gus is a bass guitarist for an indie rock band. Fiona meets him while working in the diner. They marry on an impulse. Gus goes on tour without Fiona because she has cheated on him with Jimmy. When he returns, Fiona has already moved on with Sean, infuriating him. When Fiona attempts to apologise and remain friends by going to his gig, he sings a humiliating song about her. To punish him, Fiona pawns his grandmother's engagement ring in order to get a mortgage to buy her home back. He returns some time later, asking for the ring and a divorce. Sean buys the ring back for him so they can finalise their divorce and he can propose to Fiona.
