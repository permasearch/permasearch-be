For color vision deficient pilots, in many cases these restrictions can be removed through use of an FAA approved alternative office based color vision test, which if passed, the applicant must continue to retake that same test (or any other passable tests) at every renewal.  If the pilot applicant is unable to pass any of the office based tests, a real world operational test is available.  This test consists of a ground-based chart reading and control tower signal light test for Third Class medical certification (This is called the Operational Color Vision Test or OCVT), and in addition to that, a specialized "Medical Flight Test" (MFT) is required for Second and First Class medical certification.  The applicant performs an actual flight test with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) for the purpose of further demonstrating "the ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties", which is the color vision requirement as written in the FARs.  Note that "Normal Color Vision" is not required, as a certain amount of color vision deficiency is considered safe and permitted.  If the tests are passed, a "Letter of Evidence" (LOE) from the FAA is issued, which serves as evidence that the pilot meets the standards for Color Vision and the AME is permitted to issue the class of Medical Certificate indicated on the LOE (All classes if both the OCVT and MFT are passed) with no related restriction if all other medical requirements are met.  This allows the pilot to receive a medical certificate with no restrictions related to color vision without the requirement of passing an office based color vision test at every subsequent renewal.[28]
