Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired Carpaccio's St Ursula in Venice, a vision of which, associated with Rose La Touche would haunt him, described in the pages of Fors.[141] In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited Sicily, the furthest he ever travelled.
