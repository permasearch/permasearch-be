Offensive coordinator Bob Gibson was the most frequent target of complaints. He had taken to the relatively nascent practice (now quite common) of calling all the plays from the upstairs press box. Pisarcik had often challenged Gibson about this, sometimes openly, over the past two seasons.[1] The players felt that Gibson should let Pisarcik call plays. They pointed out that during the previous week's loss to Washington, the team had attempted only three passes on several third-and-long situations during the game. They also felt insulted that on a third-and-7 in overtime, the coaches had called a run play.[1] Gibson for his part had limited confidence in Pisarcik's passing ability, an opinion widely shared (the media in New York referred to him as "off-Broadway Joe", a sarcastic reference to former New York Jets' quarterback, "Broadway Joe" Namath). He and other coaches pointed out that the three passing attempts the players pointed to had resulted in two interceptions and a sack.[1]
