On January 26, 1951, a price freeze was introduced.[14] From the onset of the war to the start of the price freeze, prices increased at a rate of 11.1 percent annually.[14] During the period from the price freeze to the end of price controls, prices rose at rate of 2.1 percent annually.[14] Overall inflation increased by 5.3 percent.[3] This inflation growth was much lower than that of World War II, during which wholesale prices increased about 70 percent.[5] While money growth was very high and volatile during World War II, averaging 18 percent between 1940 and 1946, the average money growth rate during the Korean War was 4 percent.[5] In response to this growth in inflation, the government implemented price and wage controls.[3] Increases in taxes and new price and wage controls that constrained private sector consumption and investment affected overall material well-being.[3] In the years after the war, consumption and investment continue to be impacted by war as they did not return to pre-war levels.[3]
