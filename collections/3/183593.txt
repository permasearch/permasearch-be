Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister after her party won the general election in 1979. Relations between President Carter and Prime Minister Thatcher during the year-and-a-half overlap of their leadership have often been seen as relatively cold, especially when contrasted with the kinship that Thatcher would subsequently develop with Carter’s successor Ronald Reagan.[104][105][106] However, Carter’s relationship with Thatcher never reached the levels of strain that Reagan's relationship would in the midst of the Falklands War.[107]
