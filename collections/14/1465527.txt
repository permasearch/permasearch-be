On February 6, 2014, a man carried out an illegal BASE jump from the highest point of the Peak 2 Peak Gondola and landed safely in the valley below.[21] In order to exit the gondola, he and a female accomplice had to pry open the doors causing an estimated $10,000 worth of damage.[22] They posted a video of the jump on YouTube as a tribute to Shane McConkey.[21] On February 13, 2014, the RCMP announced that they had arrested the woman and recommended charges of obstruction and mischief over $5,000.[22] One day later, BASE jumper Mike Douglas condemned the stunt saying "This guy seems to have gone about it in all the wrong ways. He caused a lot of damage in the process which I think is not cool."[23]
