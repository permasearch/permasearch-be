Vertically-oriented CNC machines utilize cylindrical cutters on a vertical spindle axis to create plunge cuts and drilled holes, as well as custom shapes, slots, and details on three-dimensional parts. Equipment used in this type of milling includes vertical lathes, vertical machining centers, and 5-axis machines.[6]
