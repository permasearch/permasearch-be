Prior to the 2014â€“15 season, Hockey Night in Canada was split regionally on various CBC stations. As of this season, it is now split with CBC Television, City, and selected Sportsnet channels. Before Sportsnet acquired national NHL broadcast rights, CBC Television used to have fixed broadcast teams. After Sportsnet acquired the rights to the quantity of nationally televised games have increased and there are no fixed broadcast teams. Sportsnet has mixed in its own broadcasters with some of the original crew and they all shuffle weekly for which Canadian market team they do play-by-play and colour commentary they do.
