Olaudah Equiano (c. 1745 – 31 March 1797),[5] known in his lifetime as Gustavus Vassa (/ˈvæsə/),[6] was a writer and abolitionist from the Igbo region of what is today southeastern Nigeria according to his memoir, or from South Carolina according to other sources. Enslaved as a child, he was taken to the Caribbean and sold as a slave to a captain in the Royal Navy, and later to a Quaker trader. Eventually, he earned his own freedom in 1766 by intelligent trading and careful savings. He was a prominent abolitionist in the British movement to end the Atlantic slave trade. His autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life Of Olaudah Equiano, published in 1789, helped in the creation of the Slave Trade Act 1807 which ended the transatlantic slave trade for Britain and its colonies.
