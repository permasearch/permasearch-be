An article in the New Times LA described Frusciante as "a skeleton covered in thin skin" who at the nadir of his addictions nearly died from a blood infection.[37] His arms became fiercely scarred from improperly shooting heroin and cocaine, leaving permanent abscesses.[27] He spent the next three years holed up in his Hollywood Hills home, the walls of which were badly damaged and covered in graffiti.[38] During this time, his friends Johnny Depp and Gibby Haynes went to his house and filmed a documentary short called Stuff, depicting the squalor in which he was living.[38] The house was eventually destroyed by a fire that claimed his vintage guitar collection along with several recorded tapes of music.[39]
