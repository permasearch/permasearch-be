In 1999, as an alternative to installing a translation system using the projected supertitles (or surtitles), an electronic titles system was installed in The Crosby Theatre. Invented by Figaro Systems of Santa Fe (and only the second one installed after the Metropolitan opera's MetTitles in 1995), the system provides small rectangular electronic screens in front of each patron's seat, showing a two-line translation of the sung text in either English or Spanish. The system has the possibility of handling up to six languages.
