In the southern hemisphere, particularly around the Hellas impact basin, are several flat-lying volcanic structures called highland paterae[45] These volcanoes are some of the oldest identifiable volcanic edifices on Mars.[46] They are characterized by having extremely low profiles with highly eroded ridges and channels that radiate outward from a degraded, central caldera complex. They include Hadriaca Patera, Amphitrites Patera, Tyrrhena Patera, Peneus Patera, and Pityusa Patera. Geomorphologic evidence suggests that the highland patera were produced through a combination of lava flows and pyroclastics from the interaction of magma with water. Some researchers speculate that the location of the highland paterae around Hellas is due to deep-seated fractures caused by the impact that provided conduits for magma to rise to the surface.[47][48][49] Although they are not very high, some paterae cover large areasâ€”Amphritrites Patera, for example, covers a larger area than Olympus Mons.
