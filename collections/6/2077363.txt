Although won by Democratic candidates in every election since 1992, sometimes by clear margins, in 2016 Michigan was considered a swing state and received much attention from Republican party candidate Donald Trump. Trump was able to win the state for the first time since George H. W. Bush won it in 1988, albeit by a narrow 0.23% margin of victory. On Election Day, in Michigan, Detroit Free Press had prematurely called the state for Clinton at 9:15pm before retracting the call 3 hours later[24], an error which had been common in many networks in the 2000 election, in the states of Florida and New Mexico.
