Ancient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through divination and ritual.[6] Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world.[6] During the Zhou Dynasty in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and temperance to preserve one's health.[6] The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient India focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life.[6] The Talmudic code created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets.[6] Other examples include the Mosaic Code and Roman baths and aqueducts.[6]
