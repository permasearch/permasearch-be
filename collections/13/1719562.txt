Moreover, Bastianich has worked with the Italian American Committee on Education (IACE), a New York-based non-profit organization that promotes the study of Italian language and culture, by visiting elementary schools and speaking to students as a guest speaker, such as in 2011 in Harlem [61] and in 2014 in the Bronx.[62] In 2014, Bastianich led the committee that determined the winners of a contest initiative launched by Eataly and IACE for students.[63]
