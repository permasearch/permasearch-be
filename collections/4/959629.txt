A number of tunnels leading into both Israel and Egypt were destroyed throughout the operation. There were reports that the tunnels between Gaza and Egypt were bringing an estimated $700 million into Gaza's economy through goods or services. Several Palestinians argued that the tunnels had been critical to supporting the residents of Gaza, either through the employment they provided or through the goods that they allowed inâ€”goods which were otherwise not available unless shipped through Egypt.[324] However, tunnels along the Israeli border serve a purely military purpose.[325]
