Jeep introduced several concept vehicles for its annual Easter Safari in Moab, Utah. One such vehicle was the Jeep Grand One, which was created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Jeep Grand Cheroke. This vehicle was based on a stock Stone White 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ Laredo 4X4 equipped with the 5.2Â L Magnum High-Output V8 engine and 46RH 4-speed automatic transmission, which the automaker purchased off of Craigslist specifically for the project. The Grand One was repainted a robin's-egg blue with a light woodgrain-style treatment underneath of the paint, paying homage to the 1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer ZJ, and the wheelbase was stretched to accommodate new front and rear axles (however, this is only noticeable if one looks at the slightly modified rear doors that had to be modified to accommodate the longer wheelbase). Large front and rear fender flares conceal the extended wheelbase. The Grand One also receives large, off-road capable tires, custom eighteen-inch laced aluminum-alloy wheels, a slight lift, an eight-slot gloss black-finished front grille, 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee-style 'GRAND CHEROKEE' emblems on the front doors and rear tailgate, and a new '5.2' emblem on the rear tailgate. Pinstripes on the side and rear of the body were removed, as was the textured side cladding, and the 'Jeep' emblem on the hood. Underneath the Grand One's hood, all components are stock Jeep except for a Mopar air filter and intake. Inside, the interior of the Grand One is mostly stock, except for new upholstery (the stock seats of the Grand One were re-wrapped in a modern gray leather-and-microfiber-suede with bright blue accent stitching), and a plaid headliner. Retro touches, such as the factory AM/FM radio with cassette player that has a cassette tape sticking out of the tape deck, an Audiovox car phone, and an original Nintendo Game Boy on the rear seat are eminent on the Grand One, paying tribute to the Jeep Grand Cherokee's history.[19]
