The length of time required to reach death could range from hours to days depending on method, the victim's health, and the environment. A literature review by Maslen and Mitchell[45] identified scholarly support for several possible causes of death: cardiac rupture,[46] heart failure,[47] hypovolemic shock,[48] acidosis,[49] asphyxia,[50] arrhythmia,[51] and pulmonary embolism.[52] Death could result from any combination of those factors or from other causes, including sepsis following infection due to the wounds caused by the nails or by the scourging that often preceded crucifixion, eventual dehydration, or animal predation.[53][54]
