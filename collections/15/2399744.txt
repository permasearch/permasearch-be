The Three Sisters are at the boundary of Lane and Deschutes counties and the Willamette and Deschutes national forests in the U.S. state of Oregon, about 10 miles (16 km) south of the nearest town of Sisters.[10] The three peaks are the third-, fourth-, and fifth-highest in Oregon,[11] and contain 16 named glaciers.[12] Their ice volume totals 5.6 billion cubic feet (160×10^6 m3).[13] The Sisters were named Faith, Hope and Charity by early settlers, but are now known as North Sister, Middle Sister and South Sister, respectively.[14][15]
