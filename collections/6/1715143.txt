The film was not listed on the schedule for San Diego Comic-Con International 2014, which raised questions on their absence by fans and the press.[51][52] Lionsgate announced on July 18, 2014, a week before the event, that the film would have a presence at the convention. Lionsgate partnered up with Samsung to debut the (including the viral videos which were considered 'teasers', third) teaser trailer on Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S at a special event on Friday, July 25, which was being hosted off-site at the Hard Rock Hotel. The partnership allowed Samsung users to view the trailer before the online release, download the first two movies for free as well as be given a free complimentary ticket to the movie.[53] On July 28, the teaser trailer officially debuted online through the movie's official Facebook page and YouTube account.[54][55] Within minutes, #MockingjayTeaserTrailerToday, #OurLeadertheMockingjay, and #OfficialTeaserTrailer became trending topics worldwide on Twitter. A full worldwide official trailer was released on September 15.[56] The final trailer was released on October 29 to mark the beginning of ticket pre-sales.
