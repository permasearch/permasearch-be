The reformatted version of the show originally made its debut on Syfy on February 23, 2010, replacing ECW, which concluded the previous week. A month after its premiere in April 2010, it was announced that SmackDown would move from MyNetworkTV to Syfy on October 1.[4][5] NXT aired its final episode on Syfy on September 28 to make way for SmackDown moving there on October 1 (albeit on Fridays as opposed to NXT's Tuesday timeslot) and began airing as a webcast at WWE.com for visitors from the United States from October 5 to June 13, 2012. It soon aired as a WWE Network exclusive from 2014, where it remains today.[6]
