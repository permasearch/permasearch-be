Kaymer and Watson advanced to the three-hole aggregate playoff, played on the 10th, 17th, and 18th holes. Watson nearly drove the green on the short par-4 and capitalized with a birdie to take the early lead; Kaymer missed a long birdie putt and made par. On the par-3 17th, Kaymer tied Watson by making a 15-footer for birdie while Watson missed a 45-footer and had to settle for par. Tied with one hole remaining, the playoff was now effectively sudden-death on the par-4 18th. Both hit their tee shots into the right rough, and Watson played aggressively; he went for the green on his second shot but it fell well short, into the creek in front of the green. With Watson in the hazard, Kaymer elected to lay up from his poor lie and only advanced the ball a little ways up the fairway on his second shot, and hit his third shot within 15 feet (5Â m) from the cup. After his drop from the hazard, Watson hit his fourth shot through the green into a bunker, but nearly holed the bunker shot for bogey that potentially could have extended the playoff. Kaymer's putt for par ended two feet (0.6 m) past and below the hole; he sank the bogey putt to win his first major championship.[19][20][21]
