In the 1990s, the Route 58 designation was officially removed from I-280 through Newark.[25][26]  In 2001, the state determined the Stickel Bridge over the Passaic River and its approaches were structurally deficient and was going to need to be replaced after sections of it were falling apart.[4][27][28] Instead of replacing the bridge, in 2007 the NJDOT decided to rehabilitate it at a lower cost.[4] Reconstruction of the bridge was completed in April 2009 at a cost of $33 million.[29]
