After ten years of standing in the spotlight, Celine Dion decided go on vacation. "I'm looking forward to having no schedule, no pressure, to not caring about whether it's raining or not, just visiting with family and friends, cooking at home, trying to seriously have a child. I want no pressure for a while," she said.[1] But before Dion embarked on her two-year respite from the music industry beginning 1 January 2000, she prepared All the Way... A Decade of Song to cap a ten-year period in which she has sold over 100 million records worldwide.[2] In the '90s, Dion has transformed herself from a regional Canadian success into one of the world's most successful pop artists. In that time, she's released seven English-language albums, from 1990's Unison to All the Way... A Decade of Song, and six newly recorded French albums, picking up numerous awards, including five Grammys.[1][2]
