In 1940, the Philippine National Assemble passed Commonwealth Act No. 570 declaring that the Filipino national language would be considered an official language effective July 4, 1946[21] (coinciding with the country's expected date of independence from the United States). That same year, the Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ (English: Grammar of the National Language) of grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced the 20-letter Abakada alphabet which became the standard alphabet of the national language.[22] The alphabet was officially adopted by the Institute for the Tagalog-Based National Language.
