A fundamental aspect of attachment is called basic trust. Basic trust is a broader concept than attachment in that it extends beyond the infant-caregiver relationship to "...the wider social network of trustable and caring others."[10] and "...links confidence about the past with faith about the future."[10] "Erikson argues that the sense of trust in oneself and others is the foundation of human development"[11] and with a balance of mistrust produces hope.
