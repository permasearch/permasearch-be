The overall propulsive efficiency (an extension of effective power (      P  E      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle P_{E}}  )) is developed from the propulsive coefficient (     P C    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle PC}  ), which is derived from the installed shaft power (      P  S      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle P_{S}}  ) modified by the effective power for the hull with appendages (      P  E  â€²     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle P'_{E}}  ), the propeller's thrust power (      P  T      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle P_{T}}  ), and the relative rotative efficiency.
