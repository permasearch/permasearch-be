During the United States participation in World War I the U. S. Food Administration was the responsible agency for the administration of the U.S. army overseas and allies' food reserves. One of its important tasks was the stabilization of the price of wheat on the U.S. market. It was established by Executive Order 2679-A of August 10, 1917, pursuant to the Food and Fuel Control Act.
