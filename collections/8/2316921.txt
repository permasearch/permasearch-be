The only single released off Baby Makin' Project was "Put a Little Umph in it" featuring Ashanti. It reached #49 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. The group recorded so much material for the project that they have saved eight of the tracks for another album, a release date for which has not been announced.
