The professional American football franchise now known as the Los Angeles Rams played in St. Louis, Missouri, as the St. Louis Rams from the 1995 through the 2015 seasons before relocating back to Los Angeles where the team played from the 1946 season to the 1994 season. The Rams franchise relocated from Los Angeles to St. Louis in 1995, which had been without a National Football League (NFL) team since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1988. The Rams’ first home game in St. Louis was at Busch Memorial Stadium against the New Orleans Saints on September 10, 1995, before the Trans World Dome (later the Edward Jones Dome, and now known as The Dome at America's Center) was completed for their November 12 game against the Carolina Panthers. Their last game played at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31–23. The Rams’ last game as a St. Louis-based club was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium, where they lost in overtime 19–16.
