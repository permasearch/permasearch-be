In the event of a Chief Minister's resignation, which conventionally occurs after an election or during a phase of assembly transition, the outgoing minister holds the informal title of "caretaker" Chief Minister until the Governor either appoints a new Chief Minister or dissolves the assembly. Since the post is not constitutionally defined, the caretaker Chief Minister enjoys all the powers a regular Chief Minister possesses, but is expected not to make any major policy decisions during his/her short tenure as caretaker.[3]
