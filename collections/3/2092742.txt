Oil's Well That Ends Well contains a rare instance where the Stooges break the fourth wall, and directly address the camera audience. Joe, after being chastised by Moe and told to sit down, turns around to the camera and mouths "I hate him!" to the audience before walking off-screen.[3] In addition, when Joe pulls the rope out from under Larry's feet and knocks him over, Larry's hat falls off his head. But in the next shot when Moe pulls him up to his feet, Larry is still wearing his hat.[1]
