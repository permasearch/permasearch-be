In February 1217, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements.[82] In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was the equivalent of a religious crusade.[83] This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour.[84] Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.[85][86]
