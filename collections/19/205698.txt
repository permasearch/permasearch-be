In the television movie Wonder Woman (1974) starring actress Cathy Lee Crosby, the island of the Amazons is shown briefly but not named. In line with comic book continuity of the time, the 1975–1979 Lynda Carter television series Wonder Woman did feature Themyscira but it was still called "Paradise Island" instead as Wonder Woman's home in several episodes. It was revealed in "The Feminum Mystique Part 2" (S1E5, 8 November 1976) that Paradise Island is located at 30° 22' N, 64° 47' W.  Paradise Island also appeared on the animated television series Challenge of the Super Friends, in the 1978 episode "Secret Origins of the Superfriends", and The All-New Super Friends Hour, in the 1980 episode "Return of Atlantis".[citation needed]
