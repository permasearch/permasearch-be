Beginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 Friends episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame.[124] These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011.[125] Netflix added all ten seasons of Friends in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.
