At the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the tournament semi-finals for the first time since 1987 where they lost 9–8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton.[94] The two teams met again in March 2012, where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which they did with a 16–9 victory.[95] This was followed immediately by an eight-match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations,[96] where Wales retained the Championship for the first time since 1979 wins.[97] Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost 23–19 to South Africa.[98]
