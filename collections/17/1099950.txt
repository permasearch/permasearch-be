The average bra size among North American women has changed from 34B in 1983 to a 34DD in 2012–2013,[86] and from 36C last year[when?] to 36DD in the UK during 2014–2015.[87] The change in bra size has been linked to growing obesity rates, breast implants, increased birth control usage, estrogen mimicking pollutants, the availability of a larger selection of bras, and women wearing better fitting bras.[86][88]
