FLAADS is part of a wider UK 'Complex Weapons' programme to deliver a variety of UK industry based weapons. FLAADS is intended to deliver a common weapons platform (the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM)) to equip forces in the air, land and maritime environments.[12][13] During the early stages of the FLAADS programme, requirements were identified for the new missile to meet the known and unknown air threats of not only the present, but those well into the future too. Thought was particularly given to meeting a target set "of complex airborne targets which are typified by high speed, rapid evasive manoeuvres, low signatures and advanced countermeasure[s]."[14]
