Known posterns are the Yedikule Kap覺s覺, a small postern after the Yedikule Fort (between towers 11 and 12), and the gates between towers 30/31, already walled up in Byzantine times,[85] and 42/43, just north of the "Sigma". On the Yedikule Kap覺s覺, opinions vary as to its origin: some scholars consider it to date already to Byzantine times,[107] while others consider it an Ottoman addition.[108]
