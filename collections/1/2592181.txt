In the early 20th century, Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance,[60] mainly due to many trade blockades and the world economic depression.[68] Before Mary Bruins Allison visited Kuwait in 1934, Kuwait lost its prominence in long distance trade.[60] During World War I, the British Empire imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because Kuwait's ruler supported the Ottoman Empire.[68][69][70] The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy.[70]
