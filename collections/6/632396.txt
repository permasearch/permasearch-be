In 1937 [8] Arpad L. Nadai suggested that yielding begins when the octahedral shear stress reaches a critical value, i.e. the octahedral shear stress of the material at yield in simple tension. In this case, the von Mises yield criterion is also known as the maximum octahedral shear stress criterion in view of the direct proportionality that exists between      J  2     {\displaystyle J_{2}}   and the octahedral shear stress,      Ï„  o c t     {\displaystyle \tau _{oct}}  , which by definition is
