In August, 2015, Brendon appeared on the Dr. Phil Show to discuss his recent arrests and alcoholism. However, he walked off soon after the interview began. Writing on Facebook about the interview he wrote "When I was in that seat, I felt that Dr. Phil went for the jugular, talking about some of my recent mistakes, with no build up," Brendon wrote. "I felt that he wanted me to lay the darkest parts of myself on national TV right from the start, and Iâ€™m not willing to do that."[39]
