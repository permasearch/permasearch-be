The activity site can bind either ATP or dATP.[31] When bound to ATP, RNR is active. When ATP or dATP is bound to the S site, RNR will catalyze synthesis of dCDP and dUDP from CDP and UDP. dCDP and dUDP can go on to indirectly make dTTP. dTTP bound to the S site will catalyze synthesis of dGDP from GDP, and binding of dGDP to the S site will promote synthesis of dADP from ADP.[32] dADP is then phosphorylated to give dATP, which can bind to the A site and turn RNR off.[31]
