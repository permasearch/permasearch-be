This carries on the long British legal tradition, which started with the Housing Act of 1875, that owners and/or occupiers may not put anyone in danger by their actions or inactions, and must act to protect their neighbours. If they fail to so, the local council's EHOs have a duty to consider taking appropriate legal action to protect the community at large. (Womack and Bone LLP)
