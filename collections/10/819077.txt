Economists have questioned whether Murabahah is "economically indistinguishable from traditional, debt- and interest-based finance." Since "there is principal and a payment plan, there is an implied interest rate",[279] based on conventional banking interest rates such as LIBOR. Others complain that in practice most "murabaá¸¥ah" transactions do not involve actual buying or selling of goods or commodities, but are merely cash-flows between banks, brokers and borrowers.[281]
