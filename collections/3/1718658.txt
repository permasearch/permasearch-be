Real estate development in the Persian Gulf by the United Arab Emirates and Oman raised concerns that habitats of species such as the kingfisher, hawksbill turtle, greater flamingo, and booted warbler may be destroyed.[66][67] The dolphins that frequent the gulf in northern waters around Iran are also at risk. Recent statistics and observations show that dolphins are at danger of entrapment in purse seine fishing nets and exposure to chemical pollutants; perhaps the most alarming sign is the "mass suicides" committed by dolphins off Iran's Hormozgan province, which are not well understood, but are suspected to be linked with a deteriorating marine environment from water pollution from oil, sewage, and industrial run offs.[68][69]
