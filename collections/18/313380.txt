According to two contradictory statements in the Los Angeles Times, West Coast Customs was founded in either 1994 or 1998[1] by auto enthusiast Ryan Friedlinghaus. In a 2008 article, USA Today put the foundation year as 1997.[2] The legal entity, West Coast Customs International, LLC, was incorporated in California on 20 October 2000.[24] A young Friedlinghaus had gotten his custom vehicles featured on the covers of auto magazines by age 14, but he became frustrated with the tedium of dealing with multiple specialty shops, which led to longer times to build the vehicles. According to Entrepreneur, this frustration, coupled with his love for custom cars, was what led to his opening of his own shop.[25]
