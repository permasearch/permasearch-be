Stephen Orgel describes Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 Romeo and Juliet as being "full of beautiful young people, and the camera and the lush technicolour, make the most of their sexual energy and good looks".[184] Zeffirelli's teenage leads, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, had virtually no previous acting experience but performed capably and with great maturity.[197][198] Zeffirelli has been particularly praised,[l] for his presentation of the duel scene as bravado getting out-of-control.[200] The film courted controversy by including a nude wedding-night scene[201] while Olivia Hussey was only fifteen.[202]
