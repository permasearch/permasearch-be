The Series II Land Rover launched in 1958 was larger, heavier and more complex than the original, and there was an ever-present need for higher powered engines.[12] Also, the Rover petrol engines in use at the time, with the archaic Inlet-Over-Exhaust valve layout and were approaching the age of 20 years in design terms. A new, larger petrol engine specifically developed for the Land Rover was needed.[13] The existing 2-litre diesel engine was used as a basis, but with a radically changed internal structure.[14] The new engine was a â€˜dry-liner' type, and a wider bore was used to improve low-speed torque output.[15] Despite the numerous changes the petrol engine could use the same machining line as the diesel, establishing a design commonly used between Land Rover's petrol and diesel engines that would survive for decades.[12][14] The 2.25-litre petrol was the most popular engine option right up to the mid-1980s and established a worldwide reputation for reliability and longevity.[12][16] The engine's relatively low compression ratio and general strong design made it tolerant of poor quality fuel and oil as well as infrequent servicing. With proper maintenance these engines can easily survive more than 250,000 miles of service. This was partly due to the commonality between petrol and diesel versions making the petrol version somewhat over-engineered for the job; they retained the extraordinary strength characteristics of the diesel while being much less stressed. The only major change to the design was the fitting of a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980, which improved bottom-end strength and refinement.[17] Despite its utilitarian origins, the 2.25-litre petrol is a quiet, smooth-running engine, and this enabled Rover to fit it to their P4 saloon car as the Rover 80.[18] Various power outputs were available for this engine depending on the compression ratio and the amount of emissions regulation equipment fitted.[12][19][20][21]
