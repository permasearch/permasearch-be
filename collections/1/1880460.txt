The Hall data analysis shows that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens.[88] Another study showed that 8% of both men and women's dreams have sexual content.[90] In some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions. These are colloquially known as wet dreams.[91]
