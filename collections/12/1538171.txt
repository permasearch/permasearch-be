Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Academi mercenaries also took part in the operation. Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia made their airspace, territorial waters and military bases available to the coalition.[19] The United States provided intelligence and logistical support, including aerial refueling and search-and-rescue for downed coalition pilots.[5][123] It also accelerated the sale of weapons to coalition states.[124] US and Britain have deployed their military personnel in the command and control centre responsible for Saudi-led air strikes on Yemen, having access to lists of targets.[125][126][127] Pakistan was called on by Saudi Arabia to join the coalition, but its parliament voted to maintain neutrality.[128] On 21 April 2015, the Saudi-led military coalition announced an end to Operation Decisive Storm, saying the intervention's focus would "shift from military operations to the political process".[129][130][131] The kingdom and its coalition partners said they would be launching political and peace efforts, which they called Operation Restoring Hope (Arabic: عملية إعادة الأمل‎‎ `Amaliyyat 'I`ādat al-'Amal). However, the coalition did not rule out using force, saying it would respond to threats and prevent Houthi militants from operating within Yemen.[131] Qatar is now not allowed to be a part of the team, because of the current crisis.[132]
