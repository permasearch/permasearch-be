Three area Catholic schools combined in 2003: Holy Angels, Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Mary. The school's Superintendent became Sr. Mary Jon Wagner. Originally the school's new name was to be Trinity Catholic School. Since then the entire school system has become Sandusky Central Catholic Schools, and the High School Campus has remained St. Mary Central Catholic.
