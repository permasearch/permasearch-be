On March 3, 2016, the band published an open letter announcing their ninth full-length studio album, True Sadness. In the letter, Seth Avett wrote, "True Sadness is a patchwork quilt, both thematically and stylistically."[46] The album, released on June 24, 2016, debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Top 200 and topped the U.S. Folk and U.S. Top Rock charts.[18] The album received a mix of positive and negative critical reviews. Entertainment Weekly praised the band's experimentation and "willingness to tear down boundaries"[47] while Pitchfork criticized the "baffling layers of synthesizers in what feels like a ploy to push the Avetts into clear Top 40 territory."[48] The album was nominated for two awards, as Best Americana Album and Best Americana Roots Performance (the album's lead single, "Ain't No Man"), at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[49] In October 2016, the band was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.[50] On January 31, 2017, it was announced that a documentary about the production of True Sadness, entitled May It Last: A Portrait of the Avett Brothers, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, would premier at the 2017 South by Southwest film festival.[51] The documentary was released on HBO on January 29, 2018.[52]
