The implementation using NPN type bipolar transistor is based on example from popular electronics hobby magazine. The circuit generates a sinusoidal wave at its output. The RC phase-shift network is used to form a positive feedback loop. Resistor Rb provides base bias current. Resistor Rc is the collector load resistor for the collector current. Resistor Rs isolates the circuit from the external load. The circuit is taken from [2]
