There is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity has influenced its current condition, as well as commenting on the problems and opportunities of tomorrow.[10] Donald Worster's widely quoted 1988 definition states that environmental history is the "interaction between human cultures and the environment in the past".[11]
