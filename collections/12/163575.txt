Although promoted by its publisher and initially described in media reports as a sequel to Lee's best-selling novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which was published in 1960, Go Set a Watchman is actually that novel's first draft.[2][13] The novel was finished in 1957[13] and purchased by the J.B. Lippincott Company. Lee's editor, Tay Hohoff, although impressed with elements of the story, saying that "the spark of the true writer flashed in every line",[13] thought it was by no means ready for publication. It was, as she described it, "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel". As Jonathan Mahler recounts in his Times article on Hohoff, she thought the strongest aspect of Lee's novel was the flashback sequences featuring a young Scout, and thus requested that Lee use those flashbacks as a basis for a new novel. Lee agreed, and "during the next couple of years, Hohoff led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird".[13]
