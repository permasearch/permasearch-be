In municipalities with a large population and states that do not support tract indices, the Grantor/Grantee method can be time consuming and difficult altogether due to common names within the index. In these municipalities, a geographic index is often created to aid in title searching. In this system, each document is posted in both a Grantor and Grantee index in addition to being posted to indexes describing attributes of the property's location such as a lot number, subdivision name or Parcel Identification Number (PIN). With a functioning geographic index, a search can be done with a combination of a Grantor/Grantee, Legal Description or PIN search.
