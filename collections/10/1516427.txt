Even with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight, about 50%.[5] Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve the weight. Since the per-carat price of a diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat (200Â mg) diamonds are the result of compromising Cut quality for Carat weight.
