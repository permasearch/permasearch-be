Before any attempt is made to start a vehicle engine, the vehicle's parking brake should be firmly applied and gear selection should be in Neutral (or Park). Any engine stop control should be returned to the run position and in cold weather, any 'excess fuel' starting aid should be set or used - such as Ki-Gass.
