Inspired by Lindbergh's flight and excited to have made his plane, the city of San Diego passed a bond issue in 1928 for the construction of a two-runway municipal airport. Lindbergh encouraged the building of the airport and agreed to lend his name to it.[17] The new airport, dedicated on August 16, 1928, was San Diego Municipal Airport â€“ Lindbergh Field.
