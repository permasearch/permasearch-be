George Eastham, who had previously been Waddington's assistant, was appointed as manager in March 1977,[60] but the club's slide into the Second Division in 1976–77 season proved unstoppable. Eastham did not last long, leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge.[61] The club's misery was compounded by a defeat to non-league Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup shortly afterwards.[62] Alan Durban, arriving from Shrewsbury Town,[63] was selected as the club's new manager in February 1978.[64] Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season, 1978–79, with a third-place finish.[49] After consolidating the club's position in the First Division, Durban left for Sunderland in 1981.[65]
