Page's guitar prowess is well demonstrated in different performances of the song from Madison Square Garden in July 1973, as seen in the group's concert films The Song Remains the Same (and accompanying soundtrack) and Led Zeppelin DVD. There is also a June 1972 live recording of "Since I've Been Loving You" which can be heard on the album How the West Was Won, and another live version on Disc two of BBC Sessions. The band performed the song during the 2007 Reunion gig in London's O2 Arena, and it is included the 2012 film of that historic concert, Celebration Day.
