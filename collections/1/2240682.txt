Although all people with abdominal gunshot wounds were taken to the operating room in the past, practice has shifted in recent years with the advances in imaging to non-operative approaches in more stable people.[33] If the person's vital signs are stable without indication for immediate surgery, imaging is done to determine the extent of injury.[33] Ultrasound (FAST) and help identify intraabdominal bleeding and X-rays can help determine bullet trajectory and fragmentation.[33] However, the best and preferred mode of imaging is high-resolution multi-detector CT (MDCT) with IV, oral, and sometimes rectal contrast.[33] Severity of injury found on imaging will determine whether the surgeon takes an operative or close observational approach.
