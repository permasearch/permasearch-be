LaMotta learned to box while in a reformatory in upstate New York, where he'd been sent for attempted robbery.[2] Afterward he fought undefeated in amateur bouts, turning professional at age 19 in 1941. During World War II, he was rejected for military service because of having had a mastoid operation as a child on one of his ears and it affected his hearing.[2][7]
