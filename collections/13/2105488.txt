Wrongfully shackled by McKinney, Stockdale joins a group of new United States Air Force draftees being transported to basic training. They include the obnoxious bully Irving S. Blanchard, who having undergone ROTC training, volunteers to be in charge. (Stockdale hears that Irving had ROTC and thinks it is a disease). They report to boot camp, where Stockdale and the equally dim friend, Ben Whitledge, begin the struggle to become airmen.
