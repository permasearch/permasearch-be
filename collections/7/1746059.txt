Royal Holloway's campus is set in 135 acres (55 ha) of woodland, between Windsor and Heathrow.[18] Around 200 species of shrubs, 150 different types of tree and numerous wild flowering plants can be found in RHC's parkland.[19] The nearest station is Egham. The campus is about 40–50 minutes[22] from Waterloo station in central London about 19 miles (31 km) away,[11] and Windsor is 5 miles (8 km).[14] The campus is 2 miles (3.2 km) from M25 junction 13 and close to the M3, M4 and M40 and London Heathrow Airport.[11] RHC's worst feature is considered to be that "Egham is not known for its social scene",[14] but it has been noted that the campus's environment "offers the best of both worlds – friendly and relaxed on the one hand, dynamic and busy on the other."[11]
