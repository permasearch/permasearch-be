Khalid led an assault and conquered Damascus on 18 September 634 after a 30-day siege. According to some sources, the siege is purported to have lasted some four or six months.[75] Emperor Heraclius having received the news of the fall of Damascus, left for Antioch from Emesa.  Khalid's cavalry attacked the Byzantine garrison of Damascus, which was also heading towards Antioch, catching up to them using an unknown shortcut, at the Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj,[76] 150Â km north of Damascus. Abu Bakr died during the siege of Damascus and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid from his command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah the new commander in chief of Islamic forces in Syria. Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalid's dismissal during the siege, but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered.[77]
