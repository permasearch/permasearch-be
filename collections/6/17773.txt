Parisian engineer and astrophotographer Thierry Legault, known for his photos of spaceships crossing the Sun (called occultation), travelled to Oman in 2011, to photograph the Sun, Moon and space station all lined up.[326] Legault, who received the Marius Jacquemetton award from the Société astronomique de France in 1999, and other hobbyists, use websites that predict when the ISS will pass in front of the Sun or Moon and from what location those passes will be visible.
