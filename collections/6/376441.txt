The term "democracy" first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of Athens during classical antiquity.[23][24] The word comes from demos, "common people" and kratos, strength.[25] Led by Cleisthenes, Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508â€“507 BC. Cleisthenes is referred to as "the father of Athenian democracy."[26]
