Income remains one of the main indicators of class, as it commonly reflects educational attainment as well as occupation.[7] A frequent distinction in political attitudes can be found among individuals residing in households with differing incomes.[5] For example, during the 2000 United States presidential election, voter turnout among those in the top 26% with household incomes exceeding $75,000 was 27% higher than the average.[43]
