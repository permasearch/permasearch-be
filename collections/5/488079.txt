Andrew Hacker (season 5) is Seeley Booth's boss and the Assistant Director of the FBI. In Season 5, he expressed a romantic interest in Brennan, to the consternation of Booth. He and Brennan dated several times, though nothing really developed from it. In one episode, he attempted to "rescue" Brennan, Booth, and their friends who were being held at the Jeffersonian by a group of mysterious government agents, only to arrive a few seconds after Booth had already subdued the agents â€“ much to Hacker's disappointment as he had hoped to impress Brennan.
