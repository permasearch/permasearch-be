The X-Files spawned an industry of spin-off products. In 2004, U.S.-based Topps Comics and[221][281] most recently, DC Comics imprint Wildstorm launched a new series of licensed tie-in comics.[282] During the series' run, the Fox Broadcasting Company published the official The X-Files Magazine.[283] The X-Files Collectible Card Game was released in 1996 and an expansion set was released in 1997.[284] The X-Files has inspired three video games. In 1998, The X-Files Game was released for the PC and Macintosh and a year later for the PlayStation. This game is set within the timeline of the second or third season and follows an Agent Craig Willmore in his search for the missing Mulder and Scully.[285] In 2000, Fox Interactive released The X-Files: Unrestricted Access, a game-style database for Windows and Mac, which allowed users access to every case file.[286] Then, in 2004, The X-Files: Resist or Serve was released. The game is a survival-horror game released for the PlayStation 2 and is an original story set in the seventh season. It allows the player control of both Mulder and Scully. Both games feature acting and voice work from members of the series' cast.[287] A 6-player pinball game, called The X-Files, was produced by Sega in 1997.[288]
