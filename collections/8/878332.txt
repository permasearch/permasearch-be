On August 6, 1984, Gardner escaped from custody at the University of Utah Hospital after faking an illness by vomiting. He attacked transportation officer Don Leavitt and forced him to unlock his shackles by telling him: "I guess you know if that doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both."[6][5] In the course of the escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face.[1] Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back.[5] On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, "Here's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital. I don't want to hurt no one else. I just want to be free."[1]
