Customers only need pay for the period of time where the receiver is active on the dish account, monthly cost for a Vip211k or Wally is $7 per month, if the receiver is the only one on the account, there is no charge.[33] It weighs ten pounds, is protected from weather, and automatically searches for a signal. The only satellites that are currently compatible with the Tailgater are at Dish's 119 (SD/HD TV), 110 (SD/HD TV), and 129 (SD/HD TV) orbital slots.[34]
