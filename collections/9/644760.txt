Sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide, used to manufacture cellophane and rayon.[24] One of the direct uses of sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber, where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers. Large quantities of sulfites are used to bleach paper and to preserve dried fruit. Many surfactants and detergents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate) are sulfate derivatives. Calcium sulfate, gypsum, (CaSO4Â·2H2O) is mined on the scale of 100 million tonnes each year for use in Portland cement and fertilizers.
