As almost all of the ACT's population lives in Canberra, political trends for both areas are closely aligned. The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory.[140][141] The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory.[141] In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two.[140] A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.[136]
