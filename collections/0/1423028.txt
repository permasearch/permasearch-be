In the summer between the first and second seasons Veronica and Duncan got back together on her 18th birthday. They stayed together until roughly the middle of the second season. Unbeknownst to Duncan, his previous girlfriend Meg Manning was pregnant before they broke up. Meg was on the bus that crashed at the beginning of the season, but survived comatose. She later died of a blood clot shortly after coming out of a coma. Their daughter was born just before she died. In order to prevent Meg's abusive parents from getting custody of his baby, Duncan decided to kidnap her and run away. Veronica helps him to do so and knowing that they can never speak to or see each other again, the two of them share a tearful farewell. Duncan does not appear again the series except for a brief cameo at the end of season 2 where he is now living in Australia and is at the beach with his daughter when his phone rings. He answers it, saying "CW?" (a joke about the show being moved to the then new network CW) and it's Clarence Weidman on the other end, who says "It's a done deal." in reference to the killing of Aaron Echolls, suggesting that Duncan was the one who arranged it as revenge for Aaron being acquitted over Lilly's murder.
