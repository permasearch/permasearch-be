The 27th Infantry Regiment consists of two battalions; the 1/27 and 2/27. While some might believe that there are actually two separate distinctive unit insignia (DUI),[who?] one for the 1st Battalion wolfhound unit crest which has the wolfhound facing to the left and 2nd Battalion wolfhound crest has the wolfhound facing to the right on the crest, the wolfhound crests are issued in pairs. While in a Class A uniform a coordinated pair of the two different crests is worn, one on each shoulder with the motto toward the shoulder seam and the head of the wolfhound facing forward.
