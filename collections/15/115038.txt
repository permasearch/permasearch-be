For the 39 post-season bowl games, teams should be bowl eligible to be selected. Normally, this requires a team to have a minimum of a 0.500 winning percentage. If there were not enough winning teams to fulfill all open bowl slots, teams with losing records could have been chosen in order to fill all 78 slots. Additionally, in the rare occasions where a conference champion does not meet eligibility requirements, they are usually still chosen for bowl games with tie-ins for that conference champion. For the 2017 season, no team with a losing record was chosen for a bowl game, and three bowl-eligible teams, including one with a winning record, were denied bowl bids.
