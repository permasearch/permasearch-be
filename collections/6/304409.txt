In plants, ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast.  The process is called photophosphorylation. The "machinery" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.[21] Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars.
