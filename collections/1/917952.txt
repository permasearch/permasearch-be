The producers eventually offered the role to Brosnan after a three-day screen-test.[5] At the time, he was contracted to the television show Remington Steele which had been canceled by the NBC network due to falling ratings. The announcement that he would be chosen to play James Bond caused a surge in interest in the series, which led to NBC exercising (less than three days prior to expiry) a 60-day option in Brosnan's contract to make a further season of the show.[6] NBC's action caused drastic repercussions, as a result of which Albert Broccoli withdrew the offer given to Brosnan, citing that he did not want the character associated with a contemporary TV series. This led to a drop in interest in Remington Steele, and only five new episodes were filmed before the show was finally cancelled.[7] The edict from Broccoli was that "Remington Steele will not be James Bond."[8]
