In December 2016, it was reported that Emmy Rossum had requested that she be paid more than William H. Macy for future seasons, to make up for previous seasons in which she was paid less than Macy. The pay dispute briefly delayed work on an eighth season of the series while she and Warner Bros. Television negotiated.[32] The dispute came to an end on December 14, when Rossum confirmed through Twitter that she would continue to work on the series, with production of an eighth season to begin in May 2017.[33] On December 19, 2016, Showtime officially announced that Shameless had been renewed for an eighth season.[34] Just days after the eighth season premiere, it was announced that the show had been renewed for a ninth, which would bring the show past the 100 episode mark.[35][36]
