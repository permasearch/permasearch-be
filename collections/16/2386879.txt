Lances were still in use by the British, Indian, French, Russian, Belgian, Turkish, Italian, Spanish and German armies at the outbreak of World War I. In initial cavalry skirmishes in France this antique weapon proved ineffective, German uhlans being "hampered by their long lances and a good many threw them away".[8] A major action involving repeated charges by four regiments of German cavalry, all armed with lances, at Halen on 12 August 1914 was unsuccessful.[9] Amongst the Belgian defenders was one regiment of lancers who fought dismounted.
