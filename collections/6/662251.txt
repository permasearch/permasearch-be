The decision to set the game four thousand years before Star Wars: Episode I â€“ The Phantom Menace was one of the first details about the game made known.[5] LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an Episode II game," BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before."[10] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom.[10] They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor.[11] Concept work had to be sent to "the ranch" to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with."[10] Zeschuk said that "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful."[11]
