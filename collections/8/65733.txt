The 2015 Call of Duty Championship marked the return of FaZe Red and FaZe Black. ACHES, SlasheR, Parasite, and Enable were transferred over from the main FaZe roster to FaZe Red. This time around, FaZe Red was much more successful, securing 3rd place at the 2015 North America Qualifier and at 2015 Call of Duty Championship. Following these placings, SlasheR and Enable were transferred back to the main roster, while ACHES and Parasite parted ways with the organization. FaZe Red had disbanded for good.
