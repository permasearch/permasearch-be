On Sunday, December 2, 2007, Trucco was involved in a car accident with a friend who was driving a Ferrari 360 on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California.  The vehicle flipped on an embankment, landing upside-down, impacting Trucco's side of the car.  Trucco was badly injured in the accident, fracturing four of his vertebrae, while his friend walked away uninjured.  He has stated that he initially lost feeling in his arms.  He was eventually able to get out of the vehicle after regaining feeling in his hands and used his cell phone to call for emergency help.  He was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center for a surgery and there were some complications although he made a full recovery. As of December 10, 2007, Trucco was out of the hospital and expected to make a full recovery. Doctors said he was extremely lucky, suffering almost the same injury as Christopher Reeve.[4]
