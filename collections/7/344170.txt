Bogel is a fat, dimwitted ghost while Weerd is a tall, skinny ghost. Weerd is the mastermind of the two. They both are recurring characters in the 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo and are first seen in the episode "To All the Ghouls I've Loved Before". Weerd comes up with a scheme to lure Shaggy and Scooby to open the Chest of Demons so he and Bogel can gain some glory with the 13 ghosts. In nearly every episode, Weerd and Bogel attempt to help out one of the chest escapees in fulfilling their master plan. Throughout the series, Weerd and Bogel try to get into S.A.P.S., a legion of high honor for the most terrifying ghosts and ghouls.
