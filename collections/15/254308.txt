According to The Statesman, the official government newspaper which usually played down the size of crowds at Gandhi's functions, 100,000 people crowded the road that separated Sabarmati from Ahmadabad.[43][44] The first day's march of 21 kilometres (13Â mi) ended in the village of Aslali, where Gandhi spoke to a crowd of about 4,000.[45] At Aslali, and the other villages that the march passed through, volunteers collected donations, registered new satyagrahis, and received resignations from village officials who chose to end co-operation with British rule.[46]
