Pre-production for New Moon began in December 2008.[50] Filming was scheduled to begin on March 23, 2009 in Vancouver,[5][6] but began a few days early.[7] Weitz envisioned a warm color palette for the sequel, contrary to the first film in the series, whose blue tones were prevalent.[51] His intention resulted in golden tones, a change that was inspired by Italian paintings, and ultimately served as the basis for the crew's collaborative work.[51] The approach also included the use of specific colors at certain points in the movie. For example, although Jacob's house is red, the color does not dominate until the climax of the movie. The director noted that, "The square becomes a flood of red, that's how conscious we were of every visual aspect."[52]
