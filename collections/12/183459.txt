We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effectsâ€¦ I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful."[133] After the release of Thor: The Dark World, Feige stated that the Infinity Stones would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.[134] In a separate interview for The Dark World in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,[135] referred to as the "Power Stone" by the Collector.[136][137] The mid-credits scene in The Dark World revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's aide, later named Carina.[69] In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.[138]
