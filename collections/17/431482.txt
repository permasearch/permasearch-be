In the multiplayer FPS ""Team Fortress 2" the core component of the story is that two rival brothers, Redmond Mann and Blutarch Mann, have been fighting for the properties granted to them by their father Zepheniah Mann for years, hiring different mercenaries to carry out the operations. This is similar to a family feud with the exception that it takes place in a single family.
