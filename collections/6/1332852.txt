There are several definitions of poverty, and scholars disagree as to which definition is appropriate for India.[27][28] Inside India, both income-based poverty definition and consumption-based poverty statistics are in use.[29] Outside India, the World Bank and institutions of the United Nations use a broader definition to compare poverty among nations, including India, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), as well as nominal relative basis.[30][31] Each state in India has its own poverty threshold to determine how many people are below its poverty line and to reflect regional economic conditions. These differences in definition yield a complex and conflicting picture about poverty in India, both internally and when compared to other developing countries of the world.[2]
