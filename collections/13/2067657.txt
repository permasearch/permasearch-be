After the war, ten Boom returned to The Netherlands to set up a rehabilitation center in Bloemendaal. The refugee houses consisted of concentration-camp survivors and sheltered the jobless Dutch who previously collaborated with Germans during the Occupation exclusively until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946, and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbruck, one of whom was particularly cruel to Betsie.[14] Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this time.[15]
