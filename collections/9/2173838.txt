The organism itself does not have to be completely cut into separate pieces for the regeneration phenomenon to be witnessed. In fact, if the head of a planaria is cut in half down its center, and each side retained on the organism, it is possible for the planaria to regenerate two heads and continue to live.[16] Researchers, including those from Tufts University in the US, sought to determine how microgravity and micro-geomagnetic fields would affect the growth and regeneration of planarian flatworms (D japonica). They discovered that one of the amputated fragments sent to space regenerated into a double-headed worm. In a first, an amputated worm regenerated into a double-head creature after spending five weeks aboard the International Space Station (ISS), scientists said.[17]
