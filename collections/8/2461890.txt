According to Latter Day Saint theology, all of material creation is filled with immanence, known as the light of Christ. It is also responsible for the intuitive conscience born into man. The Light of Christ is the source of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, and is the means by which God is in and through all things.[9] LDS scriptures identify the divine Light with the mind of God, the source of all truth and conveyor of the characteristics of the divine nature through God’s goodness. The experienced brilliance of God reflects the “fullness” of this spirit within God’s being.[10] Similarly, mankind can incorporate this spiritual light or divine mind and thus become one with God.[11] This immanent spirit of light bridges the scientific and spiritual conceptualizations of the universe.[12]
