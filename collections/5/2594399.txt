"Song for Athene" (also known as "Alleluia. May Flights of Angels Sing Thee to Thy Rest") () is a musical composition by British composer John Tavener with lyrics by Mother Thekla, an Orthodox nun, which is intended to be sung a cappella by a four-part (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) choir. It is Tavener's best known work,[1] having been performed by the Westminster Abbey Choir conducted by Martin Neary[2] at the  funeral service of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 6 September 1997 as her cortÃ¨ge departed from Westminster Abbey.[3]
