The role of Billie Reed was originated by actress Lisa Rinna. She first aired on September 18, 1992.[4][5] After three years, Rinna vacated the role on September 28, 1995. The show recast the role, which led to Krista Allen assuming the role from September 6, 1996 to November 5, 1999.[6] When Allen vacated the role, rumors arose that ex-Port Charles actress Julie Pinson would claim the role of Billie.[7] However, Rinna was announced to reprise the role for a short-term stint. Rinna returned to the role in July 3, 2002 and once again vacated in January 8, 2003. In 2004, two years following the online rumors, Pinson was hired into the role. She accepted after Rinna declined to return to the show.[8] Pinson debuted as Billie on September 13, 2004 and vacated the role four years later on February 5, 2008.
