In 468 BC the conflict continued into a third year. The Sabines marched through the territory of the Latin town of Crustumerium, ravaging the countryside. They progressed along the banks of the river Anio and came up to the Colline gate of Rome, then took off much bounty. The Roman army led by the consul Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus pursued the Sabines, and ravaged greater bounty from the Sabine lands. There was no major engagement between the opposing armies, however the war seems to have abated at this time.[17]
