The episode received a wide variety of mixed reviews from critics, ranging from largely negative to moderately positive. Matt Dougherty noted that "Get the Girl" returned The Office "to what it was before the Florida storyline, which is bad." Furthermore, he called the episode "the worst ... of the show simply because it lacked any form of logic or emotion."[12] He ultimately gave the episode a 2 out of 10 rating.[12] A review from Clique Clack called the main plot "miserably insufferable".[13] Other reviews were more mixed. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ rating.[14] A review from WHTC noted that the episode was "rather predictable, somewhat inconsequential, a bit silly and representative of perhaps a slight step back."[15]
