Eyjafjallajökull (Icelandic pronunciation [ˈeɪjaˌfjatlaˌjœːkʏtl̥] ( listen)), (English pronunciation: ei-ya-fyat-LA-yer-kitle), English Island Mountain Glacier,[2] is one of the smaller ice caps of Iceland, north of Skógar and west of Mýrdalsjökull. The ice cap covers the caldera of a volcano with a summit elevation of 1,651 metres (5,417 ft). The volcano has erupted relatively frequently since the last glacial period, most recently in 2010.[3][4]
