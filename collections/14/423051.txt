Janssen said the film is "definitely played with a bit of a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously."[13] Wirkola himself described it as "a little more grounded" and action-centered than Dead Snow.[26] He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it's just balancing it when you're cutting."[8] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out."[8] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback.[80] Wirkola said, "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always knew it was going to be R."[8] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well."[22] Wirkola said, "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio."[26] He said about the test screenings in particular: "I can see why they do it â€“ there's a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it's a flawed process, I really do."[9] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.[81]
