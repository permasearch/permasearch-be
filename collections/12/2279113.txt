Team challenge: One chef from each team must make a southern dish with the protein that was revealed in their selected dome. Their dishes will then be judged head to head by Ramsay and guest judge Chris Hastings. Koop sliced his fingers during the challenge, but was starting to feel nauseated while he was being treated by the medic. Because of this, he did not participate. The women won 3-2. In addition, Wendy's winning dish was featured on the menu in the next service.
