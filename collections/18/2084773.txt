Glynn accuses Sayre of making her sister a feminist heroine,[169] and Watson's The Double Helix as the root of what she calls "Rosalind Industry". She conjectures that these alleged sexism stories would "have embarrassed her [Rosalind Franklin] almost as much as Watson's account would have upset her",[165] and declared that "she was never a feminist."[170] Klug and Crick also concurred that she was definitely not a feminist.[171]
