In 70 BC, the praetor Caecilius Metellus fought successfully against the pirates which infested the seas around Sicily[40][41] and Campania,[42] who went on to plunder Gaeta and Ostia (69â€“68 BC)[43] and captured the son of Marcus Antonius Orator at Misenum. In the course of the subsequent war against the pirates in 67 BC, the sea around Sicily was assigned to Plotius Varus.[44][45] In 61 BC, Clodius was sent to the island as quaestor.[46]
