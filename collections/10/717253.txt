The Islanders for the first series were revealed on 2 June 2015, just days before the launch.[11] However, throughout the series, more Islanders entered the villa to find love. Some Islanders were dumped from the island for either failing to couple up, some were voted off by their fellow Islanders, and others for receiving the least votes in public eliminations. The series was won by Jess and Max on 15 July 2015 after receiving 42% of the final vote, beating Hannah and Jon who received 36%, Lauren and Josh with 12%, and finally Cally and Luis who just received 10%.[12]
