The Center for Public Integrity which wrote the reply "biggest debunker debunked", with respect Morgan's preliminary analysis of Hinkley in 2013, which concluded that no cancer cluster exists, has itself also stated and recognized "that science cannot say one way or the other whether some residents’ cancers were tied to the low levels of chromium 6. Statistical studies “aren’t capable of detecting whether a few extra people in a community got cancer from exposure to a toxic chemical."[47] With this matter not being isolated to Hinkley but to the entire field of epidemiology, the conservative linear no-threshold approach to public safety and the related "as low as reasonably practicable" approach that likewise informs "maximum premissable safety limits", on everything from the hazards of sunlight exposure to Chromium-6 in water, in which statistical significance, "the smoking gun" that scientists look for, frequently does not exist when a substance is administered at very low doses/chronic low dose rates below the Ames test level and this problem is further compounded when the "exposure" isolated to a small sample size of individuals in a community.[47] Both industry and the lawyers who bring cases against them, have a history of exploiting this scientific uncertainty, this intersection of science and what are ultimately political decisions on "maximum limits", to support their position.[48]
