In Britain and Ireland, cod and haddock appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips,[39] but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock or coley, plaice, skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear most commonly in 'fish suppers'â€”'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips.[citation needed] Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock.[40]
