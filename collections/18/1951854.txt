Bell began dating actor Dax Shepard, also from Detroit in late 2007. The couple announced their engagement in January 2010.[60] They decided to delay marriage until the state of California passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.[61] They co-starred in the 2010 film When In Rome, the 2012 film Hit and Run,[62] and the 2017 film CHiPs. After section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act fell on June 26, 2013, Bell asked Shepard to marry her through Twitter,[63] which he accepted.[64] They were married at the Beverly Hills County Clerk's Office on October 17, 2013.[65] They have two daughters: Lincoln Bell Shepard (born March 28, 2013)[66] and Delta Bell Shepard (born December 19, 2014).[67]
