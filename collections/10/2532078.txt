The earliest documented origins of actual physical therapy as a professional group date back to Per Henrik Ling, "Father of Swedish Gymnastics," who founded the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics (RCIG) in 1813 for manipulation, and exercise. The Swedish word for physical therapist is sjukgymnast = someone involved in gymnastics for those who are ill. In 1887, PTs were given official registration by Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare. Other countries soon followed. In 1894, four nurses in Great Britain formed the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.[12] The School of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago in New Zealand in 1913,[13] and the United States' 1914 Reed College in Portland, Oregon, which graduated "reconstruction aides."[14] Since the profession's inception, spinal manipulative therapy has been a component of the physical therapist practice.[15]
