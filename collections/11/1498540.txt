The site core of Calakmul covers an area of approximately 2 square kilometres (0.77 sq mi), an area that contains the remains of roughly 1000 structures.[7] The periphery occupied by smaller residential structures beyond the site core covers an area of more than 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi) within which archaeologists have mapped approximately 6250 structures.[7] Calakmul matches the great city of Tikal in size and estimated population, although the density of the city appears to have been greater than that city.[7]
