Trump did not release his personal income tax returns, as nominees traditionally do, and said he does not plan to do so before the November election.[699] Historians say he would be the first major party nominee since 1976 not to make his tax returns public. Before declaring for president he said he would "absolutely" release them if he decided to run for office.[700] Early in the 2016 primary process he promised to put out "very big, very beautiful" returns.[700] He offered various reasons for not giving out the information. He says his lawyers told him not to release the returns because they are being audited. He contends that voters are not interested and "there's nothing to learn from them". He told one interviewer that his tax rate is "none of your business".[700]
