Auburn and UCLA were initially slated to play in 2010, but Auburn officials later backed out of the offer. ABC attempted to replace Auburn with Georgia Tech, but the switch prompted UCLA to opt out entirely because the game would essentially be a home game for the Atlanta-based Yellow Jackets, with no scheduled return trip to Los Angeles.[2][3] Finally, an agreement was reached in which LSU and North Carolina would match up. The 2010 game also saw the introduction of a trophy awarded to the winner, the Old Leather Helmet.[4]
