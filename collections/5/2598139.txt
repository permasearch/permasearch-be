Since Rehnquist's first years on the Supreme Court, other justices criticized what they saw as his "willingness to cut corners to reach a conservative result", "gloss[ing] over inconsistencies of logic or fact" or distinguishing indistinct cases to reach their destination.[55][56] In Jefferson v. Hackney, for example, Douglas and Justice Thurgood Marshall charged that Rehnquist's opinion "misrepresented the legislative history"[57] of a federal welfare program.[58] Rehnquist did not correct what The Brethren characterizes as an "outright misstatement,Â ... [and thus] publish[ed] an opinion that twisted the facts".[57] Rehnquist's "misuse" of precedents in another case "shocked" Justice John Paul Stevens.[59] For his part, Rehnquist was often "contemptuous of Brennan's opinions", seeing them as "bending the facts or law to suit his purposes".[60]
