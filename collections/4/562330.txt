On the northern, rear facade, there is a wing that projects from the eastern half of the house consisting of four bays. The roof is hipped and has two gabled dormers on all three sides of the wing that indicates a finished attic level. There are brick exterior chimneys at the rear and east elevations of the wing, which has 6/9 windows at both levels. There are two further projections from the rear wing. A small one-story brick wing on the north elevation, with hipped roof and exterior chimney, was originally used for farm-related storage. At the rear bay of the east elevation is a one-story, one-by-one bay frame wing, with a slate gable roof and exterior brick chimney attached to the house as an office. This small structure predates the main house, and was relocated, attached and re-sided.
