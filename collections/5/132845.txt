Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information "hub" on Android devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen.[68] A homescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth.[69] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen,[70] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.[71] Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.[72]
