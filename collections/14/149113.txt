In music theory, the leading-tone seventh chords are viiÃ¸7 and viio7 (Benward and Saker 2003, 218-9), the half-diminished and diminished seventh chords on the seventh scale degree, or leading-tone, in major and harmonic minor, resolving to the tonic. Leading-tone triads and seventh chords are frequently substituted for dominant chords, with which they have three common tones, for variety (Benward and Saker 2003, 217).
