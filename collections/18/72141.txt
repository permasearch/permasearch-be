Although kudzu prefers forest regrowth and edge habitats with high Sun exposure, the plant can survive in full sun or partial shade.[4][6] These attributes of kudzu made it attractive as an ornamental plant for shading porches in the southeastern United States, but they facilitated the growth of kudzu as it became a "structural parasite" of the South,[6] enveloping entire structures when untreated[10] and often referred to as "the vine that ate the South".[12]
