During its original broadcast, the episode "Jerry's Painting" ran for an extended 40 minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes because it followed "Goodbye, Michael", an extended episode of The Office that featured the final appearance of Steve Carell as a regular cast member.[86][87] "The Fight" and "Road Trip" ran back-to-back during their original broadcast on May 12, 2011,[37] as did "The Bubble" and "Li'l Sebastian" on May 19.[88] The four were stand-alone episodes that were not originally designed to be shown together,[58] However, because the third season premiered late as a mid-season replacement in January, the episodes aired together so the series' season would conclude at the end of the television season.[73][89]
