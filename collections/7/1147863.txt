The evacuation of the settlers was completed by 22 August, after which demolition crews razed 2,800 houses, community buildings and 26 synagogues.[41] Two synagogues, whose construction allowed for them to be taken apart and reassembled, were dismantled and rebuilt in Israel. The demolition of the homes was completed on September 1, while the Shirat HaYam hotel was demolished later.[42]
