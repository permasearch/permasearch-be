The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems that achieved worldwide popular usage starting in the 1980s.[9][10][11] The master patent for the photophone (U.S. Patent 235,199 Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone) was issued in December 1880,[5] many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.
