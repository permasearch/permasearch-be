Economist Roger Middleton states that economic historians generally agree on 1950 as the start date for the golden age,[4] while Robert Skidelsky states 1951 is the most recognized start date.[5] Both Skidelsky and Middleton have 1973 as the generally recognized end date, though sometimes the golden age is considered to have ended as early as 1970.
