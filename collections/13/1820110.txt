Joint injection of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months.[95] Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis,[96][97] but did increase risk of further pain.[96] In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear.[98] The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk.[vague][99][100]
