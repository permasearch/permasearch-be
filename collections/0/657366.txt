A Toronto group had plans to bring the Buffalo Bills to Toronto to play an exhibition game at Exhibition Stadium in 1988,[9] with hopes that it would become an annual event.[10][11] However, following objections from CFL Commissioner Douglas Mitchell[12][13] the game was vetoed by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle.[9][14] The group would unsuccessfully continue to try to arrange a game for a future season.[10] In 1993 the Cleveland Browns hosted one of their pre-season games in Toronto, which was organized by Molson Brewery, due to a scheduling conflict at Cleveland Stadium with the Cleveland Indians.[15] As early as 1994 the Bills were considered hosting some of their regular season home games in Toronto, with SkyDome officials actively attempting to organize a regular season NFL game at the new stadium.[16][17][18] When the NFL reached a five-year partnership agreement with the CFL in 1997, which included a $3 million loan to the Canadian league, the NFL received the CFL's blessing to hold an annual preseason or regular season game in either Toronto or Vancouver for the duration of the agreement.[19] The Bills played in two pre-season American Bowls in Toronto in 1995 and 1997, organized by Paul Godfrey, in an attempt to prove the city's worthiness to host a franchise permanently.[20] The Argos received $300,000 from the organizers to waive their exclusivity on football at the stadium for the game in 1995.[21] In 2000 the NFL announced that SkyDome would host American Bowls in 2001 and 2003,[22][23] but the games ultimately never took place, with the 2001 game being scrapped due to a lack of high-profile teams willing to participate.[24] A planned game featuring the Chicago Bears in the 2002 season was called off in part due to the poor state of the artificial turf at the SkyDome.[25][26]
