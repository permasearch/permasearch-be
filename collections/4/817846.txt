As a consequence of the war and especially Soviet occupation, Central European countries found themselves under the "Soviet sphere of influence" (as agreed upon at the Yalta Conference). Immediately following the war, Soviet style totalitarian regimes were established in all of these countries and any forms of liberal democracy that existed before the war were erased. For the countries of Central Europe installation of Stalinist dictatorships meant the decline of their economies and more significantly, a loss of national sovereignty and unique global identity until the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1989 (see also "the Velvet Revolution").
