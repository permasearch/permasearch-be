While Christmas shopping at the mall, Miley meets Connor, a cute guy who is considerably shorter than she. She accepts his offer for a date only to spend it inadvertently yet repeatedly referencing their height differences. He ends the disastrous evening when Miley cannot bring herself to kiss him, leaving her feeling shallow yet determined to get a second chance with him. Meanwhile, Jackson and Robby bend over backwards to please their neighbor, Mr. Dontzig, in exchange for a letter of recommendation to help Jackson get into his desired college.
