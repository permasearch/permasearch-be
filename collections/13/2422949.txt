In ancient many dugouts were made from linden wood, for several reasons. First, was abundant in the Paleolthic after the melting of the Weichselian glaciation and readily available. Secondly it grew to be one of the tallest trees in the forests of the time, making it easier to build longer boats. Linden wood also lends itself well to carving and doesn't split or crack easily. It is lighter and therefore boats made from it have a better cargo capacity and are easier to carry, than most other tree types from the European old-growth forests.
