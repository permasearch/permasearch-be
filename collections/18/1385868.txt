An example of a DOM-based XSS vulnerability is the bug found in 2011 in a number of JQuery plugins.[20] Prevention strategies for DOM-based XSS attacks include very similar measures to traditional XSS prevention strategies but implemented in JavaScript code and contained in web pages (i.e. input validation and escaping).[21] Some JavaScript frameworks have built-in countermeasures against this and other types of attack â€” for example Angular.js.[22]
