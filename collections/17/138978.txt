Some sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford[19]) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.[20][21] Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were – following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison – accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly, the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.[22] Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that "even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account."[23]
