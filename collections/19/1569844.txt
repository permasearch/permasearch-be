The ileocecal valve (ileal papilla, ileocaecal valve, Tulp's valve, Tulpius valve, Bauhin's valve, ileocecal eminence, valve of Varolius or colic valve) is a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine.[1] Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum.[2] Approximately two litres of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve.
