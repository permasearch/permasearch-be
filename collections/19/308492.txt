The same day, the President signed into law[30] a requirement that "In God We Trust" be printed on all U.S. currency and coins.  On paper currency, it first appeared on the silver certificate in 1957, followed by other certificates.  Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes were circulated with the motto starting from 1964 to 1966, depending on the denomination.[20][31] (Of these, only Federal Reserve Notes are still circulated.)
