I’d like to begin by saying to my colleague from Texas that there isn’t a single member on this side of the aisle that belongs to the 'Democrat Party'. We belong to the Democratic Party. So the party you were referring to doesn’t even exist. And I would just appreciate the courtesy when you’re referring to our party ... to refer to it as such.[44]
