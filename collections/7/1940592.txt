The layout of a ripple-carry adder is simple, which allows fast design time; however, the ripple-carry adder is relatively slow, since each full adder must wait for the carry bit to be calculated from the previous full adder. The gate delay can easily be calculated by inspection of the full adder circuit. Each full adder requires three levels of logic. In a 32-bit ripple-carry adder, there are 32 full adders, so the critical path (worst case) delay is 3 (from input to carry in first adder) + 31 Ã— 2 (for carry propagation in latter adders) = 65 gate delays.[3] The general equation for the worst-case delay for a n-bit carry-ripple adder, accounting for both the sum and carry bits, is
