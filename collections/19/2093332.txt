Eventually the secret of Tom's birth is revealed, after a brief scare involving Mrs Waters; Mrs. Waters is really Jenny Jones, Tom's supposed mother, and Tom fears that he has committed incest. However, this is not the case, as Tom's mother is in fact Bridget Allworthy, who conceived him after an affair with a schoolmaster â€” therefore, Tom is truly Squire Allworthy's nephew. After finding out about the intrigues of Blifil (who is Tom's half-brother), Allworthy decides to bestow most of his inheritance to Tom. After Tom's true parentage is revealed, he and Sophia marry, as Squire Western no longer harbours any misgivings over Tom marrying his daughter. Sophia bears Tom a son and a daughter, and the couple live on happily with the blessings of Squire Western and Squire Allworthy.
