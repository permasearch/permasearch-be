Rear Admiral Ruddock returned on 30 November and continued her operations off Leyte until 2 December, when the battleship headed for Palau. Flagship of a new task force, she proceeded toward the Sulu Sea to cover the landings on Mindoro.[32] Entering Leyte Gulf late in the evening of 12 December, she entered the Surigao Strait the next day and steamed into the Sulu Sea with a carrier force to provide cover for the transports. The battleship covered the retirement of the transports on 16 December, refueling in Leyte Gulf before returning to Kossol Roads (where she spent Christmas) at midday on 19 December.[6][31]
