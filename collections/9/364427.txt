The Puritans were well prepared and well born; among their number was landed gentry and educated aristocrats. In the area of education, New England differed from its mother country, where nothing in English statute required schoolmasters or the literacy of children. The Puritan model of education in New England was unique, with the possible exception of Scotland. John Winthrop claimed in 1630 that the society which they would form in New England would be "as a city upon a hill,"[54] and the colony leaders would educate all. These were men of letters. Hampton's founder, the Reverend Stephen Bachiler, had graduated from Oxford, others had attended Cambridge. These men had communicated with intellectuals and aristocrats from all over Europe. In 1636, they founded the school that soon became Harvard College.[55]
