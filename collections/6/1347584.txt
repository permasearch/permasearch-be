Alternatively, "hibachi-style" is often used in the United States as a term for Japanese teppanyaki cooking, in which gas-heated hotplates are integrated into tables around which many people (often multiple parties) can sit and eat at once. The chef performs the cooking in front of the diners, typically with theatrical flairâ€”such as lighting a volcano-shaped stack of raw onion hoops on fire.
