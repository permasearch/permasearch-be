Wolfram, in a last attempt, uses the invention to amplify his power and starts to overcome an already tired All Might, creating a giant body made up of metal parts and debris that traps David inside it. He overpowers All Might further with multiple Quirks and reveals that he is in league with All for One, who gave Wolfram additional Quirks and helped fuel David's fall from grace in an attempt to demoralize All Might. The rest of the students soon arrive on the roof to help All Might, and Midoriya and All Might work together to finish the fight. The two throw a final punch together that is ultimately strong enough to defeat Wolfram and free David. As the sun rises, David and All Might reflect on how Melissa and Midoriya are the next generation of heroes and how the world will be in good hands even after All Might's Quirk is gone.
