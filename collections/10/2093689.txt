Much of St. Elizabeths' campus has now fallen into disuse and is in serious disrepair. It has been named one of the nation's 11 Most Endangered Places in 2002 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[21] Access to many areas of the campus, including the abandoned western campus (which houses the Center Building) is restricted.[18]
