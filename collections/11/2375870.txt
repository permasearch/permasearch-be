Everything about Kannazuki no Miko says instant fan favorite, but somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Changes in scene and mood don't seem to connect, characters behave without rhyme or reason, and even thrilling action scenes are hampered by sloppy animation. There are lots of little things to like about the series, but as a whole, you have to wonderâ€”"What? That's it?" ... If Kannazuki no Miko were split into two different series, it might be easier to enjoy the separate story threads.[8]
