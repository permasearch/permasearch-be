When in the children's park, Stewie quotes "Did ya get me my Cheez Whiz, boy" and a man throws one to him, this is a reference to The Blues Brothers.[3] Stewie and Brian attempting to find diversity in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue is a reference to the children's book series Where's Wally?,[5] as well as to a lawsuit alleging a lack of diversity in Abercrombie and Fitch's hiring practices. Before the battle between  Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says "On my signal, unleash hell." This is a reference to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts.[3] When Stewie invades Bertram's camp at the end of the episode Bertram quotes Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, repeating the line Darth Vader says when he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star.  When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite.  When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters.  Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors.[6] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens.  A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story in which Ben Stiller does the same thing in his fatsuit.
