The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most countries on September 7, 2016 when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32Â GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[3][22] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[23] and Canada in July 2017.[24]
