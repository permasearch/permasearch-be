The consensus view among guidance advisors is that it is a good idea to visit colleges,[121] preferably when college is in session and not during a summer break,[122] with a chance to meet an actual student in the form of a tour guide,[123] and taking notes for reference later when applying.[121][124] Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit.[125] A benefit is seeing a school as it really isâ€”not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website.[73] Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: "can I see myself here"?[126] Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and try to meet with them briefly or sit in on one of their classes.[124] Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask good questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper.[121] He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly.[121] A follow-up "thank you" note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.)[121]
