In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts.[20] The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often Socratic, typically with small classes, and often has a lower student-to-teacher ratio than at large universities; professors teaching classes are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than primary research professors or graduate student teaching assistants in universities.[citation needed]
