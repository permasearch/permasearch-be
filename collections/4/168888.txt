In a short film to bridge the events of The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious, Brian is shown to have surrendered his gun and badge at his home in LA, escaping as a SWAT team raids his house. He goes on the run in a red Mitsubishi 3000GT, earning money via street racing. Losing the Mitsubishi when he's forced to abandon it after police officers recognize the vehicle, he replaces it with a used Nissan Skyline that he repairs and restores with money he earns from subsequent races. He ultimately ends up in Miami, setting the stage for the second film.
