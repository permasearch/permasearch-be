Magic itself often manifests as a puff of smoke or sparkling dust, which can vary in colors, depending on the practitioner; possibly the differing colors may be due to whatever color the person favors most. Zelena's magic was green initially because of her envy, but she later starts favoring the color green. Emma's magic is white, due to her being the Savior and the product of her parents' true love; it changed to yellow after the darkness possessed her. While a Dark One, Hook's magic was red, which symbolized his bloodlust towards Rumplestiltskin. Purple seems to be the most common color for the smoke manifestation of magic in general. The color varies according to the wielder and/or the form of magic: for instance, most of the time a person sticks to one color no matter their location (although there are certain instances where, due to unknown reason, their magic color is different). Furthermore, the Dark Curse manifests as a very large black cloudy storm in shades of purple and green. In the episode "Kansas", Regina's magic changed from purple to white because she was able to use light magic only at that moment to stop Zelena.
