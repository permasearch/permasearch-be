Several causes can lead to pyramiding, including excessive animal or vegetable protein; inadequate calcium, sunlight, and/or vitamin D3; and excessive moisture / poor nutrition foods. Once pyramiding has occurred, it cannot be reversed, though if the underlying problem is corrected, the animal may still lead a long, healthy life.
