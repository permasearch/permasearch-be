Sofia makes the mistake of telling Amber the secret of her amulet. Amber becomes jealous and selfishly takes it without permission and tries to use it to summon a Disney Princess. Unfortunately, taking the amulet and betraying Sofia both count as a bad deed, so it bestows a curse on Amber by summoning the venomous Princess Ivy, an exiled evil princess who plans to usurp the throne and turn all Enchancia black and white.
