The JA60 was propelled by a 5.6 L VK56DE V8 engine (320 hp [227 kW] @ 4,900 rpm and 393 lb·ft (533 N·m) torque @ 3,600 rpm) and a 5-speed automatic transmission with an overdrive. As is common with aluminum blocks, each cylinder in the engine was lined with cast iron. The valvetrain was a DOHC design with four valves per cylinder. Infiniti designed the QX56's throttle responsiveness to correspond to specific drivetrain modes: when the driver selects all-wheel drive, the throttle becomes less sensitive, presumably to allow easier regulation of acceleration when off-road.
