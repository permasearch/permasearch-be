Serbian New Year's celebrations take place in Belgrade, and several other major cities such as Novi Sad and Ni≈°. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the influence of the Julian calendar. Throughout the region, especially amongst former Yugoslav republics, Belgrade is the most popular destination for major parties.
