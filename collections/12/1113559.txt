The ideal habitat for monarchs migrating north from Mexico sites to Texas and Oklahoma is less studied. Presumably, tailwinds assist the migration north. Rainfall is critical in creating the ideal habitat for the returning monarchs which must have abundant, lush and healthy food plants available for larvae. Ideal growth of larval plants that emerge in succession as the breeding butterflies migrate north, is also critical. Drought is a big factor influencing the emergence of food plants.
