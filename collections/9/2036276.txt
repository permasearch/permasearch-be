In February 2005, Remo collaborated with Jethro Tull along with renowned Indian percussionist Sivamani, for a concert held in Dubai. They performed tracks such as Mother Goose, Locomotive Breath, and Remo's now very famous Flute Kick also informally called "the flute song". Jethro Tull also backed Remo as he sang his own 'Bombay City' and 'Maria Pita Che'.
