Taking into account all these criteria and conditions, the DFB executive committee selected the final 10 cities and stadia as candidate venues from the remaining 14 applicants on 15 September 2017. The executive committee unanimously followed the recommendation of the DFB bid committee, which had ranked the 14 applicants. Berlin, Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich, and Stuttgart were all selected, having been ranked from 1–10. The Max-Morlock-Stadion in Nuremberg, HDI-Arena in Hanover, Borussia-Park in Mönchengladbach, and Weser-Stadion in Bremen were all dropped from the final bid, having been ranked from 11–14.[36][37] The zoning rule did not have to be applied, since according to the ranking no more than four and at least one venue per zone were ranked in the top ten.
