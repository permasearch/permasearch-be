At the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of Chely Wright's band, where he met Joe Don Rooney, the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a Printer's Alley nightclub[1] and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to join them. Jim Riley was the drummer and bandleader for the band.[4] The group covered the hit Shenandoah single The Church on Cumberland Road that night. To the group's recollection, a bond was formed instantly.
