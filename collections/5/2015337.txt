Early in the novel, Díaz aligns Oscar with comic book superheroes: "You want to know what being an X-man feels like? Just be a smart bookish boy of color in a contemporary U.S. ghetto...Like having bat wings or a pair of tentacles growing out of your chest."[35] Díaz hints at possible latent abilities or qualities Oscar may possess that will reveal themselves or develop later in the novel.
