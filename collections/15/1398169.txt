When Lorenzen arrived at Kentucky, he redshirted as a true freshman. As a redshirt freshman, he was named the team's starting quarterback by head coach Hal Mumme ahead of returning starter Dusty Bonner.[6] The move caused Bonner to transfer.[7] Lorenzen's career at Kentucky was marked by two head coaching changes; Mumme departed as an investigation into NCAA rules violations brought down his staff and resulted in the program being placed on probation with scholarship limitations. After Lorenzen helped lead the team to a 7â€“5 record in 2002, head coach Guy Morriss left to become the head coach at Baylor University and was replaced by Rich Brooks, who designed plays in which Lorenzen lined up as a receiver while Shane Boyd played quarterback. Despite all the turmoil, Lorenzen set school records in total offense, passing yards, and passing touchdowns, eclipsing many marks set by 1999 NFL No. 1 overall draft pick Tim Couch.[8]
