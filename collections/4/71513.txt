To blend in with the locals, he wears a hermit costume, an homage to his faux alter ego, Plays with Squirrels, that was seen in the Boy Meets World episode "Seven the Hard Way". A running gag is that he tends to mispronounce Maya's name. He eventually is elected senator and is faced with a decision involving his friend, Jack Hunter. He returned in the series finale.[3]
