Additionally, studies show that caffeine consumption results in "subsequent dysregulation" of HPA axis function,[9] which presents in anxiety-related behavior. When undergoing stress, the body activates a system-wide response mechanism known as the HPA axis. This stress signal begins at the level of the hypothalamus in the brain and undergoes subsequent amplifications throughout the body. This system succeeds in elevating blood levels of stress hormones, which results in the body shutting down secondary bodily processes, increasing hyperawareness, and readying the body for response to the perceived threat. Studies show that activation of this pathway is associated with "anxiety-related disorders such as panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder".[9]
