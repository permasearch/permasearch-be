Manning and Brady played each other seventeen times.[9] Brady led the head-to-head series 11–6, though Manning went 6–5 in their last 11 meetings. From 2001–2015, the two quarterbacks met at least once every season, with the following exceptions: the Colts and Patriots, longtime AFC East division rivals from 1970–2001, did not meet in 2002 following the NFL's divisional re-alignment; Brady suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 1 of the 2008 season; Manning missed the entire 2011 season due to recovery from multiple neck surgeries, as well as the 2015 regular-season meeting due to recovery from a torn plantar fascia. Brady led the Colts–Patriots series 8–4[10] and also led the Broncos–Patriots series 3–2,[11] though Manning's two wins with the Broncos both occurred in the AFC Championships in 2013 and 2015. Brady led the series in Foxborough 8–2 (7–2 at Gillette Stadium), while Manning led the series in Indianapolis/Denver 4–3.[11] The home team won each of the final seven games, with the last road win for either quarterback in the rivalry coming in Brady's 2007 win at Indianapolis.
