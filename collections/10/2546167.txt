The Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme, largely funded through government taxation.[174] It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.[175] There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006.[176][177][178]
