Suì-Fēng (砕蜂（ソイフォン）, Soifon, pinyin: Suì Fēng), born Fon Shaolin (蜂 梢綾（フォン シャオリン）, Fon Shaorin, pinyin: Fēng Shaolíng), is the captain of Squad 2 and also the current Commander in Chief of the Stealth Force. She is a hard worker who believes strongly in following orders. She is also outwardly antagonistic to her underlings as she believes this keeps them on their toes. During her childhood, she served as a bodyguard and eventual protégé of Yoruichi Shihōin with whom she developed a close relationship. When Yoruichi left the Soul Society, Suì-Fēng was crushed by the fact that Yoruichi did not take her with her. When Yoruichi returns to Soul Society a century later, Suì-Fēng engages her in battle yet did not manage to defeat her. After asking the question of why she was left behind, to which Yoruichi's answer is not heard, the two make amends.[13] Their relationship has become somewhat of a running gag: Suì-Fēng likes anything resembling a black cat (a form Yoruichi can assume at will) and displays jealousy should Yoruichi be in someone else's company. Suì-Fēng also applies battle techniques similar to Yoruichi, engaging the enemies by using hand-to-hand combat with Shunpo abilities.
