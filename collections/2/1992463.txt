After further course work at Columbia in early 1916 and summer teaching for Bement,[2] she was the chair of the art department beginning the fall of 1916 at the West Texas State Normal College, in Canyon.[17] She began a series of watercolor paintings based upon the scenery and expansive views during her walks,[13][18] including vibrant paintings she made of Palo Duro Canyon.[19] O'Keeffe, who enjoyed sunrises and sunsets, developed a fondness for intense and nocturnal colors. Building upon a practice she began in South Carolina, O'Keeffe painted to express her most private sensations and feelings. Rather than sketching out a design before painting, she freely created designs. O'Keeffe continued to experiment until she believed she truly captured her feelings in the watercolor, Light Coming on the Plains No. I (1917).[13] She "captured a monumental landscape in this simple configuration, fusing blue and green pigments in almost indistinct tonal graduations that simulate the pulsating effect of light on the horizon of the Texas Panhandle," according to author Sharyn Rohlfsen Udall.[13][18]
