Some authors have dealt with comparative studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot,[155] among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been done by several authors such as Martin Aronson,[156] and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored.[157] In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto[158] the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang,[159] have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.[160][161]
