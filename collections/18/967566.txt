In late 1988, a cover of the Chuck Berry chestnut "Rock and Roll Music"—recorded for the Yahoo Serious movie Young Einstein—went top 5 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Charts.[5] The single appeared on their next album, Cyclone Raymond, produced by Steve James, Mark Moffatt, Mark Opitz and Robyn Smith;[4] which peaked into the top 40 ARIA Albums Charts in October 1989.[5] A planned first single for 1989, "Love Comes Running" was cancelled from release in Australia, instead appearing in New Zealand only. The first single released in 1989 from the album, "The World Seems Difficult" was a top twenty hit,[5] but polished up for the overseas market, sounded unlike anything the band had previously released. Two further singles, "Baby You're Wild" and "Overwhelmed" did not peak into the top 50,[5] and promotion of the album was hindered after Smith injured his arm in a horse riding accident, and was hospitalised, which forced tour concerts to be postponed or cancelled. By early 1990, Mental As Anything members agreed to take a sabbatical to work on solo work and side projects.[1] Then Deputy Prime Minister, Paul Keating, opened their second group studio art exhibition in 1990.[1]
