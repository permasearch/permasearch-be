Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. (in office 2005–2009), a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the predominant religion in the state), was a proponent for less restrictive alcohol laws during his time in office. He believed reform would be favorable to the state's tourism industry.[17][18] He signed legislation allowing existing restaurants to remove the partitions, although future restaurants would be required to prepare alcoholic drinks outside of their patron’s immediate view.[19] Effective in June 2009, bars and clubs were no longer required to charge a cover, or a membership fee, making liquor more accessible to tourists and locals.[citation needed]
