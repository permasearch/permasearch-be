Robert K. Fullinwider (2003) describes one rather controversial method for multicultural teaching: teaching to “culturally distinct” learning styles. While studies have shown that “the longer these students of color remain in school, the more their achievement lags behind that of White mainstream students”,[16] it is still highly debated whether or not learning styles, are indeed culturally distinctive, and furthermore, whether implementing different teaching strategies with different racial or ethnic groups would help or further alienate minority groups.[17]
