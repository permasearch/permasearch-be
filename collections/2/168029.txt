In the November 19, 2014 issue, the story "A Rape on Campus" was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia.[71] Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity accused by Rolling Stone of facilitating the alleged rape, and The Washington Post revealed major errors, omissions and discrepancies in the story.[72][73] Reporter Sabrina Erdely's story was subject to intense media criticism.[72][74] The Washington Post and Boston Herald issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired.[75] Rolling Stone subsequently issued three apologies for the story. Some suggested that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape might result.[76]
