In the U.K., "Under Pressure" was Queen's second number-one hit and Bowie's third.  Queen's smash hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" reached number one in November 1975, just two weeks after Bowie's "Space Oddity" had done the same.  Bowie also topped the British charts in August 1980 with "Ashes To Ashes", his own answer song to "Space Oddity".[40]
