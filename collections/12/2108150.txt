Adult Swim primarily airs original shows from the U.S. block, as well as shows acquired from other sources. Several shows from its American counterpart are noticeably absent; G4's now-defunct ADd block and Much, following its shift towards comedy programming, are known to have broadcast a selection of them.[1][2][3][4] Until September 1, 2015, Teletoon's late night block, Teletoon at Night, also aired several of Adult Swim's original series; Adult Swim programming would return to Teletoon at Night in Fall 2017. There's currently no word yet on whether or not the block goes back to its original 9pm-5am slot.
