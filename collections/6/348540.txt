Osteopathic physicians are not evenly distributed in the United States. States with the highest concentration of osteopathic medical physicians are Oklahoma, Iowa, and Michigan where osteopathic medical physicians comprise 17-20% of the total physician workforce.[25] The state with the greatest number of osteopathic medical physicians is Pennsylvania, with 7,260 DOs in active practice in 2011.[26] The states with the lowest concentrations of DOs are Louisiana, Massachusetts and Vermont where only 1â€“3% of physicians have an osteopathic medical degree.[24][25] Public awareness of osteopathic medicine likewise varies widely in different regions. People living in the midwest states are the most likely to be familiar with osteopathic medicine.[27] In the Northeastern United States, osteopathic medical physicians provide more than one third of general and family medicine patient visits.[28]
