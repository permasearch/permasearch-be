The Devshirme came up out of the kul system of slavery that developed in the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire and which reached this final development during the reign of Sultan Bayazit I.[9] The origin of the kuls was mostly prisoners from war, hostages or slaves that were purchased by the state. An early Greek source mentioning devshirme (paidomazoma in Greek) is a 1395 speech of the Archbishop Isidore of Thessalonica. The speech meant to comfort the parents of young boys abducted after orders of sultan Bayezid I.[10]
