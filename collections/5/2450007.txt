Early inhabitants, around 3000 BCE were likely to have been connected through culture and trade to neighboring civilizations like Jiroft and Tappeh Sialk and the Indus Valley Civilization. Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BCE and it is possible that the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar) was a colony of the nearby Indus Valley Civilization.[3] The first known people were Indo-Iranians,[4] but their date of arrival has been estimated widely from as early as about 3000 BCE[22] to 1500 BCE.[23] (For further detail see Indo-Aryan migration.)
