A cheeseboard (or cheese course) may be served at the end of a meal, either replacing or following dessert.[28] A cheeseboard typically comprises portions of contrasting cheese with accompaniments such as crackers, grapes, nuts, celery and chutney. Port or other dessert wines may be served with a cheeseboard.
