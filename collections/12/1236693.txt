The recently discovered and very similar Chironex yamaguchii may be equally dangerous, as it has been implicated in several deaths in Japan.[3] It is unclear which of these species is the one usually involved in fatalities in the Malay Archipelago.[3][22] In 1990, a 4-year-old child died after being stung by Chiropsalmus quadrumanus at Galveston Island in the Gulf of Mexico, and either this species or Chiropsoides buitendijki are considered the likely perpetrators of two deaths in West Malaysia.[22] Warning signs and first aid stations have been erected in Thailand following the death of a 5-year-old French boy in August 2014.[23][24] A woman died in July 2015 after being stung off Ko Pha Ngan,[25] and another at Lamai Beach at Ko Samui on 6 October 2015.[26] At least two deaths in Australia have been attributed to the thumbnail-sized Irukandji jellyfish.[27][28] Those who fall victim to these may suffer severe physical and psychological symptoms, known as Irukandji syndrome.[29] Nevertheless, most victims do survive, and out of 62 people treated for Irukandji envenomation in Australia in 1996, almost half could be discharged home with few or no symptoms after 6 hours, and only two remained hospitalized approximately a day after they were stung.[29]
