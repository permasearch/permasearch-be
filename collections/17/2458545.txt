Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre.[25] He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image "really blossomed".[25] "He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."[26] Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year.[27] In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play, The Pistol Shot, in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale;[28][29] the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.[30] Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, Song of Norway;[31] this affected him, and several songs, such as "Letter to Hermione" and "Life on Mars?" reference her,[32][33] and for the video accompanying "Where Are We Now?", he wore a T-shirt with the words "m/s Song of Norway".[34] They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday, a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including "Space Oddity", which had not been released when the film was made.[35]
