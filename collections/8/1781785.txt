In 2004, Daniel returned to Genoa City as 16-year-old with raging hormones. He came home to visit his father for spring break. Phyllis heard that he was coming home, and she was desperate to get to know her son again. Danny and Christine told Phyllis to wait until they informed Daniel about his mother. Meanwhile, Daniel was befriended by Colleen Carlton (then portrayed by Lyndsy Fonseca), Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) and their friends. Phyllis ran into Daniel at the Crimson Lights coffeehouse; she realized who he was, and she began to talk to him. She told Daniel that she was his mother, and eventually, he asked her to tell him the truth about his family. Once Daniel discovered that Danny was not his biological father, he took off to confront him and Christine, who had resumed their romance. Daniel then decided that he should move in with his mother so they could get to know each other. Unable to find a suitable apartment, Phyllis and Daniel moved into Victoria Newman's (Heather Tom) house on the Newman Ranch. After being exposed as a neglectful parent who dumped his son in boarding school, Danny left Genoa City and went back on tour in 2004.
