Bing feels trapped living in an enclosed, automated space, as a member of a society that rides power-generating stationary bikes in exchange for "merits", a form of currency they can use to buy things they need. One day, he hears a girl named Abi singing in the bathroom and falls in love with her. He decides to gift her fifteen million merits, that she can use to buy a ticket for a talent show. Abi accepts and enters the contest, where she is given a psychotropic beverage to drink before she goes on stage. The judges are impressed with her singing, but they suggest she is better suited for pornography. Abi accepts their offer, unable to think clearly. Bing returns to the stationary bikes, determined to earn back the merits he needs to enter the contest himself, and finally manages to buy a new ticket. When he enters the stage, he takes the opportunity to express his indignation and threatens to commit suicide, while other members are watching in the audience. When he finishes talking, the judges offer him a weekly show, where he will have the opportunity to rant about the system. Bing accepts their offer.
