In general, the refractive index depends on wavelength (see dispersion) and the differential refractive index     Δ n   {\displaystyle \Delta n}   will also be wavelength dependent. The resulting variation in rotation with the wavelength of the light is called optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). ORD spectra and circular dichroism spectra are related through the Kramers–Kronig relations. Complete knowledge of one spectrum allows the calculation of the other.
