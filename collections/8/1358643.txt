At the foot of Indrakeeladri hills is the temple of Malleswara. The temple has inscriptions dating back to 9th century AD to 16th century AD by various kings. There are ten pillars and a mutilated slab (recognized as monuments by Archaeological Survey of India) with inscriptions in Telugu language. Of them, the inscriptions issued by Yudhamalla I and II of Eastern Chalukyas are important.[22]
