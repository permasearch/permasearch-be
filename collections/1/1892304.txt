The names for the nation of Greece and the Greek people differ from the names used in other languages, locations and cultures. The Greek name of the country is Hellas or Ellada (Greek: Ελλάς or Ελλάδα (in polytonic: Ἑλλάς, Ἑλλάδα)  Elláda[24][25][26][27]) and its official name is the Hellenic Republic (Greek: Ελληνική Δημοκρατία, Ellinikí Dimokratía [eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a]. In English, however, the country is usually called Greece, which comes from Latin Graecia (as used by the Romans) and literally means 'the land of the Greeks'.
