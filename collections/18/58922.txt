The halftime show started on the roof of NRG Stadium. Gaga started singing "God Bless America" as drones swarm behind her emitting red, blue and white color. She then sang Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land", followed by the ending of the Pledge of Allegiance: "One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all". Gaga then dove from the rooftop as the drones behind formed the design of the US flag. The singer came down and stood on a tall pillar across the stage, and started singing "Poker Face" as fireworks emitted behind her. After the first verse and chorus, Gaga, who was attached to a harness, bounced from the pillar to the main stage, and was joined by her dancers to sing "Born This Way", including the track's intermediate spoken verse.
