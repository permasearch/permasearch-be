Kicking the ball through an opponent's legs in order to get the ball past them and back to the original player is a dribbling skill that is commonly used among football players, with some of the most notable practitioners in the modern game including Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Eden Hazard, Vahid Amiri, Dele Alli, and Luis Su√°rez.[1] Suarez became so skilled at nutmegging opponents it led to the saying: "Suarez could nutmeg a mermaid."[2][3]
