Therefore, in this wire the electrons are flowing at the rate of 6995230000000000000♠23 μm/s. At 60 Hz alternating current, this means that within half a cycle the electrons drift less than 0.2 μm. In other words, electrons flowing across the contact point in a switch will never actually leave the switch.
