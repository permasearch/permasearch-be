The couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1838, later moving to Lynn, Massachusetts in 1841[30]. After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name:[25] previously Douglass had been given the second name of Bailey, but he now again felt[why?] the need to find a new name and asked Johnson[which?] to choose a suitable surname. Johnson had been reading The Lady of the Lake, and suggested "Douglass" after the principal character in the poem.[31]
