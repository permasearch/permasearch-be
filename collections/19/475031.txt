Anthropomorphism may be beneficial to the welfare of animals. A 2012 study by Butterfield et al. found that utilizing anthropomorphic language when describing dogs created a greater willingness to help them in situations of distress [42]. Previous studies have shown that individuals who attribute human characteristics to animals are less willing to eat them [43] and that the degree to which individuals perceive minds in other animals predicts the moral concern afforded to them [44]. It is possible that anthropomorphism leads humans to like non-humans more when they have apparent human qualities, since perceived similarity has been shown to increase prosocial behavior toward other humans [45].
