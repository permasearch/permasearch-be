The feminist theory underlying the Duluth Model is that men use violence within relationships to exercise power and control. This is illustrated by the "Power and Control Wheel," a graphic typically displayed as a poster in participating locations.[5][6] According to the Duluth Model, "women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and political status in society."[7] Treatment of abusive men is focused on re-education, as "we do not see menâ€™s violence against women as stemming from individual pathology, but rather from a socially reinforced sense of entitlement." [8] The program's philosophy is intended to help batterers work to change their attitudes and personal behavior so they would learn to be nonviolent in any relationship.
