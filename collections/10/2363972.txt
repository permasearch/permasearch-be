The overarching theme of the episode is "thugism." In beginning of Episode 6, the four remaining rappers appeared on the Miss Jones in the Morning radio show on New York hip-hop station "Hot 97". The rappers introduced themselves, and got a chance to freestyle. Listeners called in and said that the rappers would not make it in New York. During this event, a comment that John Brown made in reference to Clear Channel Communications gets him thrown out of the room; Miss Jones later explains that Hot 97 was, at the time, in a legal dispute with Clear Channel, who owns rival New York hip-hop station "Power 105.1". After the interview, mainly due to John Brown's comments, Persia reignites her rivalry with John Brown, blaming most of the embarrassment of the interview on him. Later on, $hamrock also questions John Brown's authenticity; he claims that Brown acts like a "robot," mainly due to Brown's "ghetto revival" statements and choosing not to open up to his roommates.
