A biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that has experienced great habitat loss.[65] The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by Norman Myers.[66][67][68][69] While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics.
