In 1936, de Havilland appeared in Mervyn LeRoy's historical period drama Anthony Adverse with Fredric March.[56] Based on the popular novel by Hervey Allen, the film follows the adventures of an orphan raised by a Scottish merchant, whose pursuit of fortune separates him from the innocent peasant girl he loves, marries, and eventually loses.[57] De Havilland played a peasant girl, Angela, who after being separated from her slave-trader husband, becomes opera star Mademoiselle Georges, the mistress of Napoleon.[58] The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture.[59] It garnered de Havilland good exposure and the opportunity to portray a character as she develops over time.[60] Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune found her later scenes as Mademoiselle Georges "not very credible",[61] but Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times called her "a winsome Angela".[62] That same year, she was reunited with Flynn in Michael Curtiz's period action film The Charge of the Light Brigade, set during the Crimean War[63][64] which became a box office success.[65]
