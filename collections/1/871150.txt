Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning completed 33 of 42 passes for 414 yards, throwing 4 touchdown passes and 1 interception in a winning effort. This performance prompted KCNC-TV to report, "After 5 games and 5 big wins, the Broncos are on pace to become the first team in the history of the NFL to exceed 600, maybe even 700 points, in a season. It is the most remarkable five-game stretch in the history of professional football. The numbers don't lie. What Manning has done in his first five games — his "assault" on the record books — is simply unprecedented."[28]
