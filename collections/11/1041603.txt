The temperature can vary, but is usually in the range of 50â€“59 degrees Fahrenheit[6][22] or between 12 and 15 degrees Celsius.[19][23] Some athletes wear booties to keep their toes warm[6] or rubberized coverings around their midsection while immersed. Some drink a warm beverage such as tea.[6] One report suggested that "ten minutes immersed in 15 degree Celsius water" was sufficient.[19]
