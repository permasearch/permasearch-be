Pioneered in the early 20th century by Arsenal[21] and later adopted by influential Argentine coach Osvaldo Zubeld√≠a,[22] the offside trap is a defensive tactic designed to force the attacking team into an offside position. Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender(s) move up field, isolating the attacker into an offside position. The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running up field against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed. Now that changes to the interpretations of "interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be "caught offside", making the tactic more risky. An attacker, upon realizing he is in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else first.
