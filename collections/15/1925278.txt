EasyJet has seen expansion since its establishment in 1995, having grown through a combination of acquisitions[12][13] and base openings fuelled by consumer demand for low-cost air travel. The airline, along with associate companies easyJet Europe and easyJet Switzerland, operate more than 200 aircraft,[14] mostly Airbus A319.[14] It has 28 bases across Europe, the largest being Gatwick.[15] In 2014 the airline carried more than 65Â million passengers,[16] making it the second-largest airline in Europe by number of passengers carried, behind Ryanair.[17]
