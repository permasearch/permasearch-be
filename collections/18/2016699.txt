In 2012, Klaveno was cast in the series regular role of Peri Westmore in the Lifetime comedy-drama series Devious Maids.[9] When ABC originally passed on the pilot for Devious Maids, Klaveno was cast as Lily Munster in Mockingbird Lane (NBC's 2012 remake of The Munsters). However, she was not granted release from her contract on Devious Maids as it was still in contention for series order on Lifetime. Klaveno was then replaced by Portia de Rossi.[10] Devious Maids was later ordered to series by Lifetime and premiered on June 23, 2013.[11] Klaveno was a regular cast member for the first season and made guest appearances in the second season. In 2014 she was cast as detective Janice Lawrence in the CBS crime drama series, Stalker, alongside Maggie Q and Dylan McDermott.[12][13]
