Although usually not fatal, Omphalotus spp., "Jack-o-lantern mushrooms," are another cause of sometimes significant toxicity.[10] They are sometimes mistaken for chanterelles. Both are bright-orange and fruit at the same time of year, although Omphalotus grows on wood and has true gills rather than the veins of a Cantharellus. They contain toxins known as illudins, which causes gastrointestinal symptoms.
