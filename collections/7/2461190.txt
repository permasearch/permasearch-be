PL-259, SO-239, and several other related military references refer to one specific mechanical design collectively known as the UHF Connector.[3] In some countries, for example in Israel, the term 'PL connector' is confusingly associated rather with the analog phone connector. The designations come from the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, its predecessor AN system, and the earlier SCR (Set, Complete, Radio) system.[12]
