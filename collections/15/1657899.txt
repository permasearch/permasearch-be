Vizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal,[7] caring, and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children and even strangers. Often they are referred to as "velcro" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Vizslas will cry or whine when they feel neglected or are otherwise unhappy. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the "pack" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained.
