Founded in 1959 as Florence G. Heller Graduate School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare, it became Brandeis first professional graduate school.[15] The school is named after Florence G. Heller the first female president of the National Jewish Welfare Board. Charles I. Schottland, a former Federal Commissioner on Social Security, was appointed as the first dean of the school.[16] In 1988, Heller faculty members conducted a research study titled, “Support Services in Senior Housing,” that led federal policy makers to enact the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990.[17] In 1998, the 14th Dalai Lama visited Heller and accepted an honorary degree from Brandeis.[18] In 2007, Bill Clinton gave an inaugural lecture at Heller's new building.[19]
