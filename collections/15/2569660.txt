The B-66s were used to locate and identify North Vietnamese radar sites that directed missiles and AAA fire, so that strike aircraft could avoid them. The RB-66C had no offensive capability, so it could not attack the radar sites directly. They were fully mission-capable, with up to twice the radar-jamming punch of a B-52 "buff". They were very helpful to F-105 strike missions. The "C" models were listeners Â : electronic intelligence (ELINT) and reconnaissance gatherers and also active jammers.The "B" models jamed in the blind as they had no direction finding ability. The "C"s protected the other b66s by keeping track of how close the gaggle got to the active SAMS and alerting the distance to the threat as the NVA would move the SAMS.
