The executive head of an Australian university is the vice-chancellor, who serves as the university equivalent of a chief executive officer.[8] The vice-chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the university and reports directly to the University Council, which the chancellor heads.[9] Assisting the vice-chancellor, the roles of deputy vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors have emerged to better manage the administrative overhead of the position.[10]
