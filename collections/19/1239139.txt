Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh,[2] Chris Bosh grew up in Hutchins, Texas.[3] A family-oriented person, Bosh often played basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[4] By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games.[5] Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games,[6] he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house.[4] Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman.[4] Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him.[6] Academically, Bosh always did well in school,[7] but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40â€“0 season.[8]
