Management of the Fraternity (PSK) on a day-to-day basis is vested in the executive vice president, Michael Carey. He and ten full-time staff members support all aspects of chapter operations, expansion, alumni relations, program development, risk management and event coordination. Phi Sigma Kappa's Grand Council operates as its volunteer Board of Directors, composed of one grand president and six directors who guide the Fraternity's future and ensure the implementation of its policies.
