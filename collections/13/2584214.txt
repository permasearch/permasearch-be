Celebrity endorsements do not guarantee long-term favorable effects, due to the risk to advertisers that the celebrity endorser may get caught up in a scandal, creating negative perceptions to consumers (Zhou & Whitla, 2013).[15] Common celebrity scandals involve alcohol, drug, sex, or crime related events (Muda et al., 2012).[14] These scandals can have a negative effect on the image of the brand, as consumers' negative perceptions of the celebrity endorser may be transferred to the brand, therefore negatively influencing sales of the brand's products (Zhou & Whitla, 2013).[15] One of the largest profile celebrity endorsement scandals of recent history was the infidelity scandal of Tiger Woods in 2009, at the time, Tiger Woods was a brand ambassador for Nike golf apparel and footwear. It has been estimated that Nike lost approximately US$5â€“12billion due to this scandal (Zhou & Whitla, 2013).[15]
