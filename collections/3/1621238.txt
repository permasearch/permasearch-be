"Baseball Darts" is also the name of a game played on a different type of specialized dartboard. Games are played with either two or four players. If it is between two players, they play head-to-head. If it is four, the teams of pairs play against each other.  The baseball dart board is designed just like a baseball diamond. There are several sections: Strike, Ball, Hit, Foul, Out, Sacrifice, Stolen Base, Single, Double and Triple. The center red dot is an automatic three outs and the surrounding area is an automatic hit.  Four balls means a walk and three strikes means an out. The count is reset any time the dart lands on another area such as Hit, Double or Home run. A player's turn is over if they make three outs.  If a dart misses the board, it is considered a foul. Just like real baseball, fouls are considered strikes, but they cannot strike out a player.  When playing with two players, each player gets to throw five darts or they get out, whichever comes first.[citation needed]
