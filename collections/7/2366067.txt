The road originally opened as Dart Boulevard on June 16, 1987 as a two-mile stretch between U.S. Highway 441 and Buenaventura Boulevard.[4] During the early 1990s, Disney World and Orlando area officials extended and upgraded the road to its current 12.4 miles (20.0Â km) parkway form, widened the lanes from two to four and added an interchange with Florida's Turnpike, with the highway opening on August 18, 1995.[5][6][7]
