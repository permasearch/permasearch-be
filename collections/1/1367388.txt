Conversely, most critics gave Andy's plot a negative review. Sepinwall called the entire plot "godawfulness".[15] Campbell referred to it as "a mediocre story that stood in stark contrast to the emotional timbre of the rest of the episode".[17] Cornet called the scenes "just as disconnected from the core of the show as that character has for some time now."[10] Porter wrote that "the show never quite got a handle on what to do with the character this season", and his subplot in "A.A.R.M." was the culmination of this issue.[19]
