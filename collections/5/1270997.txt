They were met by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans standing outside in front of the TRL studio window, all with signs supporting the duo.[52] Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from the sidewalk.[52] When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted.[52] All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show.[52] MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.[52]
