Mary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[26] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[27]
