The first mechanism is simple dietary lack of niacin. Second, it may result from deficiency of tryptophan,[3] an essential amino acid found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and peanuts[8] that the body converts into niacin. Third, it may be caused by excess leucine, as it inhibits quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT) and inhibits the formation of Niacin or Nicotinic acid to Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) causing pellegra like symptoms to occur.[9]
