Myoepithelial cells form a smooth muscle lining around the secretory cells; when the muscles contract, they squeeze the secretory ducts and push out the accumulated fluid into the hair follicle.[20][26] Sweat and sebum are mixed in the hair follicle and arrive mixed at the epidermal surface.[9] The apocrine sweat is cloudy, viscous, initially odorless, and at a pH of 6â€“7.5. It contains water, protein, carbohydrate waste material, and NaCl.[27] The sweat only attains its characteristic odor upon being degraded by bacteria, which releases volatile odor molecules.[23] More bacteria (especially corynebacteria) leads to stronger odor. The presence of axillary hair also makes the odor even more pungent, as secretions, debris, keratin, and bacteria accumulate on the hairs.[15]
