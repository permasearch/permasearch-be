Christianity is targeted by critics of colonialism because the tenets of the religion were used to justify the actions of the colonists.[50] For example, Michael Wood asserts that the indigenous peoples were not considered to be human beings and that the colonisers were shaped by "centuries of Ethnocentrism, and Christian monotheism, which espoused one truth, one time and version of reality."[51]
