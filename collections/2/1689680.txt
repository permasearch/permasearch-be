Flaky is a very sweet and helpful character, as evidenced by a couple of the TV episodes. All these factors suggest that Flaky is not only overcautious (as opposed to being a coward), but also one of the more kind characters of the series. However, as seen in the episode Snow Place to Go, she seems to be somewhat unstable - near the end of the episode, she begins to go insane and makes a companion with a garden gnome, singing "Rock-A-Bye Baby" to it after being trapped in the Arctic with no food or civilization. This is a very odd thing about Flaky but in some instances she is very strong and very brave, as in Ski Ya, Wouldn't Wanna Be Ya. Although in many instances she is very weak, even when she is powered by fear, this doesn't usually lead to her death but it can confuse many characters and they sometimes misconcept something else. This look is mostly looked in Without a Hitch, although then again this was her imagination.
