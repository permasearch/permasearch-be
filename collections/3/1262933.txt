Two organizations promulgate rules for horse shows where action devices are allowed: the Walking Horse Owners Association (WHOA)[49] and "S.H.O.W." ("Sound horses, Honest judging, Objective inspections, Winning fairly")[50] which regulates the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration.[32][51] The Celebration, in Shelbyville, Tennessee, has been held each August since 1939, and is considered the showcase competition for the breed.[13] However, in recent years the Celebration has attracted large amounts of attention and controversy due to the concerns about violations of the Horse Protection Act.[32]
