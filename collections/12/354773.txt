On January 1, 2007, the Turnpike Authority released its plan for exit 8 in East Windsor Township. The old interchange, located west of the Turnpike, was demolished and replaced with a brand new interchange, located to the east of the Turnpike. The new interchange configuration opened in January 2013, featuring a new toll plaza consisting of 10 lanes, with direct access to the Hightstown Bypass (Route 133) (without going through any traffic lights), as well as to Route 33 by using a grade-separated interchange.[65] Construction of a realigned Milford Road, near the interchange, was open to traffic in October 2011.[66] Milford Road was converted into an overpass crossing over the new interchange 8 ramp. The junction with the realigned Milford Road, Route 33 and Monmouth Street was also modified.[67]
