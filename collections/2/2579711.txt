Before 1832, most of Smith's revelations dealt with establishing the church, gathering his followers, and building the City of Zion. Later revelations dealt primarily with the priesthood, endowment, and exaltation.[240] The pace of formal revelations slowed during the autumn of 1833, and again after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple.[241] Smith moved away from formal written revelations spoken in God's voice, and instead taught more in sermons, conversations, and letters.[242] For instance, the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of God were introduced in sermons, and one of Smith's most famed statements about there being "no such thing as immaterial matter" was recorded from a casual conversation with a Methodist preacher.[243]
