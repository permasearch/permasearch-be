The Cricket World Cup is an international cricket competition established in 1975.[1] It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's global governing body.[2] The tournament generally takes place every four years. Most recently, the 2015 Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was won by Australia, who beat their co-hosts New Zealand. The current trophy was instituted in 1999. It always remains with the ICC, and a replica is awarded to the winning team.[3][4]
