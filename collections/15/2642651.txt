This Volkswagen Group engine is also used with slight modification, and with the addition of two turbochargers in the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Continental Flying Spur. It has also been used in a 600 horsepower (450 kW; 610 PS) form aboard the Volkswagen W12 prototype sports car to establish a 24-hour record of 323 kilometres per hour (200.7 mph) in 2002 at the Nardò Ring in Italy.
