During their second year of middle school, they meet Tamaki Suoh who invites them to join the newly formed Host Club. The twins agree to join only if Tamaki can guess which twin is which. Tamaki fails many times, but eventually guesses correctly, forcing the twins to join if only out of curiosity about this strange boy. The club opens them up to new experiences, including the development of a deep bond with Tamaki. Describing the world as "us" and "them," the twins general distrust of others and the world in general is further dissolved when Haruhi joins the club and with her unique ability to tell the twins apart immediately and always, she helps them become more independent of each other and more trusting of others.
