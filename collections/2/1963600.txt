In October 1975, after staging a counter-coup, the Brigade Staff acquired a new leadership of moderates with Tommy West serving as the Chief of Staff.[61] These men had overthrown the "hawkish" officers, who had called for a "big push", which meant an increase in violent attacks, earlier in the same month.[62] The UVF was behind the deaths of seven civilians in a series of attacks on 2 October.[63] The hawks had been ousted by those in the UVF who were unhappy with their political and military strategy. The new Brigade Staff's aim was to carry out attacks against known republicans rather than Catholic civilians.[62] This was endorsed by Gusty Spence, who issued a statement asking all UVF volunteers to support the new regime.[64] The UVF's activities in the last years of the decade were increasingly being curtailed by the number of UVF members who were sent to prison.[62] The number of killings in Northern Ireland had decreased from around 300 per year between 1973 and 1976 to just under 100 in the years 1977â€“1981.[65] In 1976, Tommy West was replaced with "Mr. F" who is alleged to be John "Bunter" Graham, who remains the incumbent Chief of Staff to date.[66][67] West died in 1980.
