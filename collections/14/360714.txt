In the early summer of 1912, aboard a train leaving Rock Island, Illinois,[16] Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen engage in a heated argument about consumer credit ("Rock Island").  The conversation eventually turns to another topic: a con man known as "Professor" Harold Hill, who scams parents by promising to form boys bands, taking payments for instruments and uniforms and skipping town with the money before being exposed.[17] Upon the trainâ€™s arrival in River City, Iowa, a stranger stands up and declares, "Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I shall have to give Iowa a try."  Retrieving his suitcase, clearly labeled "Professor Harold Hill," he exits the train.
