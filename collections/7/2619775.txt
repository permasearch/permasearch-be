The essential propylene glycol and/or glycerin mixture may consist of natural or artificial substances to provide it flavor.[21] The cytotoxicity of e-liquids varies,[20] and contamination with various chemicals have been detected in the liquid.[21] Some liquids were very toxic and others had little or no cytotoxicity.[20] The cytotoxicity is mostly due to the amount and number of flavors added.[20] Since nicotine has a bitter taste, nicotine e-liquids contain chemicals to cover up the nicotine taste.[19] The liquids contain aromatic substances like tobacco, fruit, vanilla, caramel and coffee.[21] Generally, these additives are imprecisely described, using terms such as "vegetable flavoring".[21] Although they are approved for human consumption there are no studies on the short-term or long-term effects of inhaling them.[21] The safety of inhaling flavors is mostly unknown,[110] and their safety has not been determined by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association.[41] In some cases e-liquids contain very large amounts of flavorings, which may cause irritation and inflammation on respiratory and cardiovascular systems.[69] Some flavors are regarded as toxic and a number of them resemble known carcinogens.[21] Some artificial flavors are known to be cytotoxic.[21] Unflavored vapor is less cytotoxic than flavored vapor.[23] A 2012 study demonstrated that in embryonic and adult cellular models, some substances of the vapor such as flavoring not found in tobacco smoke were cytotoxic.[111]
