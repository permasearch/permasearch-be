The first complete edition of the Babylonian Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg 1520â€“23[citation needed] with the support of Pope Leo X[19][20][21][22]. In addition to the Mishnah and Gemara, Bomberg's edition contained the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot. Almost all printings since Bomberg have followed the same pagination. Bomberg's edition was considered relatively free of censorship.[23]
