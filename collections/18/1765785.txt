A prayer flag is a colorful rectangular cloth, often found strung along mountain ridges and peaks high in the Himalayas. They are used to bless the surrounding countryside and for other purposes. Prayer flags are believed to have originated with Bon.[1] In Bon, shamanistic Bonpo used primary-colored plain flags in Tibet.[2] Traditional prayer flags include woodblock-printed text and images.
