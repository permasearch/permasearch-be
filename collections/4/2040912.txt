The Birthday Party has been described (some say "pigeonholed") by Irving Wardle and later critics as a "comedy of menace"[5] and by Martin Esslin as an example of the Theatre of the Absurd.[6] It includes such features as the fluidity and ambiguity of time, place, and identity and the disintegration of language.[6][7]
