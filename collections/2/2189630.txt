In his first year in professional ball, he broke the Appalachian League record for runs batted in with 147 and hit .338 for the season while belting 18 home runs.[1] He was portrayed in Hall of Famer, Eddie Mathews' autobiography as a "fun-loving teammate."[11] He did not play during the 1950â€“1953 seasons due to his service during the Korean War,[12] because he served in counter intelligence in the United States Army and received an honorable discharge upon completion of his service. Upon his return home, his baseball contract was purchased by the Brooklyn Dodgers. Pennell never reported to spring training for the Dodgers and instead decided to pursue acting, a career he dabbled in during the off seasons.[12] Regarding his retirement from baseball, sportswriter Furman Bisher was quoted as saying, "his future seemed unlimited...I shall always be frustrated by a desire to know how great a star he might have become."[13][14]
