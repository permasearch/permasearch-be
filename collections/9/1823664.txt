Among texts cited by Kersten, following Andreas Faber-Kaiser, is the third khanda of the Pratisarga Parvan in the Bhavishya Mahapurana which contains discussion of "Isa Masih" and Muhammed. However Indologists such as GrÃ¶nbold note that this section postdates not just the Quran,[52] but also the Mughals. Hiltebeitel (2009) establishes 1739 as the very earliest possible date for the section.[53]
