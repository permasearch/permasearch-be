Spencer tries to explain to Hanna and Emily the inconsistencies she discovered in Alison’s journal, which leads to a plan to lure Ezra out of obscurity using a bag of money for Ali. Hanna and Emily meet at Ambrose Pavilion to catch Ezra and wait for Spencer to arrive, who is supposed to be dressed as Alison. Someone dressed as Alison arrives and the girls assume its Spencer. Spencer comes later and the girls realize it was "A", not Spencer. They attempt to follow the girl but she runs off and the room’s lights start short-circuiting. As the girls are about to leave, Emily notices the bag and takes it, while Hanna notices a blonde wig in the trash.
