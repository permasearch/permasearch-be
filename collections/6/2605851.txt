Some bees add excess mud to the mixture, making it geopropolis, such as in the bee Melipona scutellaris.[1] Geopropolis displays antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity and has been proven to be a source of antibiofilm agents. It also presents selectivity against human cancer cell lines at low concentrations compared to normal cells.[2]
