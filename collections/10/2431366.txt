CONCLUSION By the original understanding, the Constitution’s Coinage Clause grants to Congress the express power to coin money and bestow legal tender quality upon that money. A similar power of lesser, but still broad, scope is also created by the Commerce Clause, since part of the eighteenth century definition of “regulating commerce” was the issuance and regulation of the media of exchange. By the original understanding also, the money thus “coined” need not be metallic. Paper or any other material that Congress selects will suffice. Because the power to coin paper is express, there is no need to justify it by the incidental powers doctrine of the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Supreme Court’s opinions in The Legal Tender Cases did rely on the Necessary and Proper Clause, and to that extent their reasoning was at odds with the original understanding. However, the holding of those cases – that Congress had authority to issue legal tender paper money – was correct as a matter of original understanding. There is, therefore, no need for originalists or others propounding interpretive theories to make any special accommodation for the holdings of The Legal Tender Cases.emphasis added
