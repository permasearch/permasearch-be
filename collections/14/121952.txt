It was reported that Bednar's mother, Lorin LaFave, "limited his access to electronics, installed parental controls and forbade him from using the same server as a boy she had grown suspicious of."[3] She recalled, "His personality was changing and his ideology was changing and he was starting to refuse to attend church with us. I felt like it was because of the negative influence of this person."[8] According to the Daily Mail, Bednar had been introduced to the 'exclusive' six-person online gaming club at a church youth group. Bednar's mother described Lewis Daynes as controlling the group, with the power to expel members, owning and controlling an Internet chat channel on which members would communicate by voice. She told the Daily Mail that Daynes had told her son improbable stories, such as donating $2.5 million in bitcoins to Syrian rebels and had told members they did not need to finish school because he would arrange Â£100,000 computer technology jobs for them.[7]
