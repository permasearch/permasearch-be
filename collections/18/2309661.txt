While many bacteria and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, they also have another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria,[78] mitochondria,[79] plastids[80] and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome).[81] It can synthesise a 3' extension where the vast majority of the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids[82] and likely also archaea.[77]
