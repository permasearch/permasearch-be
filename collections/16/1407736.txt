Like the North Magnetic Pole, the North Geomagnetic Pole attracts the north pole of a bar magnet and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic south pole. It is the centre of the region of the magnetosphere in which the Aurora Borealis can be seen. As of 2005 it was located at approximately 79°44′N 71°47′W﻿ / ﻿79.74°N 71.78°W﻿ / 79.74; -71.78﻿ (Geomagnetic North Pole 2005 est), off the northwest coast of Greenland,[17] but it is now drifting away from North America and toward Siberia.
