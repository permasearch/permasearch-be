Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge (or Lydia in a Loge) is an 1879 painting by American artist Mary Cassatt. The Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the painting in 1978 from the bequest of Charlotte Dorrance Wright.[1] The style in which it was painted and the depiction of shifting light and color was influenced by Impressionism.[1] This painting shows a view of the modern woman and is similar in style to Degas.[1]
