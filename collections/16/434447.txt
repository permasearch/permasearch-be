Sanjay Gandhi, son of late Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, implemented a forced sterilization programme between 1975 and 1977. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men. Some unmarried young men and political opponents may also have been sterilized[citation needed]. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to family planning, which hampered government programs for decades.[291]
