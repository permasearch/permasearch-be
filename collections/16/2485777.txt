Lewis Carroll (pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) (27 January 1832 â€“ 14 January 1898) was the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. He was named as a suspect based upon anagrams which author Richard Wallace devised for his book Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend. This claim is not taken seriously by scholars.[86]
