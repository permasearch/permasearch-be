Pecora was appointed counsel for what became known as the Pecora Investigation on January 22, 1933, and conducted his first hearing on February 15, 1933.[104] Earlier, on January 27, 1933, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a Glass bill separating commercial and investment banking.[49] Even earlier, at Glass's instigation, the 1932 Democratic Party platform had called for such separation.[92] During the 1932 Presidential campaign then President Hoover supported the regulation of investment banking, particularly securities affiliates of commercial banks, and Roosevelt supported the separation of commercial and investment banking.[105]
