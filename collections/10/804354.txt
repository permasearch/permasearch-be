By 2009, TerraCycle moved away from manufacturing to licensing all of its products.[23][29] As of the same year, it outsourced its vermicompost production to worm farmers in North Carolina.[30] From 2012, TerraCycle and various tobacco companies partnered to launch a widespread collection and recycling system for cigarette butts.[31] The cigarette butt filters, generally made from cellulose acetate, are refined into pellets that are then used in the production of plastic items such as shipping pallets, benches, and ashtrays.[32] The company promises that the recycled plastic from cigarette filters will only be used in industrial products and not in household plastics due to its exposure to nicotine.[32] The recycled cellulose acetate is mixed with other recycled plastics to create usable industrial products.[32] Tobacco and paper are composted in this program.[31][33] It took six months for the development of the cigarette butt recycling solution.[32]
