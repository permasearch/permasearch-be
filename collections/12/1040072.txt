The Hills focuses on the lives of Kristin Cavallari, Audrina Patridge, Lo Bosworth, Heidi Montag, and Stephanie Pratt. After receiving widespread criticism after having ten cosmetic surgery procedures in one day, Montag unveils the results to her family. After their underwhelming responses, she and her husband Spencer Pratt begin to alienate their family and friends. Meanwhile, Cavallari has become friends with Audrina after feuding with her during the prior season, and resumes a flirtatious relationship with her best friend and ex-boyfriend, Brody Jenner. Audrina finds herself conflicted with her relationship with her on-again/off-again boyfriend Justin Brescia, while Bosworth and the female Pratt are depicted as mutual friends of all.
