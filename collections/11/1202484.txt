Twin Peaks served as an inspiration for the 1993 video game The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, with director Takashi Tezuka citing the series as the main factor for the creation of the "suspicious" characters that populate the game, as well as the mystery elements of the story.[85] The show has also influenced a number of survival horror and psychological thriller video gamesâ€”most notably Alan Wake,[86] Deadly Premonition,[87] Silent Hill,[88] and Max Payne.[89]
