In the 11th century Shahnameh, the Persian poet Ferdowsi credits Burzoe with the invention of the tables game nard in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a Raja visiting from India. The Raja introduces the game of chess, and Burzoe demonstrates nard, played with dice made from ivory and teak.[52][53] Today, Nard is the name for the Persian version of backgammon, which has different initial positions and objectives.[54] H. J. R. Murray details many versions of backgammon; modern Nard is noted there as being the same as backgammon and maybe dating back to 300â€“500 AD in the Babylonian Talmud,[53] although others believe the Talmud references the Greek race game Kubeia.
