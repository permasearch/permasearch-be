Alan Landsburg and Rupert Hitzig produced the third film.[30] The second sequel capitalized upon the revived interest of 3-D film in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as Friday the 13th Part III and Amityville 3-D that also make dual use of the number three.[31]  As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, having been the production designer for the first two films, he thought that 3-D would "give him an edge".[31] Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard polarized glasses to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen.[32] Richard Matheson worked on the story and script, although many of his contributions were unused: the writer is unhappy with the finished film.[33] Carl Gottlieb, who had also revised the screenplays for the first two Jaws films, was credited for the script alongside Matheson.[34]
