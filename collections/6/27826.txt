SAARC does not have an official anthem like some other regional organisations (e.g. ASEAN).[61] A poem by poet-diplomat Abhay Kumar spurred a search for a better SAARC anthem.[62] Nepal's foreign minister has expressed the need for an SAARC anthem to connect SAARC nations.[63] Nepal at the 18th summit in Kathmandu in November 2014 planned to introduce proposal for an SAARC Anthem in the agenda of summit when heads of all member states meet here.[61]
