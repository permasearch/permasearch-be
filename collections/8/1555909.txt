Until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate (a Muslim Tatar state) maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East.[93] The slaves were captured in southern Russia, Poland-Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and Circassia by Tatar horsemen[267] and sold in the Crimean port of Kaffa.[268] About 2 million, mostly Christian, slaves were exported over the period 1500â€“1700[269] until the Crimean Khanate was destroyed by the Russian Empire in 1783.[270]
