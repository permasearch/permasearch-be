DAB radio stations work differently from AM or FM stations: a single DAB station transmits a wide 1,500 kHz bandwidth signal that carries from 9 to 12 channels from which the listener can choose.  Broadcasters can transmit a channel at a range of different bit rates, so different channels can have different audio quality.   In different countries DAB stations broadcast in either Band III (174–240 MHz) or L band (1.452–1.492 GHz).
