Malnutrition has been a persistent problem in Bangladesh, with the World Bank ranking the country first in the number of malnourished children worldwide.[256][257] Twenty-six percent of the population (two-thirds of children under the age of five) are undernourished,[258] and 46 percent of children are moderately or severely underweight.[259] Forty-three to 60 percent of children under five are smaller than normal; one in five preschool children are vitamin-A deficient, and one in two are anemic.[260][261] More than 45 percent of rural families and 76 percent of urban families were below the acceptable caloric-intake level.[262]
