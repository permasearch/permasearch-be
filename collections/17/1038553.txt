In December 2012, an article titled "Bicholim conflict" was deleted after standing since 2007.[201] It talked about a war that took place in India between the years 1640 and 1641, but was later confirmed to be completely fictitious.[202] The hoax article had won Wikipedia's "Good Article" award, a status conferred on fewer than 1 percent of articles on the site, a few months after its creation in 2007, and held that status for five years.[203]
