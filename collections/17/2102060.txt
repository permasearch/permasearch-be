Hussain has written a children's book of stories and recipes, Bake Me A Story, published by Hodder Children's Books,[8] which blends updated versions of fairytales (poor "Sleepless Beauty" just needs a nice cup of cardamom-infused hot chocolate to break her curse; resourceful Jack wins the giant over with yummy bean patties) with colourful illustrations and child-friendly recipes.[2] In 2017, Bake Me A Story was shortlisted for Childrenâ€™s Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[13] Following the success, a second cookbook and storybook compilation, Nadiya's Bake Me a Festive Story will be published in October 2017.[60]
