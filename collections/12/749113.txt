Males, or drones, are typically haploid, having only one set of chromosomes and primarily exist for the purpose of reproduction.[37] They are produced by the queen if she chooses not to fertilize an egg or by an unfertilized laying worker. Diploid drones may be produced if an egg is fertilized but is homozygous for the sex-determination allele. Drones take 24 days to develop and may be produced from summer through to autumn, numbering as many as 500 per hive.[37] They are expelled from the hive during the winter months when the hive's primary focus is warmth and food conservation.[37] Drones have large eyes used to locate queens during mating flights. They do not defend the hive or kill intruders, and do not have a stinger.[38]
