Although he is known to have been working in pastel as late as the end of 1907, and is believed to have continued making sculptures as late as 1910, he apparently ceased working in 1912, when the impending demolition of his longtime residence on the rue Victor MassÃ© forced him to move to quarters on Boulevard de Clichy.[24] He never married and spent the last years of his life, nearly blind, restlessly wandering the streets of Paris before dying in September 1917.[25]
