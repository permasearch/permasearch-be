Aphrodite was the patron goddess of prostitutes of all varieties,[61][44] ranging from pornai (cheap street prostitutes typically owned as slaves by wealthy pimps) to hetairai (expensive, well-educated hired companions, who were usually self-employed and sometimes provided sex to their customers).[62] The city of Corinth was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many hetairai,[63] who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled, but also the most expensive, prostitutes in the Greek world.[63] Corinth also had a major temple to Aphrodite located on the Acrocorinth[63] and was one of the main centers of her cult.[63] Records of numerous dedications to Aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions.[62] References to Aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in Corinth as well as on the islands of Cyprus, Cythera, and Sicily.[64] Aphrodite's Mesopotamian precursor Inanna-Ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution.[65][66][64]
