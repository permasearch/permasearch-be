The Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes.[23][24]:114 In 1794, the population reached its peak of 927, but by 1823 the total had dwindled to 381.[citation needed] There was extensive "comingling of the Costanoan with peoples of different linguistic and cultural background during the mission period."[22]
