Arrowhead Stadium is also recognized by Guinness World Records as having the loudest outdoor stadium in the world. This was achieved on September 29, 2014 in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots when the crowd achieved a roar of 142.2 decibels[134] which is comparable to standing 100 feet from a jet engine, which even with short term exposure, can cause permanent damage.[135]
