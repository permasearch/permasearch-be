A bike sharing service was approved by the city council on June 17, 2010.[108] The initial program consisted of 140 bikes at 14 locations supported by a "central hub".  It is expected to serve both residents and visitors. San Antonio Bike Share, a non-profit, was formed to oversee the operation, locally operated and maintained by Bike World. B-Cycle, the same system used in Denver, supplies the bike share system. It began operation in March 2011.[109]
