Peter arrives safely at the monorail with Walter and Olivia, without telling them how he escaped. Walter worries that he sees Cecil's death as an acceptable loss, an attitude that his former self used to have and worries that he is reverting to this colder personality, as a side-effect of having the previously removed portions of his brain restored (as occurred in "Letters of Transit"). Peter gently reassures him that he will not let that happen, as he holds Walter's hands between his. Olivia, seated further down the aisle, looks at them and smiles tenderly; Peter gives a slight smile then returns his attention to Walter. A few seconds later, he looks back up down the aisle and sees the world the way the Observers see it, machine-like and devoid of most colors. His eyes widen in surprise as the episode ends.
