Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae,[34] Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae.[17] Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World,[35] but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria.[36] Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review.[17] Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of Allosaurus.[12] Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.[7][17]
