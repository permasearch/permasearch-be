The brass reeds in common pitchpipes are subject to work hardening with use, so they gradually change pitch.  Because of this, replacement reed plates are sold.  Carried in a pocket, a pipe will occasionally pick up small bits of lint which works its way into the narrow space around a reed.  This usually requires disassembly of the pipe in order to clean the lint off the reed.  To avoid this eventuality many users will use a small holster to carry the pipe.
