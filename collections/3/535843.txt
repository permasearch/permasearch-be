One commonly suggested reason for inconsistencies in myth is that religious ideas differed over time and in different regions.[35] The local cults of various deities developed theologies centered on their own patron gods.[36] As the influence of different cults shifted, some mythological systems attained national dominance. In the Old Kingdom (c. 2686â€“2181 BC) the most important of these systems was the cults of Ra and Atum, centered at Heliopolis. They formed a mythical family, the Ennead, that was said to have created the world. It included the most important deities of the time but gave primacy to Atum and Ra.[37] The Egyptians also overlaid old religious ideas with new ones. For instance, the god Ptah, whose cult was centered at Memphis, was also said to be the creator of the world. Ptah's creation myth incorporates older myths by saying that it is the Ennead who carry out Ptah's creative commands.[38] Thus, the myth makes Ptah older and greater than the Ennead. Many scholars have seen this myth as a political attempt to assert the superiority of Memphis' god over those of Heliopolis.[39] By combining concepts in this way, the Egyptians produced an immensely complicated set of deities and myths.[40]
