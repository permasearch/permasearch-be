Erik Killmonger is portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in Black Panther (2018).[6][7] This version is an American black-ops soldier named Erik Stevens (born N'Jadaka[8]) who earned the nickname "Killmonger".[9] Rather than a Wakandan exile, Killmonger was rewritten as the son of Prince N'Jobu and an American woman from Oakland, California, making him T'Challa's cousin.
