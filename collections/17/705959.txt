Most types of normal hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A, hemoglobin A2, as well as hemoglobin F, are tetramers composed of four protein subunits and four heme prosthetic groups. Whereas adult hemoglobin is composed of two α (alpha) and two β (beta) subunits, fetal hemoglobin is composed of two α subunits and two γ (gamma) subunits, and is commonly denoted as α2γ2. Because of its presence in fetal hemoglobin, the γ subunit is commonly called the "fetal" hemoglobin subunit.
