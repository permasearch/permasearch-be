Exclusive to the 2002 series, Chief Carnivus (voiced by Paul Dobson) is the warrior chief of the Qadians, a tribe of cat-people. In "To Walk with Dragons," Chief Carnivus becomes a member of King Randor's council. He later gained an action figure in the Classics toyline where his full name is Carnivus Fervelius III.
