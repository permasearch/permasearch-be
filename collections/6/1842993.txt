Seattle Sounders FC were the defending MLS Cup champions, while FC Dallas were the defending Supporters' Shield champions. Both the Cup and Shield titles were won by Toronto FC, for the first time (and first by a Canadian team) on each. Toronto's win of the Canadian Championship in the same year earned them the first domestic treble by an MLS side.
