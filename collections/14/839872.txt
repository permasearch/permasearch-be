Private loans are generally only sought in addition to government student loans, rather than in place of them (for example if their student loan does not cover accommodation costs). These loans are not guaranteed by a government agency and are made to students by banks or finance companies. Unlike Government loans the repayments do not vary based on future earnings, and the loan will not be written off after a certain period.
