In December 1971, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the US President Richard Nixon sent a carrier battle group named Task Force 74, led by the nuclear-powered USSÂ Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India.[11][12] In response, the Soviet Union sent a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok to trail the US task force.[13] The event demonstrated the significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.[14] Following the 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test, the Director of Marine Engineering (DME) at Naval Headquarters initiated a technical feasibility study for an indigenous nuclear propulsion system (Project 932).[15]
