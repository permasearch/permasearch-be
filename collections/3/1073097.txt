The "CSI effect" is a reference to the alleged phenomenon of CSI raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of forensic science, especially crime-scene investigation and DNA testing.[53] This is said to have changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court.[54] Victims and their families are coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a "smoking gun" for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of CSI on jury members.[55] Some police and district attorneys have criticized the show for giving members of the public an inaccurate perception of how police solve crimes.
