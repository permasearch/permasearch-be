The Navy and Marine Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (SSDR)[5] is a service award of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps which was authorized in May 1980[6] and retroactively authorized to 15 August 1974, coinciding with a temporary suspension in authority for award of the National Defense Service Medal between that date and 2 August 1990. It was the first type of sea service ribbon established in the U.S. Armed Forces.
