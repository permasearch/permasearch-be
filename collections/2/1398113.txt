The station's DTT signal is at the maximum allowable power (1,000 kW ERP), while its original analog signal was not. Its digital signal on channel 20 is diplexed with Univision O&O WUVG (channel 34) into a master broadcast antenna at a separate tower, located at 1800 Briarcliff Road Northeast, in Atlanta's Morningside neighborhood. The station had also applied for an analog backup facility at this location, with a corresponding construction permit dating from its original application in 2003 to transmit from the WATL digital antenna on the same tower. Two subsequent applications in 2006 to increase the power of the backup have not been ruled on as of  October 2007[update]. Several other television stations have their transmitters on this tower, including WUVM-LP [channel 4] and W45DX-D [channel 45], and possibly WGCL-TV. (WWWQ [92.7 FM] is now located on this tower, sharing the same antenna with WZGC [92.9 FM]; WKHX-FM [101.5] is slightly lower on the tower, while WRFG [89.3 FM] transmits from much lower on the tower.) According to the FCC database, another tower holding several other stations is located about 110 meters or 350 feet east-northeast.[73][74]
