Boba Fett appears in the Star Wars: Droids episode "A Race to the Finish", in which the Fromms hire him to help them get back at Jord Dusat, Thall Joben, Kea Moll and the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. He later turns on them after failing their request, deciding to accept Jabba's bounty on the Fromms as compensation.[citation needed]
