One of the systems most often proposed is the Triple-E Senate (Triple-E stands for equal, elected, and effective), which would re-align the seats, make senators elected, and give them more powers.[43] Alberta is the only province that holds Senate nominee elections, although Saskatchewan plans to hold their own as well.[44] Prime Minister Stephen Harper was an advocate of an elected Senate, and had said that he would not appoint any new senators until there is reform.[44] In his first two years as prime minister, he appointed two. One of his appointments was Bert Brown, who was one of Alberta's elected nominees and is the second unofficially elected senator in Canadian history after Stan Waters in 1990.[45] Harper appointed a further 57 senators between 2009 and the end of his tenure as prime minister in November 2015.
