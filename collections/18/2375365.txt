Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir (鋼の錬金術師2〜赤きエリクシルの悪魔〜, Hagane no Renkinjutsushi 2: Akaki Erikushiru no Akuma, Alchemist of Steel 2: Devil of the Red Elixir in Japan) is the second role-playing video game for the PlayStation 2 based on the series of the same name. It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of season two (episode 27 "Teacher" and episode 28 "One is All, All is One") of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series, since the show took a four-month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the second opening theme song "Ready Steady Go" by L'Arc-en-Ciel and the shortened third ending "Motherland" by Crystal Kay.
