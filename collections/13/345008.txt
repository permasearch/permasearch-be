The first military effort coordinated between the HVO and the ARBiH, following the Washington Agreement, was the advance towards Kupres that was rekaten from the VRS on 3 November 1994.[230] On 29 November, the HV and the HVO initiated Operation Winter '94 in southwestern Bosnia. After a month of fighting, Croat forces had taken around 200 square kilometres (77 square miles) of VRS-held territory and directly threatened the main supply route between Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of RSK. The primary objective of relieving pressure on the BihaÄ‡ pocket was not achieved, although the ARBiH repelled VRS attacks on the enclave.[231]
