Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing.[5] Longinus ultimately promotes an "elevation of style"[5] and an essence of "simplicity".[8] To quote this famous author, "the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions."[8] The concept of the sublime is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself "above the ordinary". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: "great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement".[6]
