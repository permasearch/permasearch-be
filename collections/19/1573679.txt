Focus groups have a long history and were used[by whom?] during the Second World War (1939-1945) to examine the effectiveness of propaganda.[4] Associate director sociologist Robert K. Merton set up focus groups at the Bureau of Applied Social Research in the USA prior to 1976.[5] Psychologist and marketing expert Ernest Dichter coined the term "focus group" itself before his death in 1991.[6]
