The looking-glass self has three major components and is unique to humans (Shaffer 2005). According to Lisa McIntyreâ€™s The Practical Skeptic: Core Concepts in Sociology, the concept of the looking-glass self expresses the tendency for one to understand oneself through their own understanding of the perception which others may hold of them. This process is theorized to develop one's sense of identity. Therefore identity, or self, is the result of learning to see ourselves as others do (Yeung & Martin 2003).
