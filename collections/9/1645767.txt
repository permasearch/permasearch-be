The director planned to begin filming in March 2007.[20] However, principal photography began on 30 April 2007 in Sydney,[21] and Kidman found out that she was pregnant. She instantly withdrew from her next film, The Reader.[22] Afterwards, the production moved to Bowen on 14 May.[16] Filming in Kununurra was a gruelling experience for the cast and crew with temperatures soaring to 43 °C (109 °F) which, one day, caused Kidman to faint while on a horse.[22] In addition, she worked 14- and 15-hour days while dealing with morning sickness.[22] While shooting in a remote region of Western Australia, the shoot had to be rescheduled when the Faraway Downs set, the homestead central to the film's story, was reduced to mud from torrential rain – the first in 50 years.[23] The cast and crew went back to Sydney to shoot interior scenes until the expensive set dried out.[17] In addition, at one point, the entire country's horses were in lock down over equine flu.[5] Scenes using Darwin harbour were shot in July 2007, with parts of Stokes Hill Wharf blocked to the public and mini buses used to ferry tourists past the film set.[24] Filming lasted five months, wrapping up at Fox Studios, Sydney, on 19 December 2007.[25] In late April, Luhrmann titled his project Australia. Two other titles that he considered for the film had been Great Southern Land and Faraway Downs.[26] On 11 August 2008, eight months after filming wrapped, several members of the cast and crew were back at Fox Studios, Sydney, to film pick up shots.[27]
