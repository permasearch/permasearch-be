In sheer desperation, Jim asks band camp geek Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend, Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, spikes a laxative into Finch's mochaccino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. There Finch has diarrhea and emerges humiliated before a crowd of fellow students, being also left dateless.
