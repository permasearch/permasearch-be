By 1950, the Branham team included F. F. Bosworth. On the night of January 24, 1950, a photograph was taken of Branham during a debate between Bosworth and a Baptist minister regarding the biblical justification for healing.[25] The photograph showed a light appearing above Branham's head.[25][26][27] That "photograph became perhaps the most famous relic in the history of the revival"[28] Branham believed the light was supernatural and was a divine vindication of his ministry.[25] The photographer, Theodore J. Kipperman, stated in 1984 that it was "the most amazing thing I ever saw".[29] In 1951, U.S. Congressman William Upshaw, who had been crippled as the result of an accident, claimed he was miraculously healed in a Branham meeting and sent a letter describing his unsubstantiated experience to each member of Congress.[30][24] Upshaw died the following year. Branham claimed that King George VI of England was healed through his prayers,[31] although there is significant doubt in this regard given that the King died less than two years after Branham claimed to have prayed for him.[32] Branham also claimed to have witnessed a young boy raised from the dead in Finland in April 1950, although again there were widely divergent stories between Branham and other witnesses to the event.[33]
