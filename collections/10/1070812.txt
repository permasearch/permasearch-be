The worldwide Mars bar differs from that sold in the US.[10] The American version was discontinued in 2002[11] and was replaced with the slightly different Snickers Almond featuring nougat, almonds, and a milk chocolate coating.  Unlike the American Mars bar, however, Snickers Almond also contains caramel.[11] The US version of the Mars bar was relaunched in January 2010 and was initially being sold on an exclusive basis through Walmart stores. The European version of the Mars bar is also sold in some United States grocery stores. The US version was once again discontinued at the end of 2011.[citation needed] In September 2017, Ethel M Chocolates, a gourmet chocolate subsidiary of Mars, Inc. launched the 'original American recipe' of the Mars Bar in their stores and on Amazon.com.[12][13]
