During World War II, Toronto became a major centre for Canada's military. The Exhibition Grounds were taken over for military training and deployment. The Island Airport was taken over for training of the Norwegian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Civilian manufacturing companies, such as Inglis, were converted to war-time production of armaments. At Malton Airport and Downsview Airport, new aviation factories built many fighters and bombers to be used in Europe.
