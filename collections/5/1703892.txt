There is also a distinct possibility that Rwanda harbored ambitions to annex portions of eastern Zaire. Pasteur Bizimungu himself, President of Rwanda from 1994â€“2000, presented the then US ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, with the idea of a "Greater Rwanda." This idea purports that the ancient state of Rwanda included parts of eastern Zaire that should actually belong to Rwanda.[34] However, it appears that Rwanda never seriously attempted to annex these territories. The history of conflict in the Congo is often associated with illegal resource exploitation but, although Rwanda did benefit financially by plundering Zaire's wealth,[35] this is not usually considered an initial motivation for Rwandan intervention in the First Congo War.[36]
