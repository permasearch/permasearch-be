The first emergency number system to be deployed anywhere in the world was in London on 1 July 1937[1][3] using the number 999, and this was later extended to cover the entire country.[1] When 999 was dialled, a buzzer sounded and a red light flashed in the exchange to attract an operator's attention.[3]
