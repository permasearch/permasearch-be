Although obesity is a treatable disease, there are a very few number of programs and resources available to Canadians that can help treat it. As of 2017, according to Obesity Canada, out of 80,544 physicians, only 40 are certified through the American Board of Obesity Medicine, with proper training to provide aid with weight management and obesity. Only 9 out of the 10 provinces in Canada, perform bariatric surgery, and only 114 surgeons and 33 centers provide this service. Making only 1 out of 183 Canadian adults eligible for it. Anti-Obesity medication is not available for more than 80% of Canadaâ€™s population, because of the limited access to private drug benefit plans. In result of these limitations, support for cognitive behavioral therapy, and mental health support is also limited.[6]
