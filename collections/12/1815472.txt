Also included here are pre-NCAA records, college lacrosse records from prior to 1971. Compiling and validating lacrosse records prior to the "NCAA-era" is hit-or-miss. In many cases, USILA records can be gathered from a university's own record books. To date, the NCAA does not officially recognize lacrosse records prior to 1971 as well as several records during the NCAA era, and the USILA does not maintain a database of lacrosse records.
