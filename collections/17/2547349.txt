The commercial center of Port Arthur was at its peak in the early 1900s. Together with the effects of suburbanization, which drew off wealthier residents to new housing away from town, gradually taking businesses with them, from 1960 until 1974,[17] successive waves of economic recession caused much distress in the town. The central business district has many boarded up and vacant locations.
