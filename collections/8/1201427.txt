A single belt (serpentine belt) accessory drive was introduced on the L05, the 5.0L L03 and the 4.3L V6 LB4 engines used in the 1988 GMT400 models but not on the older R/V models (R/V models received the serpentine belt drive in 1989 when the front grille was facelifted in appearance to the GMT400 lineup).
