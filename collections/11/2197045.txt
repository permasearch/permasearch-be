Samadhi the last of the eight elements of the Noble Eightfold Path.[web 2] The Noble Eightfold Path is a condensation of more elaborate descriptions of this path, which starts with a householder who hears the dhamma and leaves home (either literally or figuratively), and after preparatory practices starts with the practice of dhyana.[12][note 2] Samādhi refers here to the jhanas, levels of gradual deepening of meditation. The Pāli canon describes eight progressive states of jhāna: four meditations of form (rūpa jhāna), and four formless meditations (arūpa jhāna). A ninth form is Nirodha-Samāpatti.
