After a series of disagreements, Mike D'Antoni removed Robinson from the Knicks' rotation for 14 games beginning on December 1, 2009. Robinson's agent, Aaron Goodwin, urged the Knicks to deal his client, or perhaps work out a buy-out with the team. After remaining on the bench for nearly a month, Robinson made his return on January 1, 2010, against the Atlanta Hawks, and scored 41 points off the bench in the Knicks' overtime victory.[16] He scored 21 of the Knicks' final 25 points, which included outscoring the Hawks by himself in overtime.
