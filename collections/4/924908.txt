Circular 230 is a publication of certain U.S. Treasury regulations which include the rules governing practice before the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These rules require attorneys, those qualified to practice as Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), Enrolled Agents (EAs), and other persons who prepare tax returns and provide tax advice to do certain things. The rules in Circular 230 also prohibit certain conduct. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. The rules in Circular 230 are codified as Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Subtitle A, Part 10 (31 CFR 10).[1][2]
