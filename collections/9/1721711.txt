After the episode, a fan-created website for the fictional European Fecal Standards and Measurements Institute appeared on the Internet.[17] It is presented as the official website of the institute, with distinct pages describing its work and organization structure. In accord with the episode, the site names Randy Marsh as the current record-holder, but it also claims that the record's previous holder was President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, who "is still considered one of the most prolific faecal producers."[17] Van Rompuy was not referenced in the South Park episode.
