BMRCL, in a public-private partnership, harvests rainwater from the viaducts on the rail system. The private partner, Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development (KRIDL), collects the water at multiple points, treats it, and sells it in bulk as potable water.[143] Pipes inside each metro viaduct pillar carry the rainwater from the viaduct down to underground tanks located beneath the median. When these tanks overflow, the water is diverted to 5 metre deep rainwater harvesting pits. Two rainwater harvesting pits are installed between each pillar. The average distance between two pillars is 28 meters. As of March 2017, a 33.48 km of elevated metro are covered by the rainwater harvesting system. With the completion of Phase 2 of the metro, the BMRCL will cover a total of 58 km with rainwater harvesting systems.[144] Around 8 crore litres of water are expected to be collected annually.[145]
