Yochai Benkler, in his book The Wealth of Networks from 2006, suggests that virtual communities would 'come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction'.[18] Although Benkler's prediction was not entirely correct, it is clear that communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a 'thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours' and the beginnings of the 'emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships'.[18] Despite being acknowledged as 'loose' relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.
