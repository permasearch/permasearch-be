"Ordinary World" is one of two Cuccurullo-era songs ("Come Undone" being the other) which were played when Duran Duran did their reunion tour, both Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor insisting on playing it. Cuccurullo was brought in to teach Andy Taylor how to play it. It has remained in the set list ever since.
