The role of a radio producer may also include that of a board operator or technical operator who may operate the technical controls (sound volume levels, recording software, switchboard, etc.) for another person, the on-air talent. The producer often used to be in a separate control room, usually separated from the radio studio by a window, which allowed visual contact while blocking noise. Nowadays this has changed in some ways.
