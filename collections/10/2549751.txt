Impressed by her success, Snively arranged a contract for Monroe with an acting agency in June 1946.[54] After an unsuccessful interview with producers at Paramount Pictures, she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon, a 20th Century-Fox executive. Head executive Darryl F. Zanuck was unenthusiastic about it,[55] but he was persuaded to give her a standard six-month contract to avoid her being signed by rival studio RKO Pictures.[c] Monroe's contract began in August 1946, and she and Lyon selected the stage name "Marilyn Monroe".[57] The first name was picked by Lyon, who was reminded of Broadway star Marilyn Miller; the last was picked by Monroe after her mother's maiden name.[58] In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who was against her having a career.[59]
