The day of the dance has arrived. Amber, Nina, and Fabian had the same dream involving Senkhara pushing Nina into the chasm the night before. Vera and Trudy have a bake-off during the dance. Mrs. Andrews finds a receipt near Vera's cake and suspects she may have bought it. Meanwhile, down in the tunnels, Amber, Nina, and Fabian attempt the deadly hopscotch challenge. The three complete the hopscotch challenge, but there is a bigger test to come. Eddie gets Patricia into trouble over the music and then saves the day before she can be expelled by Victor. Nina and Fabian are alarmed to see that their dream from the night before is coming true.
