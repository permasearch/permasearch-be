Claire Redfield and Moira Burton, daughter of Barry Burton, work for a biohazard prevention agency Terra Save, and are kidnapped by masked assailants. Claire and Moira are taken to a facility on Sushestvovanie Island, where the "Afflicted" are in wait. An unknown woman calling herself the "Overseer" watches via cameras and tells them the bracelets on their wrists record fear, as the pair try to find safety. Upon reaching a radio tower, they call for help. Once Barry reaches the island, he immediately meets Natalia, a strange little girl. Together, they head to the radio tower, encountering many dangerous situations along the way. Unfortunately, Barry arrives very late as the distress call was actually made 6 months ago. After having a severe headache, Natalia claims Moira is dead.
