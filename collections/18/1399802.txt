While most bastards content themselves with life, Ramsay had larger ambitions.  He considers himself a true Bolton despite his birth and is highly resentful of his baseborn status and will violently correct those who refer to him otherwise.  Roose suspects that it was Ramsay who murdered Roose's trueborn heir Domeric, and expects that Ramsay will kill all of Roose's future children.  The suspected poisoning of Domeric also earned Ramsay the enmity of House Dustin, as Lady Barbrey Dustin was fond of her nephew Domeric.  Two years prior to the beginning of the series, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort as he had no other sons, and Ramsay learned to read and write.  He is a cunning and capable manipulator who is particularly good at thinking on his feet, though less savvy when it comes to long-term consequences and intricate politics.  Roose chides Ramsay for his abusive "amusements" as it goes against Roose's creed of creating "a peaceful land, a quiet people" image for House Bolton's rule, but Ramsay refuses to listen.
