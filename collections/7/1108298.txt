Other producers' tracks are more up-tempo and shift from the melancholic mood of Shebib's production.[36] Songs on the album are lengthy, sonically expansive,[35] and accompanied by playful interludes.[45] Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald writes of the song structure on Take Care, "Musical themes vanish and re-appear, layers build upon layers and then strip down to bare bones as tightly wound tracks give way to gauzy, lush interludes. Most songs sound intentionally distorted and warped".[35] Drake's vocals on the album feature emotional crooning, alto vocals,[41] a guttural cadence,[44] a melodic flow,[46] and a larger emphasis on singing than on his previous album, Thank Me Later.[36][47][48][49]
