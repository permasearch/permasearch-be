The viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission.[60] During the first 2.5Â months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load.[58] If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.[53]
