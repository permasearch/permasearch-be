In 2009, animal rights group PETA released undercover video of alleged abuses of former race horses at a slaughterhouse in Kumamoto, Japan. The group stated that "as many as 20,000" horses, including former Thoroughbred race horses, were killed in 2008 in Japan for use as human and pet food.[75](The official figure for 2008 was 15,003 horses.[76]) Based on findings of 2009 and fate of 1986 Kentucky Derby Winner Ferdinand, PETA has called ban for exporting race horses to Japan,[75] even though the amount of young horses exported to Japan for racing purposes is insignificant compared to the overall amount[77] and only adult horses exported to Japan are breeding stock.[78]
