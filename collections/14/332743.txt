The most discussed pollution of the Hudson River is General Electric's contamination of the river with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977.[87] This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who ate fish from the river or drank the water.[88][89] In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem. The activism led to the site being designated as one of the superfund sites.[90] Other kinds of pollution, including mercury contamination and sewage dumping, have caused problems as well.[91][92]
