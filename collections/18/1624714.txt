There is no good evidence to suggest which method of counting fetal movement is best.[25] It was suggested that formal movement counting such as count to 10 or counting movements at a specific time each day was more effective than an undefined method in detecting when the baby was in distress.[25] More research is needed to establish whether counting movements does reduce the rates of stillbirths particularly in countries where resources are not readily available.[25]
