Chevrolet introduced a medium duty version of its Silverado, the Silverado 4500HD and 5500HD, which will replace the discontinued Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick medium duty trucks. The truck was unveiled at the 2018 Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana in March 2018, and will join the Chevrolet 4500HD/XD and 5500HD/XD cabover trucks. It will compete with the Ford Super Duty F-450 and F-550 and Ram 4500 and 5500.[36] Chevrolet also plans to make the vehicles available for sale at least 160 selected dealerships, including the 240 that specializes in fleet and commercial truck sales.[37]
