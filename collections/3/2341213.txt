"The Master Plan" marked the first appearance of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale "Freddy Spaghetti" and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast,[10][11] a decision he made in part because it was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: "It was a matter of me asking Starz if it was going to continue, and them saying they weren't ready to make that decision. I couldn't pass up the opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore."[12] Schur said when the Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the "dream scenario" for casting.[13] Schur described Scott as "brilliant and funny" and praised his comedic range: "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans 'Step Brothers' to 'Party Down.'".[10] Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined.[14][15] Scott, however, said he feels they are "vastly different characters and circumstances".[12] The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced.[6][16] During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. Those pictures are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.[17]
