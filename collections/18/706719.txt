The story is based on the first half of a Hindi novel, Kohbar Ki Shart, by Keshav Prasad Mishra. A Brahman farmer from Eastern Uttar Pradesh lives with his two nephews. He falls ill and is treated by a Vaidya (indigenous medical practitioner) from another village. When the farmer feels okay, he asks the Vaidya about his fees. The Vaidya asks for the farmer's eldest nephew to marry his eldest daughter. The farmer readily agrees.
