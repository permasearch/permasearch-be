Eckstein reprised the role of Ahsoka for Rebels, although she did not do all of Fulcrum's voice work.[14] She learned about Ahsoka's return about a year before the first season's finale aired and said it was hard to keep it a secret.[19] Eckstein said Ahsoka developed a quiet confidence and quiet strength the younger character doesn't possess, but sometimes she played Ahsoka too seriously; she pointed out that "snippiness" and determination are still part of Ahsoka's personality.[12] Eckstein pitched her voice down a bit but, because she and Ahsoka were close in age, generally spoke like herself.[19]
