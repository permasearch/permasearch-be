Ox Ford (オックス・フォード, Okkusu Fōdo) is a meister and honors student who attends DWMA's EAT class. He is a bookworm who takes his studies very seriously, but considers himself to be a great warrior in battle, calling himself the "Great General Lightning King". His weapon partner is Harvar D. Éclair (ハーバー・ド・エクレール, Hābā Do Ekurēru), who takes the form of a spear with a head shaped like a lightning bolt, allowing him to conjure electricity. Ox has a shaved head with two spikes of hair on the sides of his head, which he takes great pride in. He has a mostly one-sided love for Kim Diehl, and is instrumental in persuading her to return to DWMA after she defects and is brainwashed into serving Arachnophobia, going as far as ripping out his hair to prove his loyalty to her, and growing out a full head of hair at her request.
