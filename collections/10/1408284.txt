House Blackfyre is a semi-extinct cadet house of House Targaryen. Their sigil is a three headed black dragon on a red field, the reverse of House Targaryen. House Blackfyre was founded when Aegon IV "the Unworthy" (reigned AL 172-184) legitimized all his bastard children on his death bed. Aegon gave "Blackfyre," the sword of the first Targaryen king to his bastard Daemon, seeming to signify his favour for Daemon over the heir apparent: his true born son Daeron. When Aegon IV died, Daemon I Blackfyre contested Daeron II Targaryen's right to the Iron Throne. This challenge set off conflicts between AL 184-260 where a series of Blackfyre pretenders vied for the Iron Throne[18]
