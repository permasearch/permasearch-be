Within the doctrine of Jainism, the tirthankara holds the highest status. Hemachandra says that a deva (roughly god) is the one who has conquered his internal desires and passions. This requirement, according to him, was fulfilled only by the tirthankara. The gods of Hindus were considered as the one in whom the desires and the internal passion are not present as they are the one who created them,but they act like as if they have been affected by the three Guna's(satvika human,rajjo human and thamo gunam) inorder to teach us dharma in the form of epics.
