Following the revelation in 2013's "The Day of the Doctor" and "The Time of the Doctor" that the Time Lords were not, as originally believed, wiped out by the Doctor's hand,[16][17][18] Susan's fate after The Five Doctors remains ambiguous. In "Death in Heaven" (2014), the Twelfth Doctor's (Peter Capaldi) companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) pretends to be the Doctor in order to confuse the Cybermen and buy herself time to escape; she describes the Doctor's children and grandchildren as "missing and, I assume, dead."[19] In the Class episode "For Tonight We Might Die", Susan's name is displayed on the roll of honour at Coal Hill Academy, along with Clara Oswald and Danny Pink. A photograph of Susan is seen on the Doctor's desk in a university where he is lecturing in 2017's "The Pilot", beside a photograph of River Song.
