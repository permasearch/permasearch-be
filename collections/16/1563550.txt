Omar Nobles praised Deidrick's portrayal and stated: "Deidrickâ€™s enduring charm and emotional performances helped turn the tide in favor of the one-time bad boy" which would lead to his popularity.[20] Upon the announcement of Deidrick's departure, Michael Fairman described the actor as "one of the best young actors on daytime."[22] Jamey Giddens said "As much as I'm going to miss the tall, drink of DiMera, I can't say I blame Deidrick." Giddens attributed the decision to Chad's dramatic decline in screen time following Burnett's departure.[64] Though sad about Deidrick's departure, Nobles said the actor had a great "future ahead of him."[20] Fairman praised Deidrick for his portrayal of Chad's final scenes which aired on October 30, 2013.[65]
