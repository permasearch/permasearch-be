The tournament shares its name with the trophy, also called the Copa Libertadores or simply la Copa, which is awarded to the Copa Libertadores winner. It was designed by goldsmith Alberto de Gasperi, an Italian-born emigrant to Peru, in Camusso Jewelry in Lima at the behest of CONMEBOL.[69] The top of the laurel is made of sterling silver, with the exception of the football player at the top (which is made of bronze with a silver coating).[70]
