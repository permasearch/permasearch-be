For the main villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery suggested Klaus Maria Brandauer, the lead of the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film Mephisto.[23] Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld,[24] although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film.[25] For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush â€“ the name coming from one of the early scripts of Thunderball.[13] Carrera's performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress,[26] which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood.[27] Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a hotel in London and suggested her to Connery, which he agreed upon.[13] For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable.[23] Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who later parodied Bond in his role of Johnny English.[28]
