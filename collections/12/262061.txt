In contrast to the past, when emphasis was placed on the applicants' ideological criteria, the current CPC stresses technical and educational qualifications.[82] To become a probationary member, the applicant must take an admission oath before the party flag.[82] The relevant CPC organization is responsible for observing and educating probationary members.[82] Probationary members have duties similar to those of full members, with the exception that they may not vote in party elections nor stand for election.[82] Many join the CPC through the Communist Youth League.[82] Under Jiang Zemin, private entrepreneurs were allowed to become party members.[82] According to the CPC constitution, a member, in short, must follow orders, be disciplined, uphold unity, serve the Party and the people, and promote the socialist way of life.[81] Members enjoy the privilege of attending Party meetings, reading relevant Party documents, receiving Party education, participating in Party discussions through the Party's newspapers and journals, making suggestions and proposal, making "well-grounded criticism of any Party organization or member at Party meetings" (even of the central party leadership), voting and standing for election, and of opposing and criticizing Party resolutions ("provided that they resolutely carry out the resolution or policy while it is in force"); and they have the ability "to put forward any request, appeal, or complaint to higher Party organizations, even up to the Central Committee, and ask the organizations concerned for a responsible reply."[81] No party organization, including the CPC central leadership, can deprive a member of these rights.[81]
