Munro's career continued to thrive well in the 1980s, appearing in many slasher and Eurotrash productions. Her first film shot on American soil was the William Lustig production Maniac.[12] This was soon followed by the "multi-award winning, shot during the Cannes Film Festival" shocker The Last Horror Film[6] (directed by David Winters), in which she was reunited with her Maniac co-star Joe Spinell. She had a cameo role in the film Don't Open Till Christmas,[6] Slaughter High,[6] Paul Naschy's Howl of the Devil, and Jess Franco's Faceless, followed in rapid succession. She reteamed with Starcrash director, Luigi Cozzi, for Demons 6: De Profundis (aka Il gatto nero) in 1989, though this would be her last major film appearance.
