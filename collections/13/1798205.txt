The primary parts that make up an e-cigarette are a mouthpiece, a cartridge (tank), a heating element/atomizer, a microprocessor, a battery, and possibly a LED light on the end.[2] The only exception to this are mechanical e-cigarettes (mods) which contain no electronics and the circuit is closed by using a mechanical action switch.[23] E-cigarettes are sold in disposable or reusable variants.[8] Disposable e-cigarettes are discarded once the liquid in the cartridge is used up, while rechargeable e-cigarettes may be used indefinitely.[24] A disposable e-cigarette lasts to around 400 puffs.[25] Reusable e-cigarettes are refilled by hand or exchanged for pre-filled cartridges, and general cleaning is required.[4] A wide range of disposable and reusable e-cigarettes exist.[26] Disposable e-cigarettes are offered for a few dollars, and higher-priced reusable e-cigarettes involve an up-front investment for a starter kit.[19] Some e-cigarettes have a LED at the tip to resemble the glow of burning tobacco.[21] The LED may also indicate the battery status.[1] The LED is not generally used in personal vaporizers or mods.[2]
