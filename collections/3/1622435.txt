In May 1895, the Royal Navy occupied the Nicaraguan port of Corinto, after a number of British subjects, including the Vice-consul, had been seized during disturbances, shortly after the former protectorate of the Mosquito Coast had been incorporated into Nicaragua.[8] The British demanded an indemnity of Â£15,000.[8] US Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham thought the demands harsh, but also that they should be met.[8] US public opinion, however, was outraged at this British military activity in the United States' sphere of influence.[8]
