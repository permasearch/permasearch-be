The 2016/17 season was one of Arsenal’s most testing for European spots,having taken a race with Liverpool and Manchester City to the final day of the season.Sadly though,despite winning 3-1 against Everton,results elsewhere meant they only finished fifth,missing out on a UCL spot for the first time in two decades.They didn’t finish the season empty-handed though,as they won the FA Cup Final 2-1 against Chelsea,to get their third in four years.
