Fry struggled to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995.[150] When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: "I suppose it all began when I came out of the womb. I looked back up at my mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'."[151] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010.[152] In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.[153]
