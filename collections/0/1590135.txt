The Pluto–Charon system is one of the few in the Solar System whose barycenter lies outside the primary body; the Patroclus–Menoetius system is a smaller example, and the Sun–Jupiter system is the only larger one.[131] The similarity in size of Charon and Pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a double dwarf planet.[132] The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to the other, which means that Pluto and Charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other. From any position on either body, the other is always at the same position in the sky, or always obscured.[133] This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter.[84]
