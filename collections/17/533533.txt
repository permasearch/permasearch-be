For the first time at a World Cup Finals, referees could issue yellow and red cards (a system that is now commonplace at every level of football worldwide),[85] yet, in contrast to the previous tournaments (besides the 1950 edition) and all subsequent tournaments to date, no player was expelled from play.[86] The officiating of the opening match, commentated by some media as overly strict,[87][88][89] set a standard of discipline that instead helped protect skillful players in accordance with FIFA's stated wish.[54][90][91] The tournament's average of 2.97 goals per game set a level not since bettered.
