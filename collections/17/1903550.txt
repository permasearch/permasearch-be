In 2007, a villager from China's Shaanxi Province claimed to have risked his life by taking more than 30 digital photographs of a tiger. The Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau backed up this claim in a press conference.[33][34] The photographs aroused suspicion, with many expressing doubts about their authenticity.[35] In November 2007, the Shaanxi Province Forestry Bureau still "firmly believed" that wild South China tigers exist in the province.[36] Yet in February 2008, the Shaanxi Province Forestry Bureau released an apology, qualifying their earlier statements but without repudiating the pictures' authenticity, writing "We curtly released the discovery of the South China tiger without substantial proof, which reflects our blundering manner and lax discipline."[37] In June 2008, the authorities announced that all pictures published were proven to be forged, related officers have been punished and the alleged photographer been arrested for suspicion of fraud. This officially ended the scandal.[38]
