The winners of the FIFA Ballon d'Or are chosen by international journalists and the coaches and captains of the national teams under FIFA's jurisdiction.[3] In a system based on positional voting, each voter was allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists were ordered based on total number of points. Voters were provided with a shortlist of 23 players from which they could select the three players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.[8]
