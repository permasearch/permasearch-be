As of 2012 none of the power generators appear to be committed to the construction of any new fossil-fuelled power stations. However, for several years there have been two unactioned but reasonably well defined proposals for gas-fired power stations with 880Â MW of generating capacity in the Auckland area. Both the proposed Rodney Power Station (Genesis Energy) near Helensville and the proposed Otahuhu Power Station C plant (Contact Energy) have resource consents.
