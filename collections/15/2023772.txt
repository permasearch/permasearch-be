The fastback version of the Regal, now branded as Regal Sportback, is the replacement for the Regal sedan. Its design has a sedan-like feature based on its appearance. It has grown larger in size, and is around 300 to 500 pounds lighter than the previous Regal.[36] It carries two versions of the LTG 2.0 L Turbocharged inline-4 engine. Front-wheel drive models produce 250 hp (186 kW) @ 5400 rpm and 260 lb⋅ft (353 N⋅m) @ 2000 rpm, while the all-wheel drive model produces 250 hp (186 kW) @ 5500 and 295 lb⋅ft (400 N⋅m) @ 3000 rpm, respectively.[37]
