Ethel Darling (portrayed by Kathy Bates as adult Ethel, Kathy Deitch as young Ethel) is a bearded lady, the mother of Jimmy, and the ex-wife of Dell. In the 1920s and 30s, she was a popular vaudeville star before marrying Dell, who convinced her to seek more upscale venues. These higher-paying audiences rejected her, ruining her reputation and career. She left Dell after he attempted to kill Jimmy as an infant. She then battled alcohol addiction and was rescued from a drunk tank by Elsa. She then served as Elsa's second in command at the freak show. In "Edward Mordrake (Part 1)", she is diagnosed with Cirrhosis of the liver and is given a prognosis of six months to a year. In "Blood Bath", she is killed by Elsa, sustaining a fatal stab wound to the eye following a major confrontation about Elsa's loyalty to the freaks. The rest of the freaks believe that she was decapitated in a car accident that was, in reality, staged by Elsa and Stanley. She later appears as a hallucination to both Jimmy and Dell. In "Curtain Call", she appears with the other dead freaks in Elsa's afterlife and appears to forgive Elsa for her sins. For her performance, Bates was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress â€“ Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.
