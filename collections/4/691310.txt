The video begins with a static television screen showing the group's name before interchanging clips from the Hotel Transylvania 2 movie and individual takes of the girls inside a hotel. The setting is Halloween themed with skulls, candles and dim lighting through out the area. All girls then stand in front of a hotel, with different colored suitcases and each wearing coats while dancing. Lauren then sings as she holds a rotary dial telephone in her hand. The scene intensifies as rapid shots of the girls appear on screen. Synchronized choreography is performed by all the girls, in front of the hotel. Interchanged scenes consist of movie clips and Normani and Dinah behaving in a seductive way as the monsters make their way towards the halls.
