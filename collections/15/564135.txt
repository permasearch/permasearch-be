Elsewhere, the song mentions the wise men who bow before the Lord's throne, and cast their "golden crowns" at the feet of God. Revelation 4 refers to elders who worship the Lord and "lay their crowns" before Him (Revelation 4:10). "Alpha and Omega" refers to Jesus Christ (Rev.1:8,11, 21:6, 22:13). "Whoever is unjust... etc" is a quote from Revelation 22:11.
