The F4i's new bodywork carries a more racy look and provides a 3% reduction in drag. It also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40% brighter H7 bulbs compared to the old H4 bulbs.[15]  The headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens.  The turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher and closer to the rider. The elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger air box and a larger 4.8 US gal (18 l; 4.0 imp gal) fuel tank. And a fuel consumption of 36.7 mpg‑US (6.41 L/100 km; 44.1 mpg‑imp).[17]
