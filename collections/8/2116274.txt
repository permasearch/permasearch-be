The Kwik-E-Mart (spelled "Quick-E-Mart" in "Bart the General") is a fictional convenience store in the animated television series The Simpsons. It is a parody of American convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Wawa Inc., and depicts many of the stereotypes about them. It is notorious for its high prices and the poor quality of its merchandise. The operator of the Springfield store is an Indian-American named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.[1] It was first seen in the episode "The Telltale Head" and has since become a common setting in The Simpsons.
