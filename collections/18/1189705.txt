As Cyclone Kathy neared the Australia coastline later on 22 March, it began to weaken as it interacted with land.[2] Radar imagery depicted the system as having an eye 10.8 km (6.7 mi) in diameter.[5] Roughly 5 hours after peaking, the storm passed directly over the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands, resulting in a degrading structure.[2][5] Near midnight, the system weakened to a Category 4 cyclone and made landfall in a remote region near Borroloola.[6] Based on a wind gust to sustained ratio of 1.4, Kathy was estimated to have moved onshore with winds between 165 and 185 km/h (105 and 115 mph).[5][7] In the hours after landfall, Kathy rapid weakened, no longer retaining gale-force winds once 200 km (120 mi) away from the Gulf on 23 March. Later that day, the system turned south-westward and persisted for another 24 hours before dissipating.[2]
