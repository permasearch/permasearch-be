In his second career game, a 30â€“23 home loss to the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers, Newton broke his own record, set the weekend previously, with 432 yards passing, throwing and rushing for a touchdown.[63] Newton's 854 passing yards through the first two games of the season, the most in league history by a rookie,[64] broke the NFL record of 827 set by Kurt Warner in the 2000 season and stood as the most by any quarterback in the first two weeks of the season until New England's Tom Brady broke the mark again later in the day with 940.[64] He also became the only player to begin his career with consecutive 400-yard passing games[65] and broke the Carolina Panthers franchise record of 547 yards previously held by Steve Beuerlein.[66] After Newton's second career game, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers commented, "I think someone said in the locker room that I'm kind of glad we played him early in the season because when he figures it out fully, he's going to be even tougher to stop."[66] Newton's three additional interceptions against the Packers tied him for the most interceptions thrown in the league. His total passing yards over the first three games was 1,012 yards.
