In August 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that Joe Ledington of Kentucky, a nephew by marriage of Colonel Sanders, had claimed to have found a copy of the original KFC fried chicken recipe on a handwritten piece of paper in an envelope in a scrapbook.[20] Tribune staffers conducted a cooking test of this recipe, which took several attempts to get right.[20] First, they had to determine whether the "Ts" meant tablespoons or teaspoons; they soon concluded the correct interpretation was tablespoons.[20] They claimed that with some trial and error and the addition of MSG as a flavor enhancer, they produced fried chicken which tasted "indistinguishable" from fried chicken they had purchased at KFC.[20]
