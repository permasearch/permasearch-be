On 17 June 1974, a 9-kilogram (20Â lb) bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded in Westminster Hall. The explosion and the resulting fire, which was fed by a ruptured gas main, injured 11 people and caused extensive damage.[154] Five years later, a car bomb claimed the life of Airey Neave, a prominent Conservative politician, while he was driving out of the Commons car park in New Palace Yard. The attack occurred on 30 March 1979, one day after the announcement of that year's general election;[155] both the Irish National Liberation Army and the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for Neave's assassination,[156] but it is now accepted that the former were responsible.[157][158]
