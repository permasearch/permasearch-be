In elephants the breeding season is less pronounced than in other ungulates and it usually spikes when the rains season occurs or shortly thereafter.[17][1] The rut is observed in both African and Asian elephants and it is referred to as musth.[18] Its meaning is derived from the Urdu word mast meaning intoxication. The most prominent characteristics of an elephant in rut are heightened sexual and aggressive activity along with copious temporal gland secretion and continual urine discharge.[1][19] Also it has been observed that males will have a higher concentration of testosterone and an increased likelihood of associating with female groups during musth. Similarly to deer or mountain goats, elephants will tusk the ground throwing vegetation, logs and objects into the air and occasionally at other subordinates.[1]
