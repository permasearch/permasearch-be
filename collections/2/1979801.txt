In some parts of Asia and the Middle East, the riding of stallions is widespread, especially among male riders.  The gelding of stallions is unusual, viewed culturally as either unnecessary or unnatural. In areas where gelding is not widely practised, stallions are still not needed in numbers as great as mares, and so many will be culled, either sold for horsemeat or simply sold to traders who will take them outside the area.  Of those that remain, many will not be used for breeding purposes.
