Erik Thomson plays George Turner, a recent widower who quits his job as a popular 800 word columnist for a top selling Sydney newspaper. Over the internet he buys a house on an impulse in a fictional New Zealand remote seaside town called Weld. He then has to break the news to his two teenage kids, Shay and Arlo (Melina Vidler and Benson Jack Anthony), who just lost their mother, and now face an even more uncertain future. But the colourful and inquisitive locals ensure Turner's dream of a fresh start does not go exactly to plan.[5]
