The most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that     ϵ   {\displaystyle \epsilon }   is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render      β  1     {\displaystyle \beta _{1}}   identifiable.[17] An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by Card (1999).[18]
