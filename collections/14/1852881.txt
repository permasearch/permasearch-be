Former Chief Minister of Gujarat, Now Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi has been very bent on the issue of the holy river, and has promised the Parliament of India to get the holy river clean and out of misery, as the density of coli-form bacteria have risen from 5,000 per 100ml to 58,000 per 100ml, which is 11.6 over the acceptable limit. So far, Rs 20,000 crore has gone into the cleaning of the Ganga. From household waste to construction debris, from used irrigation water containing fertilizer and pesticides to industrial waste, from people bathing in the river to ashes immersed in it, the Ganga is abused. Shri. Modi has offered the gifts he received during his tenure as PM of the nation for bidding. The amount received from the bidding will be utilized for the cause.
