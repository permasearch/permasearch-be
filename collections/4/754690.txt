Cells found in the gastric glands include foveolar cells, chief cells, parietal cells, G cells and enterochromaffin-like cells (ECLs). The first cells of all of the glands are foveolar cells in the neck regionâ€“also called mucous neck cells that produce mucus. This is thought to be different from the mucus produced by the gastric mucosa.
