From 1952 through October 1967, E4s were titled "Airman First Class" (A/1c) and there was no rank titled "Sergeant", though A/1cs were often called "sarge" or "sergeant" informally. During the period when the E4 title was "Sergeant", senior airmen, earlier known as Airmen Second Class (A/2c, pay grade E3), were promoted to sergeant and granted non-commissioned officer status after 12 months time in grade; this lateral promotion is no longer conferred and senior airmen compete directly for promotion to staff sergeant.  The current title for airmen at the E4 grade is "Senior Airman". From 1976 - 1995) senior airman rank insignia had a subdued central star (light blue vice silver for sergeant and above), as did airman first class (E3) and airman (E2) (Airman Basic, E1, has no rank insignia).
