Each ICANN-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million.[1] The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices.
