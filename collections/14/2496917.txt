A famous poet and composer of songs, active in the early Middle Ages, was the philosopher Peter Abelard (1079â€“1142). Abelard's son Astrolabe[12] had a prebend in the monastery of Benediktbeuern,[citation needed] so it is possible that the Carmina Burana began as the personal collection of his father's works.
