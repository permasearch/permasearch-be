On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired Gizmo5[29] for a reported U.S. $30Â million in cash.[30] A major effect of this announcement was that Gizmo5 suspended new signups pending re-launch by Google.[31] Google was reported to be working on a desktop application, though rumors also circulated that the project had been scrapped in favor of a browser-based solution.[32] On August 26, 2010 Gmail accounts with Google Voice were given a function to make and receive calls. Google Voice product manager, Vincent Paquet, confirmed that this function was added through the help of the technology received after the Gizmo5 acquisition.[33] In 2011, the Gizmo5 site closed service to its registered members. As of January 2012, the website is no longer available.
