Although Return to Mayberry was a ratings success, its critical reception was mixed.  A review in The New York Times opined that its "slow pace, extremely modest level of humor and straightforward and predictable plotting make Return to Mayberry a less appealing reunion for the audience than it may have been for its actors."[3] Time discussed the film only when it was in its last days of production, saying, "Even on TV's crowded reunion calendar, Return to Mayberry is a special event", but offering no substantive comment on the merits of the finished product.[4]  More recent reviews have been kinder, calling it "marvelous blast from the past"[1] and a reunion that "worked largely because the producers kept the original flavour of the series yet brought the show up to date".[2]
