There were 3 original prop crates made for "The Crate" segment of the film Creepshow by production designer Cletus Anderson (1938-2007). A bloody crate, formerly owned by director George A. Romero, is owned by David Burian, prop collector and film archivist. The other two crates are owned by KNB FX co-owner Greg Nicotero (who purchased it from special effects artist Tom Savini) and Creepshow soundtrack composer John Harrison.
