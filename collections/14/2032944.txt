The analog of a reflection about a line in hyperbolic space is a reflection about a geodesic, which can be represented in the model as a circle inversion about the circle that represents the geodesic. Rotations and translations can be represented as a combination of two reflections about different geodesics. In the case of rotations, the two geodesics intersect, while in the case of translations, they do not.
