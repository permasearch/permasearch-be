In 1988, the 24-year-old Klinsmann was named German Footballer of the Year. After reaching the 1988–89 UEFA Cup final with Stuttgart (which eventually lost to Diego Maradona's inspired Napoli 1–2 and 3–3), Klinsmann moved to Italian club Inter Milan and joined the ranks of two other German internationals, Lothar Matthäus and Andreas Brehme.
