The first patented cigarette machine was by Juan Nepomuceno Adorno of Mexico in 1847.[17] However, production climbed markedly when another cigarette-making machine was developed in the 1880s by James Albert Bonsack, which vastly increased the productivity of cigarette companies, which went from making about 40,000 hand-rolled cigarettes daily to around 4 million.[18]
