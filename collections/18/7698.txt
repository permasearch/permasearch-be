The United States had permitted the execution and life imprisonment of juvenile offenders, in contravention of the Article 37 of the Convention.[1] In 2005, a Supreme Court decision declared juvenile executions to be unconstitutional as "cruel and unusual punishment";[57][58][59] in 2012, the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders.[60]
