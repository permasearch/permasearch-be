Before reaching Cyrus, the song had been rejected by several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film.[2] Chelsom found what would become "The Climb" while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie.[3] After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded "It's the Climb" on a CD and gave it to him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that "the song was gonna be an integral part of the movie".[3] However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person.[3] Alexander felt the changes amounted to a "substantial amount of the song" and commented, "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line."[3] She and Mabe "wrestl[ed] over taking words out" and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity.[3] After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was "perfect for the movie".[3]
