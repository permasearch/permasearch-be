The Tcl programming language was created in the spring of 1988 by John Ousterhout while working at the University of California, Berkeley.[11][12] Originally "born out of frustration",[8] according to the author, with programmers devising their own languages intended to be embedded into applications, Tcl gained acceptance on its own. John Ousterhout was awarded the ACM Software System Award in 1997 for Tcl/Tk.[13]
