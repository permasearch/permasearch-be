SBAR was first developed by the military,[2] specifically for nuclear submarines. It was then used in the aviation industry, which adopted a similar model before it was put into use in health care.[3] It was introduced to rapid response teams (RRT) at Kaiser Permanente in Colorado in 2002[citation needed], to investigate patient safety. The main purpose was to alleviate communication problems traced from the differences in communication styles between healthcare professionals.[2] SBAR was later adopted by many other health care organizations. It is among the most popular handover mnemonic systems in use.[4]
