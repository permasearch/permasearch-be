When Birdy came to Earth to inspect S.P.D.'s Earth headquarters, his style of tactics clashed with Cruger's (which was to keep the Rangers as a team because that's how he thought they worked best). This led to Cruger's brief expulsion from S.P.D., during which Birdy took command of the Delta Base. After foolishly splitting up the Ranger team, he went out personally to fight Emperor Gruumm and was quickly overwhelmed by Gruumm's superior skill. Luckily, Shadow Ranger, acting against orders, showed up on his ATV and drove Gruumm off. Fowler was at first enraged, but changed his tune after Cruger drew a salute from his fellow Rangers. Birdy departed, commending Cruger for his actions and telling him that the galaxy is depending on him.
