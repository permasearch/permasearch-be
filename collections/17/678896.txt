The song was originally offered to Dionne Warwick, who turned it down at the time,[2] though she later recorded it for her album Here Where There Is Love. (Warwick also recorded a second version in 1996, which scraped the lower reaches of the US Hot 100.) Bacharach initially did not believe in the song, and was reluctant to play it for DeShannon.[3] DeShannon's version was recorded on March 23, 1965, at New York's Bell Sound studios.[4] Bacharach arranged, conducted and produced the session.
