In August 2008, Boscov's Department Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and planned to close several stores, due to financial problems from the widespread recession. They gave up sponsorship of the parade. The Swedish furniture manufacturer IKEA, which has a major store and its North American home office in nearby Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, took over sponsorship until 2010.
