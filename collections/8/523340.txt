In the 2006 season, Schiano's Scarlet Knights raced off to a 9-0 record, highlighted by their November 9 victory over the third-ranked, undefeated Louisville Cardinals. After this game, Rutgers jumped to seventh in the national AP Poll, which was their highest ranking in school history and first Top 25 ranking since 1976.[5] The euphoria from the win and high ranking quickly faded the following week with a loss to Cincinnati, but the Scarlet Knights bounced back to finish 11-2 and qualify for the inaugural Texas Bowl.[6] There, they would defeat the Kansas State Wildcats 37â€“10, capturing their first ever bowl game win in school history.
