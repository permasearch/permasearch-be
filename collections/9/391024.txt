The standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology.[22] To take just a single example, Omri's accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of Asa of Judah (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor Zimri in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15).[23] The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version.[24] A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none has achieved consensus status.[25]
