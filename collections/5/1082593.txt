Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned as screenwriters and completed a draft of the script by April 2007;[266] Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began.[264] Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, "We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not".[267] Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster.[267] Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps,[268] but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire.[269] Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only "a few days" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.[270] Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.[271][169]
