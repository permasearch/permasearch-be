The effects of psychostimulants include increases in heart rate, body temperature, and sweating; improvements in alertness, attention, and endurance; increases in pleasure produced by rewarding events; but at higher doses agitation, anxiety, or even loss of contact with reality.[86] Drugs in this group can have a high addiction potential, due to their activating effects on the dopamine-mediated reward system in the brain.[86] However some can also be useful, at lower doses, for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.[89][90] An important differentiating factor is the onset and duration of action.[86] Cocaine can take effect in seconds if it is injected or inhaled in free base form; the effects last from 5 to 90 minutes.[91] This rapid and brief action makes its effects easily perceived and consequently gives it high addiction potential.[86] Methylphenidate taken in pill form, in contrast, can take two hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream,[89] and depending on formulation the effects can last for up to 12Â hours.[citation needed] These slow and sustained actions reduce the potential for abuse and make it more useful for treating ADHD.[89][not in citation given]
