The design was based on Infiniti Essence (crescent-cut C-pillar, deep body section, asymmetrical cabin layout, interior finishes) and Infiniti Etherea (headlights, three-dimensional double-arch grille, interior finishes).[2] The production Q50 design was frozen in June 2011, after being designed by Joel Baek under Shiro Nakamura.
