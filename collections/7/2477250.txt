Since July 2007, Nye and environmental activist Ed Begley, Jr. have engaged in a friendly competition "to see who could have the lowest carbon footprint", according to Begley.[82] In a 2008 interview, Nye joked that he wants to "crush Ed Begley" in their environmental competition.[83] Nye and Begley are neighbors in Los Angeles and sometimes dine together at a local vegetarian restaurant.[83] Nye often appeared on Begley's HGTV/Planet Green reality show Living with Ed.
