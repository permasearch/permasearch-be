The race condition is removed by adding in logic redundancy, which is contrary to the aims of using a k-map in the first place. Both minterm race conditions are covered by addition of the yellow term     A   D ¯     {\displaystyle A{\overline {D}}}  . (The maxterm race condition is covered by addition of the green-bordered grey term     A +   D ¯     {\displaystyle A+{\overline {D}}}  .)
