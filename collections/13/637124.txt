In post-trial interviews, a few of the jurors said that they believed Simpson probably did commit the murders,[72] but that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Three jurors together wrote and published a book called Madam Foreman,[73] in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered prosecutor Darden to be a token black assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office.[64]
