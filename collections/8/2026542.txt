In 1976, "At the Hop" was re-issued, and it made its way into the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The single was commercially used for the Canadian National Exhibition, changing the words to "Let's go to the Ex" rather than "Let's go to the hop." It was parodied by the band Dash Rip Rock with their single entitled "Letâ€™s Go Smoke Some Pot", and by NRBQ during the 1973 energy crisis under the title, "Get That Gasoline".
