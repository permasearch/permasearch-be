Kidd appeared in supporting roles as a character actor in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his performance as the faded, cynical choreographer for a cheesy beauty pageant in the satirical 1975 film Smile, which starred Bruce Dern. Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd's portrayal of the pageant choreographer a "finely etched semiautobiographical performance".[16] He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film Movie Movie, which was directed by Stanley Donen, with whom he'd worked in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and It's Always Fair Weather. Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy Laverne and Shirley (1990), as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos, When I Think of You (1986) and Alright (1990).[4] He conceived and choreographed the television special Baryshnikov in Hollywood, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov, in 1982,[17] for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.[18]
