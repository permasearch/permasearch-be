Libya imports up to 90% of its cereal consumption requirements, and imports of wheat in 2012/13 was estimated at about 1 million tonnes.[179] The 2012 wheat production was estimated at about 200,000 tonnes.[179] The government hopes to increase food production to 800,000 tonnes of cereals by 2020.[179] However, natural and environmental conditions limit Libya’s agricultural production potential.[179] Before 1958, agriculture was the country’s main source of revenue, making up about 30% of GDP. With the discovery of oil in 1958, the size of the agriculture sector declined rapidly, comprising less than 5% GDP by 2005.[180]
