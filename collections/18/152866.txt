Long popular among coffee enthusiasts in the U.S.,[citation needed] iced coffee is quickly gaining popularity among the general consumer audience as evidenced by the fact that it is available in mass food franchises such as Dunkin' Donuts and sold bottled in grocery stores. Iced coffee is prepared many different ways, though traditionalists[who?] maintain that true iced coffee is cold brewed using one of a number of ways. Cold brew coffee contains up to 70% fewer bitter acids than heat brewed coffee, making for a smoother, richer tasting coffee drink.[citation needed]
