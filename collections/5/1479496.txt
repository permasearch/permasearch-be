Following Ryan's eviction, the HouseGuests held strong in the Slippery Slope Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must hold onto their rope, trying to stay on their candy for as long as possible. If they step off, they will be eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Johnny was the winner. As Head of Household, Johnny was required to name two Have-Nots for the week. He selected Derek and Kaela. On Day 49, Johnny nominated Derek and Kaela for eviction. On Day 50, Johnny, Derek, and Kaela, alongside Alejandra, Maddy, and Paras, raced in the Downloaded Power of Veto competition. In each round of the competition, HouseGuests were asked a question about a series of images. They must watch the monitor to identify the correct images, run along the track, and place the images on their computer. The last HouseGuest to place the correct images in each round will be eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto, as well as $5000. Derek was the winner. On Day 52, Derek decided to take himself off the block, and Johnny named Alejandra as the replacement nominee. On Day 55, Alejandra was evicted by a 4-1 vote, with Olivia voting to evict Kaela. She became the second member of the jury. Arisa then informed the HouseGuests of the Triple Eviction. The HouseGuests were then tested in the Name That Speech Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests were read a series of quotes made at a previous ceremony. They must identify who made the quote. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Derek was the winner. He immediately nominated Johnny, Maddy, and Olivia for eviction. Everyone except Derek then grappled in the Drawbridge to Veto Power of Veto competition. In this competition, each HouseGuest had a drawbridge with four missing planks. They must complete their drawbridge with four planks of the HouseGuests who have won Head of Household and the Power of Veto in the same week, with the earliest occurrence at the bottom. In order to release their planks, they must spin around their posts. The first HouseGuest to correctly complete their drawbridge, lower it, and hit their button will win the Power of Veto. Kaela was the winner. At the Veto Meeting, Kaela decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 55, Johnny and Olivia were evicted by a 3-0-0 vote. They became the third and fourth members of the jury.
