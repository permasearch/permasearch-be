The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test is a diagnostic test for syphilis. Using antibodies specific for the Treponema pallidum species, such tests would be assumed to be more specific than non-treponemal testing such as VDRL, but have been shown repeatedly to be sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in CSF. In addition, FTA-ABS turns positive earlier and remains positive longer than VDRL. Other treponemes, such as T. pertenue, may also produce a positive FTA-ABS.  The ABS suffix refers particularly to a processing step used to remove nonspecific antispirochetal antibodies present in normal serum.
