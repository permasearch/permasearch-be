Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German. A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.[132] As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their dialects.[133] However, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may provide suggested figures. An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French. French-speaking Belgians are often referred to as Walloons, although the French speakers in Brussels are not Walloons.[F]
