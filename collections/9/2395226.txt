In 2014, a mashup of McEntire's version of "Fancy" and Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's hit recording of the same title surfaced on the Internet. The mashup, which replaces the Charli XCX-sung chorus in Azalea's hit with the chorus from McEntire's "Fancy," was reviewed favorably by the country-music website TasteOfCountry.com.[7]
