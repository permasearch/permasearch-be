The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture. "Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades, but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music," said Haynes.[166] "We sure didn’t set out to be a "jam band" but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t want to just play three minutes and be over," said Allman.[167] Rolling Stone referred to the group as "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached."[168]
