The Keio Line concourse is located to the west of the Odakyu line concourse, two floors below ground level under Keio department store. It consists of three platforms stretching north to south. Approximately 720,000 passengers use this section daily, which makes it the busiest amongst the non-JR Group railways of Japan. This suburban commuter line links Shinjuku to the city of Hachi≈çji to the west.[2] Chest-high platform edge doors were introduced on the Keio Line platforms in March 2014.[3] The doors are different colours for each platform. The doors on platform 2 are green.[3]
