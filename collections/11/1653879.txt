If metal oxides are used carbon dioxide is formed as a reaction product. In the reduction of metal chlorides with carbon monoxide phosgene is formed, as in the preparation of osmium carbonyl chloride from the chloride salts.[31] Carbon monoxide is also suitable for the reduction of sulfides, where carbonyl sulfide is the byproduct.
