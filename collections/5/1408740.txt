In 1979, the government heavily promoted Mandarin through its Speak Mandarin campaign. The then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew stated that Mandarin was chosen to unify the Chinese community with a single language.[30] With the rising prominence of Mandarin in Singapore at that time,[1] politicians such as Lee theorized that it might overtake English,[31] despite strong evidence to the contrary.[32] From the 1990s, with the perceived increase in commerce and trade possibilities with Mainland China, the Singaporean government promoted Mandarin as a language with high economic advantage and value.[33] Today, Mandarin is generally seen as a way to maintain a link to Chinese culture.[29]
