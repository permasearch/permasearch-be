The political history of Pakistan (Urdu: پاکستان کی سیاسی تاريخ‎) is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, and leaders of Pakistan. Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom on 14 August 1947, when British India was divided by the United Kingdom, in a region what is commonly referred to as the South Asia. Since its independence, Pakistan has had a colorful yet turbulent political history at times, often characterized by martial law and inefficient governments.
