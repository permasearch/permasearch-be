Television commentators have noted the series' study of personal identity. This theme is explored most candidly through Don Draper's identity fraud during the Korean War, in which he takes on another soldier's name in order to leave the war. Tim Goodman considers identity to be the show's overriding theme, calling Don Draper "a man who's been living a lie for a long time. He's built to be a loner. And over the course of three seasons we've watched him carry this existential angst through a fairy-tale life of his own creation."[58]
