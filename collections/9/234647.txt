While Shia make up roughly 15% of Saudi Arabia's population,[155] they form a large portion of the residents of the eastern province of Hasa—by some estimates a majority[156]—where much of the petroleum industry is based. Between 500,000 and a million Shia live there,[157] concentrated especially around the oases of Qatif and Al-Hasa. The Majority of Saudi Shia belong to the sect of the Twelvers.[158]
