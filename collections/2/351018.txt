Michael OrdoÃ±a of the Los Angeles Times gave it a positive review, noting the slower cut of the film and saying "the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable. Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck".[77] Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five praising the use of 3D, while stating that the Resident Evil films "always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination".[78] Chicago Reader's Andrea Gronvall described the plot as "nearly indiscernible" but did call the film the "sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit".[79]
