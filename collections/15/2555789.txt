Without LTFS, data is generally written to tape as a sequence of nameless "files", or data blocks, separated by "filemarks". Each file is typically an archive of data organized using some variation of tar format or proprietary container formats developed for and used by backup programs.   In contrast, LTFS utilizes an XML-based index file to present the copied files as if organized into directories.  This means LTFS-formatted tape media can be used similarly to other removable media (USB flash drive, external hard disk drive, and so on).
