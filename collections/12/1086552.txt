Criticism of the National Food Security Bill includes accusations of both political motivation and fiscal irresponsibility.[13][14][15][16] One senior opposition politician, Murli Manohar Joshi, went so far as to describe the bill as a measure for "vote security" (for the ruling government coalition) rather than food security.[13] Another political figure, Mulayam Singh Yadav, declared, "It is clearly being brought for elections...Why didnâ€™t you bring this bill earlier when poor people were dying because of hunger?...Every election, you bring up a measure. There is nothing for the poor."[17]
