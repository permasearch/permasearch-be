Brooklyn is a given name that has increased in popularity for girls in the United States and Canada in recent years.[citation needed] It has occasionally been used as a name in honor of Brooklyn, the New York City borough, but is usually regarded as simply a combination of the names Brook or Brooke, a name derived from an English surname meaning "one who lives near a brook" and the suffix -lyn, which is an element in other popular contemporary names in the United States such as Kaitlyn.
