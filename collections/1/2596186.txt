The threads on a right-handed screw are a right-handed helix. They are basically a long inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder such that turning the screw advances the screw back and forth along the z-axis. From the point of view of the external threads, turning the screw forces the screw up or down the inclined plane. If a screw is right-handed (most screws are) the rule is this: point your right thumb in the direction you want the screw to go and turn the screw in the direction of your curled right fingers.
