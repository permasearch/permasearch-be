The lipogrammatic novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn is built entirely around the "Quick Brown Fox" pangram and its inventor. It depicts a fictional country off the South Carolina coast that idealizes the pangram, chronicling the effects on literature and social structure as various letters are banned from daily use by government dictum.[11]
