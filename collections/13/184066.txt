An early stage of hyperthermia can be "heat exhaustion" (or "heat prostration" or "heat stress"), whose symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse.  If the condition progresses to heat stroke, then hot, dry skin is typical[8] as blood vessels dilate in an attempt to increase heat loss.  An inability to cool the body through perspiration may cause the skin to feel dry.
