Super Mario Bros. 3 was re-released as a downloadable Virtual Console title in 2007 for the Wii and in 2014 for both the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U consoles. These versions support multiple console-specific controllers, such as the Wii Remote or the Wii U GamePad, and allow players to save progress with the use of save states.[78][79] The game was included as one of thirty pre-installed NES titles included with the NES Classic Edition plug and play console.[19]
