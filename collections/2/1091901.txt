Archer uses the standard setup of a workplace comedy, featuring "subversively unlikeable" characters playing off bawdy, reference-heavy humor,[42][43] rapid-fire dialogue,[44] and interaction-based drama.[45] Cultural references on Archer cover a wide spectrum of society and the human condition, in film, literature and music for example.[46][47][48][49] Some—chiefly references to literature—are obscure, and the audience often may not notice them in a single viewing.[50] Reed cites his time as a university English major as the primary forebear for the show's literary references.[47] Archer also develops a unique self-referentiality through character-based jokes, catchphrases, and running gags that evolve over multiple episodes.[51][41] For example, Sterling or another character may yell "phrasing" in response to any sexually suggestive remark.[52][53] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times argues that Archer uses "a caustic brand of humor that isn't for everybody but that has brought the show a dedicated fan base."[54]
