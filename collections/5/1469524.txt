A key factor in income inequality/equality is the effective rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax in which the effective tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases.[94][95][96][97][98] Overall income tax rates in the U.S. are below the OECD average, and until 2005 have been declining.[99]
