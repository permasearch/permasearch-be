Angelica's parents, Drew and Charlotte, are hardly ever around because of their jobs, so her aunt and uncle, Didi and Stu, often babysit her. Her parents rarely punish or discipline her, so it's usually up to her aunt and uncle to do so. One of the few times that Angelica was ever visibly punished/disciplined by her parents is in the episode "Runaway Angelica", father yells at and punished her for disobeying her father's orders of not going into her father's home office. Most other times, her parents just scold her instead of threatening her with punishment for her bad behavior.
