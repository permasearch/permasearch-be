Risk associated with project outcomes is usually handled using probability theory. This can be factored into the discount rate (to have uncertainty increasing over time), but is usually considered separately. Particular consideration is often given to risk aversionâ€”the preference for avoiding loss over achieving gain. Expected return calculations do not account for the detrimental effect of uncertainty.[citation needed]
