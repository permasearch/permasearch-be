It had long been a practice at the Mint to recut unused dies at the end of the year to show the following year's date.  During the 18th and 19th centuries, die cutting was difficult and expensive.  As making dies became cheaper and easier, the practice mostly died out around the turn of the 20th century.  However, a 1917-S Type 2 die, unused by the San Francisco Mint, was recut and used to strike several thousand 1918-S quarters.[54]  Few are known, and the coins command prices in the low thousands even in well-circulated conditions.[55]
