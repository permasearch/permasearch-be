Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere envelops its ring system and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites.[62] Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis.[63] The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries.[64] In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.[62]
