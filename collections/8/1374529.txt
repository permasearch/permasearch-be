The Oculus rift is increasingly used in universities and schools as an educational tool[83]. The ability to provide an immersive, engaging environment can assist a diverse range of students for learning. In particular, there appears to be benefits to medical, health science and exercise students when utilising the Oculus Rift as a supplement for content provided in anatomy and physiology[84]. There is also an increasing uptake of the oculus rift within curricula in other fields such as marketing, architecture, clinical education[85], computer science and paramedics[86].
