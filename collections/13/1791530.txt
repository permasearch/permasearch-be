The Nepal Railways Corporation has a good safety record. In August 2012, a serious incident occurred when a locomotive ran away after the driver alighted for refreshment. The unmanned locomotive ran from Jaynagar to Janakpur at speeds far exceeding the restrictions on the line. At Janakpur, staff diverted the light engine onto a disused siding, on which they had placed heavy obstructions. The engine was halted and no-one was injured.[4]
