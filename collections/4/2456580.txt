The series was initially set to debut on March 7, 2018.[22] However, on February 28, 2018, it was announced that the premiere would be delayed in light of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[23] Paramount Network released a statement explaining their decision saying, "Paramount Network’s original series Heathers is a satirical comedy that takes creative risks in dealing with many of society’s most challenging subjects ranging from personal identity to race and socio-economic status to gun violence. While we stand firmly behind the show, in light of the recent tragic events in Florida and out of respect for the victims, their families and loved ones, we feel the right thing to do is delay the premiere until later this year."[24] On May 1, 2018, Paramount Network announced that the series would officially premiere on July 10, 2018.[25]
