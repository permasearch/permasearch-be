The Mayor of Townsville is Jenny Hill, a member of the Labor Party. Hill was elected in April 2012, replacing the retiring Les Tyrell and defeating main opposing candidate Dale Last.[38][39] Tyrell was the immediate past Mayor for 17 years of the former local government authority, the City of Thuringowa. The previous Mayor of Townsville for 19 years was Tony Mooney (Australian Labor Party). Hill faced a largely hostile chamber in her first term, with 'Townsville First' candidates winning the majority of divisions.[38] When local government elections were held in March 2016, Jenny Hill was re-elected as Mayor of Townsville[40] while all ten of her Team Jenny Hill candidates (which included two sitting councillors) won in their respective divisions.
