Labilliere moved to Dorking from Chiswick in around 1789,[37] living in a small cottage called "The Hole in the Wall," on Butter Hill,[41] and often visiting Box Hill to meditate.[42] With old age he became increasingly eccentric and neglected his own personal hygiene to such an extent that he acquired the nickname "the walking dung-hill".[42] He died on 6 June 1800.[41] In accordance with his wishes he was buried head downwards, on 10 or 11 June on the western side of Box Hill above The Whites. In the presence of a crowd of thousands that included visitors from London as well as the local "quality gentry",[41][43] Labilliere was buried without any religious ceremony, having reportedly said that the world was "topsy-turvey" and that it would be righted in the end if he were interred thus. But this preference was not mentioned in his "Book of Devotions": rather he there said that he wished to emulate the example of St Peter, who was crucified upside-down according to tradition.[44][note 3]
