When Al accidentally rips off Woody's arm, Stinky Pete secretly leaves his box and he sabotages Woody's attempt to recover his arm and return to Andy by turning on the TV. He then frames Jessie for this by putting the TV remote near her before returning to his box and pretending that he "doesn't know" how the TV turned on after Woody falls for his trick. He later convinces Woody to wait until his arm is supposed to be fixed in the morning, which is done after Al calls in a cleaner. After Woody's arm is fixed, Stinky Pete convinces Woody after a story that Jessie tells him about her old owner, that Andy won't play with him anymore by the time he goes to college, but in Japan, Woody will be treasured forever. Woody agrees to stay with them instead of going back to Andy, much to Stinky Pete, Jessie and Bullseye's delight.
