Traditional Irish music cannot be found in every Irish pub but many feature live Irish music sessions every weekend.[7] Musicians play jigs, reels and other folk songs with bagpipes, fiddles, drums, and flutes. There can be singers as well. Musicians aren't always paid but usually receive free drinks for their music.[9].
