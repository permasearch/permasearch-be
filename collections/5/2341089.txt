The "transition zone" between these near and far field regions, extending over the distance from one to two wavelengths from the antenna,[citation needed] is the intermediate region in which both near-field and far-field effects are important. In this region, near-field behavior dies out and ceases to be important, leaving far-field effects as dominant interactions. (See the "Far Field" image above.)
