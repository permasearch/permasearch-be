First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.[39] The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) to 2017.[117]
