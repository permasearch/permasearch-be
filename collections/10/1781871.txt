The Dharmasastra literature, states Patrick Olivelle, admonishes "people not to cook for themselves alone", offer it to the gods, to forefathers, to fellow human beings as hospitality and as alms to the monks and needy.[5] All living beings are interdependent in matters of food, thus food must be respected, worshipped and taken with care.[5] Olivelle states that the Shastras recommend that when a person sees food, he should fold his hands, bow to it, and say a prayer of thanks.[5] This reverence for food reaches a state of extreme in the renouncer or monk traditions in Hinduism.[5] The Hindu tradition views procurement and preparation of food as necessarily a violent process, where other life forms and nature are disturbed, in part destroyed, changed and reformulated into something edible and palatable. The mendicants (sannyasin, ascetics) avoid being the initiator of this process, and therefore depend entirely on begging for food that is left over of householders.[5] In pursuit of their spiritual beliefs, states Olivelle, the "mendicants eat other people's left overs".[5] If they cannot find left overs, they seek fallen fruit or seeds left in field after harvest.[5]
