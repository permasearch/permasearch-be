This impasse led to the mutiny. The mutineers justified their actions based on other events, including the shooting by Cheap of a drunken insubordinate midshipman called Cozens. Upon hearing of a verbal altercation outside his tent, Cheap approached the young man in a rage and immediately shot him in the face with a pistol at point blank range without any warning. This incident further raised tensions as, on the orders of the Captain, Cozens was then refused medical aid for his wound. Cozens was unable to drink or eat properly and lying wounded in the open in very bad winter conditions subsequently took ten days to die.[17][29]
