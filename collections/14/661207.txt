Astroland owner Carol Hill Albert, whose husband's family had owned the park since 1962, sold the site to Thor in November 2006 for an undisclosed amount. In January 2007, Thor released renderings for a new amusement park to be built on the Astroland site called Coney Island Park.[95] Thor proposed a $1.5 billion renovation and expansion of the Coney Island amusement area to include hotels, shopping, movies, an indoor water park and the city's first new roller coaster since the Cyclone. The Municipal Art Society launched the initiative ImagineConey,[96] in early 2007, as discussion of a rezoning plan that highly favored housing and hotels began circulating from the DCP.[97] MAS held several public workshops, a call for ideas, and a charrette to garner attention to the issue. Astroland closed in 2008[98] and was replaced by a new Dreamland in 2009 and by a new Luna Park in 2010.
