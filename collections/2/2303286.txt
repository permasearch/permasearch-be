The DNA methylation landscape of vertebrates is very particular compared to other organisms. In vertebrates, around 60–80% of CpG are methylated in somatic cells[15] and DNA methylation appears as a default state that has to be specifically excluded from defined locations.[16][17] By contrast, the genome of most plants, invertebrates, fungi or protists show “mosaic” methylation patterns, where only specific genomic elements are targeted, and they are characterized by the alternation of methylated and unmethylated domains.[4][18]
