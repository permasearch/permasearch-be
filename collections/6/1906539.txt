Another study found there was an increase in demand of the VA health system among veterans.  Nearly 250,000 veterans were identified between 2001 and 2007; Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans had a 40 percent utilization rate, compared to only 10 percent of Vietnam veterans.[43]  Veterans were categorized into three groups:  non-mental health diagnosis, non-PTSD mental diagnosis, and PTSD mental diagnosis.[43]  The most prevalent diagnosis was PTSD.  The typical veteran affected by PTSD was male, from the Army or Marines, and a lower-ranked officer.[43]  Veterans with PTSD had a high utilization of the VA system at over 91 percent.[43]
