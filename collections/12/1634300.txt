More than 98 percent of people in Bangladesh speak Bengali, sometimes called Bangla, as their native language.[231][232] Dialects of Bengali are spoken in some parts of the country, which include non-standard dialects (sometimes viewed as separate languages) such as Chatgaiya, Sylheti and Rangpuri. Pakistani Biharis, stranded since 1971 and living in Bangladeshi camps, speak Urdu.[233] Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living in Bangladeshi camps since 1978, speak Rohingya.[234] Several indigenous minority languages are also spoken.
