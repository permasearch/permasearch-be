When Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man who Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber.  Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar.  Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced.  Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations.  Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road.  Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.
