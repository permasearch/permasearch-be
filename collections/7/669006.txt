Representatives for Rose applied in 2015 for reinstatement with Selig's successor, Rob Manfred.[33] However, on December 15, 2015, Manfred rejected the request.  Manfred stated that Rose had not been forthcoming about his gambling and that Rose (who by this time was living in Las Vegas) was still betting on baseball. Although Rose was placing legal bets by this time, MLB has long barred players, managers, and coaches from any form of gambling on baseball, legal or otherwise.  He also felt that Rose did not have "a mature understanding of his wrongful conduct" and the damage it had done to the game.  For these reasons, Manfred concluded that allowing him back in the game would be an "unacceptable risk."[34]
