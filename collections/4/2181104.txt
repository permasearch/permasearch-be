Instead of saying what your problem was, you just launched into an ad hominem of 172. He has, it is true, made his fair share of ad hominems, but he also has made substantive points, and it is, I think, the burden of the person wanting to change the article to present the case for doing so. While I personally think that a vaguer intro sentence would probably work better stylistically, I don't think any case at all has been made for why it is POV. The first sentence simply isn't controversial, except to those who are holders of a radical fringe POV. The opening of Holocaust doesn't mince words just because there are those who say there was no Holocaust. Similarly, just because a very small, and fairly disreputable, group denies that slavery was the main cause of the civil war, and tries to bring the tariff into it, doesn't mean we should kowtow to that view in the article introduction. john 05:33, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
