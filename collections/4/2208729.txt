On October 10, 2017, Ives published an article in The Federalist titled "Illinois Governor Breaks Promise, Sends Nonexistent Tax Dollars To No-Limits Abortions."[12] after Governor Bruce Rauner signed HB-40[13] into law. The bill ensures that abortion remains legal in Illinois even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, while also allowing women with Medicaid and state-employee health insurance to use their coverage for abortions.[14] The article states that "Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill forcing taxpayers to fund abortion at any time, for any reason. The cost of this law could approach $20 million." Illinois law prohibits abortions once a fetus is considered viable (which is around 23â€“24 weeks gestation), except in cases of risks to the life or health of the pregnant person.[15] A fiscal note for HB-40 from the Department of Healthcare and Family Services stated the estimated annual cost for abortion services resulting from House Bill 40 is approximately $1.8 million, which would be 100% GRF funded. Another note a month later updated that cost would be zero cost to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services; offset savings were overlooked in the first filed note.[16]
