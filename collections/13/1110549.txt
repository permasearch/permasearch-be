Linux Mint started in 2006 with a beta release of Linux Mint 1.0, code-named "Ada",[9] based on Kubuntu. Following its release, Linux Mint 2.0 "Barbara" was the first version to use Ubuntu as its codebase. Linux Mint had few users from these early versions until the release of Linux Mint 3.0, "Cassandra."[10][11]
