Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit.[36] According to one legend, Hippasus of Metapontum (ca. 470Â B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.[37][38]
