The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is now produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted.[40] Afterward an immune system antibody to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as anti-HBs. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to HBV infection.[41]
