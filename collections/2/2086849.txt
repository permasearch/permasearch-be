When the first area code plan was introduced in 1947, the state was given area codes 216, 419, 513, and 614. In 1996, 330 and 937 were added as splits. In 1998, 440 and 740 were added as splits. Later, in 2000, 234 and 567 were added as overlays. In 2015, area code 740 was overlaid with 220, relieving its rapid depletion. In 2016, area code 614 was overlaid with 380 in the Columbus/Central Ohio area for the same reason. Area code 283 will be used as an overlay when 513 in Cincinnati/Southwest Ohio reaches its depletion.
