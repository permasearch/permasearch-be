In a normal circulatory system, the volume of blood returning to the heart each minute is approximately equal to the volume that is pumped out each minute (the cardiac output).[8] Because of this, the velocity of blood flow across each level of the circulatory system is primarily determined by the total cross-sectional area of that level.  This is mathematically expressed by the following equation:
