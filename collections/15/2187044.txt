Expanding on that notion, Paul Ramsey claims: "Sonnet 29 says that God disappoints and that the young man redeems".[12] This is to say that the poem is not religious in the institutional way, but rather it is its own kind of religion. Ramsey continues, "Against that heaven, against God, is set the happy heaven where the lark sings hymns. The poem is a hymn, celebrating a truth declared superior to religion."[13] So while Sonnet 29 makes some religious references, Ramsey maintains that these are in fact anti-religious in sentiment.
