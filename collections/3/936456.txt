In 1883, the Liberty Head nickel was issued, featuring designs by Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber. After the coin was released, it was modified to add the word "CENTS" to the reverse because the similarity in size with the half eagle allowed criminals to gild the new nickels and pass them as five dollar coins.[1] An Act of Congress, passed into law on September 26, 1890 required that coinage designs not be changed until they had been in use 25Â years, unless Congress authorized the change.[2] The act made the current five-cent piece and silver dollar exceptions to the twenty-five year rule; they were made eligible for immediate redesign.[3] However, the Mint continued to strike the Liberty Head nickel in large numbers through the first decade of the 20th century.[4]
