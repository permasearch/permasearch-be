The path the Hanly Fire took in 1964, as well as the areas it burned, were very similar to the Tubbs Fire: from Calistoga, along Porter Creek and Mark West Springs roads into Sonoma County, burning homes along Mark West Springs and Riebli roads, through Wikiup, and to Mendocino Avenue, where it stopped, across the street from Journeyâ€™s End Trailer Park.[71] The fire was propelled by 70 mph winds, close to hurricane strength; it initially went east from Calistoga, but on the third day its direction switched, going south-west from Calistoga to Santa Rosa in only about half a day.[69] But the fire only destroyed a few dozen homes, because the area it burned was so sparsely settled in 1964.[72]
