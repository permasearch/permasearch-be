In the United States, burglary rates are highest in August and lowest in February, with weather, length-of-day, and other factors having an effect on rates.[5]  Fall and Winter are peak seasons for burglary in Denmark.[7]  Most residential burglaries occur on weekdays, between 10-11 a.m. and 1-3 p.m, when homes are the least likely to be occupied.[5]  The temporal pattern is reversed for non-residential burglaries, which are more likely to occur at night and on weekends when commercial premises are unattended.[8]
