Eating cured meat products has been linked to a small increase in gastric cancer,[13] as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[14]  The negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and nitrites, as well as nitrosamines which are formed by nitrites reacting with meat.  These risks are generally regarded as minimal, and regulations in the United States limit ingoing nitrites to 156 parts per million (0.0156%) (less for bacon) as a precautionary measure.[citation needed]
