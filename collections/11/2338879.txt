The term common carrier is a common law term, seldom used in continental Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier is referred to as a public carrier[1] (or simply as a carrier). However, public carrier in continental Europe is different from public carrier in British English, where it is a synonym for contract carrier.
