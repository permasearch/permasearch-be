Qi is said to circulate in the meridians. Just as the qi held by each of the zang-fu organs, this is considered to be part of the 'principal' qi (simplified Chinese: 元气; traditional Chinese: 元氣; pinyin: yuánqì) of the body[76] (also called 真氣 Chinese: 真气; pinyin: zhēn qì, ‘’true‘’ qi, or 原氣 Chinese: 原气; pinyin: yuán qì, ‘’original‘’ qi).[77]
