Variants include 当...以前 [當...以前] dāng ... yǐqián ("before ...") and 当...以后 [當...以後] dāng ... yǐhòu ("after ...") (these do not use the relative marker de). In all of these cases the initial dāng may be replaced by 在 zài, or may be omitted. There are also similar constructions for conditionals: rúguǒ/jiǎrú/zhǐyào ... de huà ("if ...") (where huà 话 [話] literally means "narrative, story").
