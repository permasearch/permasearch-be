During World War I in Britain, the minimum height for soldiers was 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm). Thus thousands of men under this height were denied the ability to fight in the war. As a result of pressure to allow them entry, special "Bantam Battalions" were created composed of men who were 5 feet 0 inches (152 cm) to 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm). By the end of the war there were 29 Bantam Battalions of about 1,000 men each. Officers were of normal size.[11]
