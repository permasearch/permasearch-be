"In the Misty Moonlight" is a song written by Cindy Walker. One of the first singers to record the song in 1964 was Jim Reeves: it is included on his posthumous album The Jim Reeves Way. There also have been many other artists who have covered the song, but the most successful version was recorded by Dean Martin in 1964. It was released as a single in 1967 and went to number one on the Easy Listening chart and number forty-six on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] The song was Martin's fifth and final number one on the Easy Listening chart. On the other hand, Jerry Wallace had a #19 hit on Billboard Top 100 when his version was released in 1964, so as far as Billboard Top 100 charts, Wallace had the more successful version. Both Wallace and Martin's versions are high quality and well produced.
