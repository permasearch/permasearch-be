Bill C-3 amendments to the Indian Act (Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act[14] - GEIRA) permitted Aboriginal women reinstated under subsection 6(2) to be eligible for 6(1) status.[15] Creating paragraph 6(1)(c.1) registration, reinstated Aboriginal women could only be eligible for registration under 6(1) if they had non-status children.[15] Since it was the children of Aboriginal women who had been affected by restrictions under subsection 6(2) legal registration, only women who had children were eligible to be registered under subsection 6(1) of the Indian Act. Continuing to place restrictions on the status of reinstated women, Bill C-3 does not remove all gender bias provisions from the Indian Act.
