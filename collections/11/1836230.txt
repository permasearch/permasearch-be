Jaykumar Shah of Planet Bollywood gave the movie 8.5/10 stars, saying that "All in all, this is the best movie to come out from India this year so far. It is gritty, well-paced, extremely well-acted, genre defining, path breaking work of art. The movie is not for the ones who are not comfortable with violence being depicted graphically. If you can digest violence on screen, it is a sure winner."[34]
