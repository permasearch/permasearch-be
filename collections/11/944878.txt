Australia would have a rare opportunity to compete on the world's stage during the teams very first major international tournament as hosts of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. A squad coached by Richard Telfer set out to try to win the tournament on home turf where they were drawn against Japan in the round of 16 (as the tournament was held in the knock-out stage format). A goal in each half, a penalty scored by Graham McMillan on the 26th minutes and then a goal by Irish born striker Frank Loughran on the 61st minutes, was enough to see off Japan.[11] Facing India in the quarter-final stages, two goals from Bruce Morrow saw Australia equalise twice in the first half (first 1–1 and then 2–2). Locked at 2–2 until the 50th minute, India's Neville D'Souza put his side ahead before Krishna Kittu would add another on 80th minutes.[12] It was ultimately an inexperience squad that proved to be reason for the teams disappointing performance in the tournament, with Laurie Schwab from The Age commenting, "Australian soccer has lost a wonderful chance to gain world prominence and the game has suffered a body blow".[13] The advent of cheap air travel in the 1960s allowed Australia to diversified its range of opponents.[7] However, its geographical isolation continued to play a role in its destiny for the next 30 years.[7]
