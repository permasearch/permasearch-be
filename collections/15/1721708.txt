Trey Parker and Matt Stone both professed their love of the episode, but said that it is a polarizing one for the audience, claiming that if a viewer is not on board with the episode's toilet humor, then the whole episode breaks down for them.[1] The creators claimed that young people and women reacted poorly to the episode.[1] Parker said that his father, who is the basis for Randy's character, was very thrilled by the episode.[1]
