A major focus for Kenyatta during the first three and a half years of Kenya's independence were the divisions within KANU itself.[351] Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965.[266] Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party vice president—was divided among eight different politicians.[352] In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU).[353] In its manifesto, the KPU stated that it would pursue "truly socialist policies" like the nationalisation of public utilities and that Kenyatta's government "want to build a capitalist system in the image of Western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that."[354] The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition,[355] thus restoring the country's two party system.[356]
