On December 5, 2016, Brohm was hired by Purdue University to be the head coach of the football team.[114][115][116] Brohm went to work right away on recruiting primarily the offensive and defensive lines as well as wide receiver.[117] Brohm brought in five graduate transfers to help get instant depth,[118] including two offensive linemen and a wide receiver. In his first ever game as head coach, Purdue was defeated 28–35 to #16 Louisville.[119] The following week Brohm achieved his first win at Purdue with a 44–21 victory over Ohio.[120]. The following week, Brohm lead Purdue to a blowout win (35-3) at Missouri[121]. Purdue hosted Michigan the next week in a game that many Purdue fans saw as the turnaround they had been waiting for since Tiller, despite losing 28-10. The game saw a sold out Ross Ade Stadium, its first sell out since 2008 in Joe Tiller's final game as the Purdue Head Coach[122]. Heading into week 8, Jeff Brohm and his team went into High Point Solutions Stadium[123] to face Rutgers as they looked to improve 4-3 on the season, but would fall short on a two-point conversion, losing the game 12-14. However, Purdue would win the 4th game of the season against Lovie Smith's Illinois Team[124][better source needed]. This would be the first time Purdue had won 4 games in one season since Danny Hope's final season at Purdue. In week 13, Purdue went into Iowa and won their biggest game of the season with a 24-15 win over the Hawkeyes. And Purdue would follow up their highest point of the season with a Old Oaken Bucket win against Indiana 31-24. Not only was it a rivalry game, but both teams were 5-6, meaning the winner would become bowl eligible. Purdue's win was the first for the program against their hated rivals since 2012. The six wins was enough to get Purdue into the 2017 Foster Farms Bowl Game, where they would face Arizona. The bowl game made Brohm the only head coach in Purdue history, along with Joe Tiller, to take Purdue to a bowl game in their first season in the position.
