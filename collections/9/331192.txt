Aside from the song's intro and extended ending (or coda), the composition is structured into three patterns of verse and chorus, with the second and third patterns separated by an instrumental section.[24] The song originally contained a fourth verseâ€“chorus combination, but this would be omitted from the officially released recording.[27] Among musicologists discussing "It's All Too Much", Walter Everett describes it as a two-chord composition,[4] whereas Alan Pollack contends that the song's sole chord is G major, although he concedes that transcribers may well list fleeting changes to C major over the choruses. In Pollack's opinion, these sections appear to employ IV (C major) and ii (A minor) chords yet, rather than formal changes, "it all boils down to neighbor tone motion in the inner voices superimposed on to the pedal tone of G in the bass."[24]
