She has claimed to be smarter than Velma, as she concocted a "super helium" during an experiment in which she was testing the metal from the roller coasters at her father's theme park. She also has high computer skills, which she uses to make fake advertisement sites, as well as accurate financial pie charts, though she cannot figure out the traps surrounding the piece of the Planispheric Disc in the ship during the episode "The Night on Haunted Mountain", and causes the events to trick the gang, mainly Fred, into investigating the attack on Fred's friends, so Fred can trip the traps for her.
