The origins of the song are obscure. Variant versions with obscene lyrics exist, notably "Do Your Balls Hang Low?"[2][3] and "Do Your Boobs Hang Low?". These have sometimes been regarded as parody versions of the campfire song,[4] but it is more likely that the obscene versions came first, and that "Do Your Ears Hang Low?" is a sanitized version.[citation needed]
