The late 1820s saw military success. In 1826–1828, another war was fought against Persia. Russia lost almost all recently consolidated territories in the first year, but Russia won the war on highly favourable terms. At the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay, Russia gained Armenia, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan, and Iğdır.[104] In the 1828–29 Russo-Turkish War Russia invaded northeastern Anatolia and occupied the strategic Ottoman towns of Erzurum and Gumushane and, posing as protector and saviour of the Greek Orthodox population, received extensive support from the region's Pontic Greeks. Following a brief occupation, the Russian imperial army withdrew back into Georgia. By the 1830s, Russia had conquered all Persian territories and major Ottoman territories in the Caucasus.[105]
