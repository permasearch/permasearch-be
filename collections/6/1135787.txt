An underbone motorcycle racing series was created in partnership with the government of Malaysia's Ministry of Youth and Culture in 2012 to encourage youth to race in a controlled track environment rather than on the streets.[18] It was designed to have a lower cost of entry than existing underbone series, such as the Malaysian Cub Prix.
