At the beginning of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death.[54] Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train,[55] and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.[56]
