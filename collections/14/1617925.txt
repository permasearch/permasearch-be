Moceanu's national and international successes, combined with her bubbly attitude, earned her attention and a wide fan base both in and out of the gymnastics community.[8] In the months leading up to the 1996 Olympics, she was one of the most recognizable faces of USA Gymnastics, eclipsing more decorated teammates such as Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes. Before the Olympics, she was featured in Vanity Fair[23] and wrote an autobiography, Dominique Moceanu: An American Champion, with Steve Woodward.[24] The book reached No. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[25]
