Wes Anderson and Randall Poster chose the distinctive sound of the balalaika to establish the musical voice of the film[46] and managed to gather two orchestras for a total of 35 balalaika musicians for the recording of the soundtrack including the France-based "Saint Georges" Balalaika Orchestra (fr) and the State Academic Russian Folk Ensemble "Russia" (ru) from Moscow.[47][48] Desplat’s use of the balalaika begins with “Mr. Moustafa” but it returns over and over again.[49] Other instruments in this soundtrack include alphorns, whistles, organ, male choir, bells and cimbalom.[50][51]
