Some Heathens practice forms of divination using runes; as part of this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle, and read accordingly.[174] In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life.[175] It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc or the Younger Futhark.[176] Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, with books on the subject being common in New Age bookstores.[177] Some Heathens practice magic, although this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry because it was not a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe.[178]
