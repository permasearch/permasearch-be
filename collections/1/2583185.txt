Brent crude rose 20 percent in the third quarter, the most for the quarter since 2004, reaching $59.49 during the final week of September. The increase that week resulted from a threat by Turkey to close a pipeline as a result of the Kurdistan vote for independence. Turkey did not act and oil fell 6 percent to $56.00 (including a 2.5 percent drop on October 1) as a result of investors taking advantage of higher prices and forecasts for increased U.S. shale oil production. U.S. CLc1 fell only slightly to $50.42.[328]
