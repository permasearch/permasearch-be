Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) started to acquire land in Chattarpur area to construct the station since September 2006.[2][9][11] Two hectare plot was required for constructing the main Metro station, an electrical sub station, parking space and other utilities.[4] After having land acquisition problems in acquiring three plots for construction, DMRC decided to skip the station. But the gap between the two stations (Qutub Minar and Sultanpur) on either side of Chhatarpur would have been 2.7Â km which is too long for a MRTS system. As the station was expected to see a ridership of about 11,723 passengers daily by 2011 in Vasant Kunj area and the Chhatarpur temple, DMRC decided to construct the station using a special design costing an additional 30 to 50% expense to construct the station within the time frame.[3][4][7][11] The construction work of the station was delayed as the land for the building of the station was acquired by DMRC in October 2009 after prolonged litigation.[9][11] The elevated station was constructed using a unique method using special pre-fabricated/structural steel as the conventional construction technique by concrete would have taken at least 18 to 24 months. The steel structures were fabricated in a factory in Gurgaon. The quality of the construction was then checked through Radiography of the joints and Dye-Penetration Tests (DPT). To ensure quality work, the welding activity was not carried at Chhatarpur and the steel structures had to be joined using bolting arrangements.[4][9]
