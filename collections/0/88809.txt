The shooting occurred in Theater 9 at the Century 16 multiplex (operated by Cinemark), located at the Town Center at Aurora shopping mall[5] at 14300 E. Alameda Avenue.[6] Police said Holmes bought a ticket, entered the theater, and sat in the front row. About 20 minutes into the film, he left theater 9 through an emergency exit door beside the movie screen, with direct access to the lightly used parking area at the back of the complex, while propping the door slightly open with a plastic tablecloth holder.[7] There were about 400 people inside theater 9.[8]
