History A part of the teen scene in 1999, Rianna was known in school for dating a rich bad boy J.T. Hellstrom who wasn't treating her right, and they broke up. Rianna was a part of the Glow by Jabot Kids, a promotion that Jabot ran. Rianna fell for Raul Guittierez and their relationship seemed perfect from the very beginning. Rianna was there for Raul when he had diabetes and it seemed like they were able to handle any problem future would give them, until Raul got careless with his medication and began acting strange again. Rianna was hurt when Raul wanted to break up with her, especially after he asked her for sex. Rianna started dating with J.T. again, convinced that J.T. had finally become a better person, but eventually realized that he was using her again, so she decided to move out of Genoa City. She returned to town once again in time to attend prom with Raul. They were friends again, and Rianna even helped Raul get closer to Brittany Hodges, who started to have feelings for Raul. Rianna left to attend the University of Michigan.
