At the height of their success, the Bloods & Crips became a target for Lil' Keke Loco of the Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips and Niggaz Off The Streets (N.O.T.S.), another gangsta rap group. Keke Loco even dedicated a diss track called "Bustas' on Wax", which was a slander to the original album "Bangin On Wax" and took numerous shots at members of the Bloods & Crips including Bloody Mary, redruM 781, AWOL, Big Wy, Sin Loc, and many more. Criticizing them for collaborating with rival street gangs, Keke Loco considers the members from "Bangin' on Wax", a disgrace to all real Bloods and Crips. "Its disrespectful to all the fallen gang members who lost they life over colors, itâ€™s like spitting on their graves", Loco said.
