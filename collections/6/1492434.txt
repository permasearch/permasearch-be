In his backstory in Street Fighter II, E. Honda is mentioned to have begun his training as a child, singularly focused on becoming the greatest sumo wrestler of all time. He would eventually achieve the highly revered title of "ÅŒzeki" (in the English localization of the early Street Fighter II ports, he is stated as having achieved the title, Yokozuna[3]). Honda became upset that the rest of the world did not view sumo wrestling with the reverence of the Japanese. He entered into the second World Warrior tournament intent on showing everyone that sumo wrestlers rank among the greatest fighters in the world.[4] Beyond this, he yearns also to improve and prove his own strength, as well as earn the title of Yokuzuna.[1] While involved in the tournament, he takes the opportunity to investigate Shadaloo, in response to sumo wrestlers having taken drugs he traced back to the organization. His face painting and culturally-ambiguous name assisted him in his covert operations. Following the tournament and the fall of Shadaloo, Honda returned to Japan where he continued wrestling professionally[5] and continuing to run his bath house and training his disciples.[6]
