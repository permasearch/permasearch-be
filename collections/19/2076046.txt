Clarence Ray Allen (January 16, 1930 â€“ January 17, 2006) was an American criminal who was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison in California for the murders of three people.  At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after John B. Nixon, who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. This record has since been broken by Walter Moody.
