During the era of feudalism in Ancient China (Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period), the title of gōng (公, conventionally translated as "Duke") was sparingly granted.  In a tradition called "Three Deferences and Two Royal Descendants" (三恪二王後), the three former royal houses were granted the title of Duke.  For the Zhou dynasty, this would be the descendants of the Xia Dynasty and Shang Dynasty; their dukedoms were respectively the states of Qi (杞) and Song (宋).  When the rulers of these states called at the Zhou court, the king greeted them as equals, out of deference of their former status as royalty.
