A notable exception to the "no pointed bullets" guideline for bullet selection in rifles with tubular magazines are the new flexible "memory elastomer"-tipped Leverevolution cartridges as produced by Hornady.[11] The soft tips of these bullets easily deform under compression, preventing detonations while under recoil in the magazine, yet also return to their original pointed shape when that pressure is removed, thus allowing for a more efficient bullet shape than previously available to load safely in such rifles. The more aerodynamic shape results in a flatter bullet trajectory and greater retained velocity downrange, significantly increasing the effective range of rifles chambered for this cartridge.[12][13] However, the Leverevolution ammunition was designed for longer barreled rifles such as the Marlin XLR (extreme long range) which features a 24-inch barrel. Shooters are consistently finding the Leverevolution rounds are loaded too hot and do not group well with standard 20-inch barrels. Groups of three to four inches at 100 yards are common when using Leverevolution out of 20-inch barrels, rendering the rifle highly inaccurate at longer ranges.
