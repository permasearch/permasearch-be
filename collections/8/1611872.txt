The band's UK success saw them nominated for the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Group.[36] In October 1988, the power ballad "Love Bites" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[33] In January 1989, the band scored another US TopÂ 5 hit with "Armageddon It", and by spring of 1989 the final single "Rocket" was in the Top 20.[33] Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the 7 singles but also the Album tracks that Radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed "Tear It Down", a Hysteria B-side at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. Due to positive fan reaction the song was reworked for their following album Adrenalize.
