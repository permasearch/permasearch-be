There are people who do not profess any faith (such as atheists and agnostics) in Pakistan, but their numbers are not known.[56] They are particularly in the affluent areas of the larger cities. Some were born in secular families while others in religious ones. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population, but social pressure against claiming no religion was strong.[20] A 2012 study by Gallup Pakistan found that people not adhering to any religion account for 1% of the population.[57]
