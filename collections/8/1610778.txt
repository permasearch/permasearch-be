The next night, Devon and Kirk arrive at the Andy Warhol Museum and return Molly's phone, but after accidentally spilling a drink on the museum director they are told to leave. Molly, the event's planner, feels sorry about what happened and offers Kirk tickets to a  hockey game. Kirk brings Stainer to the game, where they meet Molly and her best friend Patty. Kirk assumes Molly meant to set him up with Patty, until Patty explicitly tells Kirk that Molly is interested in him. Later, Molly directly asks Kirk out and he agrees. Stainer predicts their relationship will fail, as he deems Molly a "10" in a scale of attractiveness, and Kirk only a "5", and the gap is too large to overcome. Separately, Patty believes Molly has only chosen Kirk because he is "safe", after being hurt by her last boyfriend. While on their date, Kirk confides in Molly that he dreams of becoming a pilot, while Molly shares her story of how she was once a lawyer before realizing her love for event planning.
