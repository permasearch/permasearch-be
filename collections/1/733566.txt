Historically, the death of a partner was a major cause of single parenting.[1] Single parenting can also result from the breakup or divorce of coupled parents who leave and choose to not co-parent, thus leaving one parent to raise and support the child on their own. Many people confuse single parenting with co-parenting:[citation needed] co-parenting involves both parents playing a role of supporting and raising the child, rather than one parentâ€”as is the case with single parenting. Recent years have seen the increasing incidence and visibility of uncoupled women who choose to be single parents. When single women seek to get pregnant intentionally in order to become single mothers by choice (or "choice moms"), they often seek an anonymous or known sperm donor. Single-parent adoption or fostering is also sometimes an option for single adults who want to raise a family.
