Accurate weather reporting was important to the sea war and on September 18, 1943, U-537 sailed from Kiel, via Bergen, Norway, with a meteorological team led by Professor Kurt Sommermeyer. They landed at Martin Bay, a remote location near the northern tip of Labrador on October 22, 1943 and successfully set up an automatic weather station ("Weather Station Kurt" or "Wetter-FunkgerÃ¤t Land-26"), despite the constant risk of Allied air patrols.[28] The station was powered by batteries that were expected to last about three months.[29] At the beginning of July 1944, U-867 left Bergen to replace the equipment, but was sunk en route.[28] The weather station remained at the site until it was recovered in the 1980s and placed in the Canadian War Museum.
