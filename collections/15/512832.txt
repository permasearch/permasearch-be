In the years following their conquest, the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus identified elite native groups such as the priesthood of Judea â€“ to help him rule his new subjects.[42] No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.[42] The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and have to be replaced.[42] The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.[42] In the past, Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline.[43] Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place-men. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely.[43] On the eve of the Greco-Persian wars, it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.[44]
