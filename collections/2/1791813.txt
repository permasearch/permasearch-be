By around 3000 BC, Ancient Egyptians knew how to assemble wooden planks into a hull.[15] They used woven straps to lash the planks together,[15] and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.[15][16] The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: "During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries B. C., the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country."[17] Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.[18]
