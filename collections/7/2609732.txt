It is believed that only 5â€“50% of those infected in the United States and Canada are aware of their status.[61] Testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes injection drug users, those who have received blood transfusions before 1992,[69] those who have been in jail, those on long term hemodialysis,[70] and those with tattoos.[61] Screening is also recommended in those with elevated liver enzymes, as this is frequently the only sign of chronic hepatitis.[71] Routine screening is not currently recommended in the United States.[15] In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a recommendation for a single screening test for those born between 1945 and 1965.[72]
