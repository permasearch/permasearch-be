One feature of Riverfront that was an improvement compared to some of its fellow "cookie-cutters" was the fact that the lower level field box ("blue") seats for baseball from home plate to the left field foul line were movable in an arc along curved tracks so that the field level seats on both sidelines in the football configuration were parallel to, and thus closer to, the football field than in some of the other cookie-cutter stadia.[3] The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games. (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets moved to Giants Stadium in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted Shea for exclusive baseball use.[4] A variation of this design was also used at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh.)[5]
