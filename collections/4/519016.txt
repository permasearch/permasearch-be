Disregarding the convention of choosing the most senior MLA as the Protem Speaker, the Governor appointed BJP MLA K. G. Bopaiah to the post.[74] The Congress challenged this in the Supreme Court, noting that Bopaiah was not the most senior MLA, and also that he had a bad track record as the speaker.[75] The Supreme Court allowed Bopaiah to stay as the Protem Speaker, but asked for the live broadcasting of the floor test on all channels.[76]
