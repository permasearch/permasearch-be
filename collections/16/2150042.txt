After the Blackest Night storyline, the resurrected Osiris returns to Khandaq, vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity. Osiris takes the petrified bodies of Adam and Isis and flies off to an unknown destination.[18] After failing to revive Adam and Adriana, Osiris enlists in Deathstroke's new team of Titans in hopes of finding a way to save them.[19] He has been told to resurrect Isis, but not Adam, which he does by killing people with his lightning by saying Isis.[citation needed]
