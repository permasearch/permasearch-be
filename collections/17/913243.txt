Although White Castle originated in Wichita, Kansas, the city has not had a branch since 1938, nor is there a White Castle restaurant in the entire state of Kansas. White Castle is one of the few restaurant chains that does not have a location in its original city.[33] White Castle is also unusual in that their store locations include a region that is essentially a significant "exclave" to its primary area.  It has many stores in metropolitan New York City, though the next nearest location outside the metropolitan area is located hundreds of miles away in the Midwest.
