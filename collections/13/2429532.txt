MSU kept the great play up in the second half, scoring their fourth touchdown on their fourth straight possession as Lewerke hit White again for a 10-yard touchdown as the lead ballooned to 28–3. WSU fumbled the ball on the ensuing possession and MSU capitalized as Lewerke moved MSU to the one yard line. However, Lewerke was forced to leave the game after being hit in the head on a rush. Senior quarterback Damian Terry replaced Lewerke and bowled his way in from six yards out to put the game out of reach at 35–3. WSU scored their first touchdown on their next possession, however, to draw within 25 at 35–10. Terry, still in the game for Lewerke was intercepted on the ensuing possession and WSU scored again narrowing the lead to 35–17 with 8:25 left in the game. Following a failed onside kick by the Cougars, Lewerke returned to the game to hand the ball off to LJ Scott on four straight downs and Scott rushed for 46 yards, scoring from 28 yards out to push the lead to 42–17. A Spartan interception on the next WSU possession ensured the game would end with an MSU victory. Terry returned to the game on the final MSU possession, but the Spartans were forced to punt. The Cougars had one last gasp, but ran out of time as the Spartans cruised to the 42–17 victory.
