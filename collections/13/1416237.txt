Several animatronic characters were also createdâ€¦ a puppeteered goose (Galaga) and  an animatronic head for the  giant Cernos. All of the giants in the film are played by regular-sized actors and actresses composited into the film so that they appear to be much larger. Their movements were also slowed down.
