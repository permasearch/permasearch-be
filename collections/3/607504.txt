On March 21, 2016, plans for the farewell tour (minus Valentine) were officially announced. The tour consisted of 18 dates kicking off on August 2 and ending on August 30. Kaya Stewart and Best Coast were the opening acts. A band statement said: "After a 38-year run, we are gearing up for one last blast of a summer tour".[21]  The farewell tour is meant to be the Go-Go's final extended tour, although the band has not actually broken up and still intends to perform on an occasional basis.
