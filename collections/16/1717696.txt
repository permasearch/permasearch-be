On June 30, 2015, Patricia Marie Connella Gunter, an Independent,[7] resigned as the District D justice of the peace for Grant Parish amid the United States Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which requires states to offer same-sex marriages and to recognize such unions approved in other states.[8] Gunter is married to the Reverend Brian Keith Gunter, a member of the Republican Party[9] and the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Pollock. Gunter said that she cannot "uphold the oath that I swore, which states that I will uphold the laws of this state and of the country. Same-sex marriage is now the law of the land and eventually, be it a month or a year when the legalities are sorted out, gay marriages will be conducted, and those who refuse would be subjected to ethics complaints and targets for litigation. We just decided that it was best for me to get out of the line of fire when it comes, and it is coming."[8] Gunter had been JP for only four months since her victory in a special election in February 2015.[10]
