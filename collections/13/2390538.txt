1998 meant minor trim and badge updates as GM readied the end of the GMT-400 platform. There was some overlap in 1999â€“2002 model years. In response to continued fleet sales, the GMT400 trucks were produced as the Sierra Classic/Silverado Classic until the GMT400 ended production at the end of the 2002 model year. A Brazilian version of the GMT400 was produced in Brazil powered with a Chevrolet inline six, a 4.2-liter I6 MWM Sprint Turbodiesel and a 4.0L I4 NA Maxion Diesel.
