In August 2010, it was rumoured that Coronation Street producer Phil Collinson was considering axing a number of the younger cast including Ryan, Chesney Battersby-Brown (Sam Aston) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) because he feared that the show was becoming more like Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks.[6][7] A Coronation Street spokeswoman confirmed Thompson's contract was not being renewed, but she added he might be paid episode-by-episode if needed.[7] On screen Ryan chose to attend a Scottish university and he departed in October.[7] The character's departure was confirmed but the producers denied that they had axed Ryan. An ITV spokesperson said: "Ryan hasn't been axed from the show and is still very much a part of Michelle Connor's life. There are plans to see him in future episodes when he returns from university for holidays.[8] In October 2010, Thompson said of his departure: "It wasn’t my choice to leave Coronation Street," he said. "But a new producer came in and wanted to shake things up. I am one of the characters that sadly wasn't part of the plan. Ryan is being sent off to university and can come back, but I don’t know if that will happen for the foreseeable future. I am sad, because it has been the biggest part of my life for the past four years. It has given me the freedom to work on my music, though. Writing music is something I have always done, but I've never been able to focus on it before because I had to do Coronation Street. It's nice to be able to do something completely different to acting.[9] Kym Marsh revealed that she was upset over Thompson's departure as they were both very close.[10]
