Initial treatment of an acute overdose involves resuscitation followed by gastric decontamination by administering activated charcoal, which adsorbs the aspirin in the gastrointestinal tract. Stomach pumping is no longer routinely used in the treatment of poisonings but is sometimes considered if the patient has ingested a potentially lethal amount less than one hour before presentation.[15] Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is not recommended.[10] Repeated doses of charcoal have been proposed to be beneficial in cases of aspirin overdosing,[16] although one study found that they might not be of significant value.[17] Regardless, most clinical toxicologists will administer additional charcoal if serum salicylate levels are increasing.
