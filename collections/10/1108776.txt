Hello, I hope someone may be able to provide me Polish language assistance.  In the Bagpipes article, it is described that some European surnames such as Piper (English), Gaitero (Spanish), Gajdar (Czech), DudÃ¡s (Hungarian), Tsambounieris (Greek), Gaidarski (Bulgarian), etc. may signify that an ancestor played the bagpipes.  I've just learned that a Polish and Ukrainian name for bagpipes is koza.  Thus, I wonder whether Kozar, Kozak, or some other Polish surnames may have a similar meaning.  Is there an equivalent surname in Polish that is the equivalent to the English "Piper" in that it originally meant "bagpiper" (or "player of the koza")?  Thank you,  Badagnani 08:09, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
