A 65th Anniversary Edition was released in a variation of the white box in 2000.[134] In 2001, the European Edition is reissued, correcting the mistake of the 1999 printing, and correctly listing Bern as the capital of Switzerland.[128] In 2005, a 70th Anniversary Edition was released in a silver-metallic tin with a plastic slip case.[135] Also starting in 2005, various "Here & Now" editions were released in multiple countries. The first release of this edition was for the UK market, and its success led to the selection of properties for a U.S. edition by online vote. The most popular properties were released on the U.S. "Here & Now" edition board in 2006. This, in turn, led to a worldwide "Here & Now" edition (released in 2008), along with other national editions (including a second UK "Here and Now" edition) with properties selected by online vote.[136][137][138] The main principle of the "Here & Now" editions was "What if Monopoly had been invented today?"[139]
