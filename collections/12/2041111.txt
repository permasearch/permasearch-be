The USC Department of Public Safety (DPS) is one of the largest campus public safety departments in the United States, employing 306 full-time personnel and 30 part-time student workers. DPSâ€™s patrol and response area includes a 2.5 mile radius around USC's main campus.[63] The Department of Public Safety headquarters is located on the University Park campus, and there is a substation on the Health Sciences campus. The department operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. All armed USC Public Safety Officers (approximately 120) are required to be police academy graduates so that they can be appointed reserve police officers with sworn peace officer authority anywhere in the state while on duty under California Penal Code 830.75.[64]
