In the United States, Article I of the Constitution gives the Congress the power to declare war (in the War Powers Clause), while Article II of the Constitution establishes the President as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the War Powers Resolution of 1973.
