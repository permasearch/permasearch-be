The state was named after the Delaware River, which in turn derived its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577â€“1618) who was the ruling governor of the Colony of Virginia at the time Europeans first explored the river. The Delaware Indians, a name used by Europeans for Lenape people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.
