Many of Pauling's critics, including scientists who appreciated the contributions that he had made in chemistry, disagreed with his political positions and saw him as a naÃ¯ve spokesman for Soviet communism. In 1960 he was ordered to appear before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee,[129] which termed him "the number one scientific name in virtually every major activity of the Communist peace offensive in this country."[130] A headline in Life magazine characterized his 1962 Nobel Prize as "A Weird Insult from Norway".[131]
