Planetary formation can also be triggered by gravitational instability within the disk itself, which leads to its fragmentation into clumps. Some of them, if they are dense enough, will collapse,[47] which can lead to rapid formation of gas giant planets and even brown dwarfs on the timescale of 1,000 years.[53] If these clumps migrate inward as the collapse proceeds tidal forces from the star can result in a significant mass loss leaving behind a smaller body.[54] However it is only possible in massive disks—more massive than 0.3 M☉. In comparison, typical disk masses are 0.01–0.03 M☉. Because the massive disks are rare, this mechanism of the planet formation is thought to be infrequent.[1][18] On the other hand, this mechanism may play a major role in the formation of brown dwarfs.[55]
