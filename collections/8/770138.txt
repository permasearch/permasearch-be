There are unsaid, known rules that govern many interactions, but with technology and social media being relatively recent developments, the etiquette can sometimes be difficult to know, learn, or follow. One of the main issues of interactions over technology is that without body language, facial expressions, or tone of voice, it can be easy to misunderstand or misinterpret parts of conversations. Etiquette in personal messaging specifically is important because it has many of the same qualities of a conversation, but lacks the face-to-face interaction that allows for the detection of sarcasm, uncomfortableness, etc. Etiquette therefore often requires exaggeration in order to make things clear, and not necessarily saying the same things that one may in a face-to-face interaction that could be construed without body language, facial expressions, or tone of voice.
