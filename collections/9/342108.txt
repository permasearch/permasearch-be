British surveyor John Gerard de Brahm, who mapped the coast of Florida in 1773, called the area "River Glades". Both Marjory Stoneman Douglas and linguist Wallace McMullen suggest that cartographers substituted "Ever" for "River".[clarification needed][3][4] The name "Everglades" first appeared on a map in 1823, although it was also spelled as "Ever Glades" as late as 1851.[5] The Seminole call it Pahokee, meaning "Grassy Water."[4] The region was labeled "Pa-hai-okee" on a U.S. military map from 1839, although it had earlier been called "Ever Glades" throughout the Second Seminole War.[3] The Everglades consist of multiple towns: South Bay, Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Sand Cut, Clewiston, Moore Haven, Lake Harbor, Davie, Parts of Miami, Weston, Parts of Fort Lauderdale, Immokalee, Naples, and Everglades City.
