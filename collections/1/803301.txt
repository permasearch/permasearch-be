The dimensions of the cross were formally established only in 1889: "The coat of arms of the federation is, within a red field, an upright white cross, whose [four] arms of equal length are one and a sixth times as long as they are wide."[3] The size of the cross in relation to the field is not formally established except on the naval ensign, for which the ratio of the size of the cross to the height is 5:8, and to the length is 5:12.[4] A ratio of 2:3 or 7:10 to the span of the flag is usual.[citation needed]
