Before the introduction of vaccination in the US in the 1960s there were more than 500,000 cases each year resulting in about 400 deaths. In developed countries children were mainly infected between the ages of three and five years old, but in developing countries half the children were infected before the age of two.[138] In the US and the UK, there were regular annual or biannual epidemics of the disease, which depended on the number of children born each year.[139] The current epidemic strain evolved in the first part of the 20th century – probably between 1908 and 1943.[140]
