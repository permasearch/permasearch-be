Because the last ice age removed the top sediment layer of the soil,[4] the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials,[8] as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores.[5] Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant.[8] Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.[8]
