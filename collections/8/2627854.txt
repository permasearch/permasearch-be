As explained in The Silmarillion, the First Age ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth by the combined armies of Valinor and Beleriand.[1] It covered a long period of Valian Years,[2] followed by approximately 590 Years of the Sun. Depending on the choice of conversion factors (among many that Tolkien used at different times), this translates to a period anywhere from 4,902 to 65,390 sun years. The greater number is supported by the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings and later writings, the lesser by earlier writings. The First Age was also known as the Elder Days, although this term was (starting with the Fourth Age) also applied to the first three Ages combined.
