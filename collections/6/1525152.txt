In Round 3, the two remaining contestants are asked six questions alternately, three to each contestant, and the leader at the end of Round 2 decides who will start. After hearing a question, the contestant in control may either answer or pass to the opponent. One counter is awarded for each correct answer, while a miss awards it to the opponent. Each counter is used as soon as it is earned. If the contestants are tied going into this round, the one who had a higher score at the beginning of Round 2 decides who will start.
