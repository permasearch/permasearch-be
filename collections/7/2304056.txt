Later, in the middle of nowhere, a girl is stuck on the side of the road because her car has broken down. A big red Peterbilt truck with a trailer attached drives past her, only to stop and back up after she makes a nasty comment. She explains what's happened and asks for a ride. As the truck door opens, it is revealed that the driver has a badly burnt right arm. The girl climbs in and a familiar voice says "You'll catch your death out there," revealing that the driver is Rusty Nail, who survived the explosion. He drives away with the girl.
