Once the machine was completed, the filming, using a single Steadicam, took two days to complete on February 11 and 12, with an estimated 60 takes for the machine to properly function. The first day of filming included 47 takes, none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming.[8] Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process, at the start of the song's chorus, where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine. Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take, a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran.[7] There were no significant injuries during filming; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end,[13] while the Steadicam operator nearly got hit with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video.  His reaction may be seen in the released version of the video.[17]
