The Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian state, Hawaii (HawaiÊ»i in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer James Cook and his crew members. They wrote it as "Owhyhee" or "Owhyee". Explorers Mortimer (1791) and Otto von Kotzebue (1821) used that spelling.[9]
