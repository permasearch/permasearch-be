Even in decline, Mycenae and Tyrins were disturbing to the Argives, who in their political propaganda wanted to monopolize the glory of legendary (and mythical) ancestors. In 468 BCE Argos completely destroyed both Mycenae and Tiryns[citation needed], and transferred - according to Pausanias - the residents to Argos, to increase the population of the city. However, Strabo says[10] that many Tirynthians moved to found the city of Halieis, modern Porto Heli.[11]
