An adjustment disorder (AD)—sometimes called exogenous, reactive, or situational depression[1]—occurs when an individual is unable to adjust to or cope with a particular stress or a major life event. Since people with this disorder normally have symptoms that depressed people do, such as general loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness and crying, this disorder is sometimes known as situational depression. Unlike major depression, the disorder is caused by an outside stressor and generally resolves once the individual is able to adapt to the situation.[citation needed] One hypothesis about AD is that it may represent a sub-threshold clinical syndrome.[2]
