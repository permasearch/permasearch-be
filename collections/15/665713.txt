Rolling Stone magazine described the song as "Lennon's lavish daydream"[37] and music critic Richie Unterberger said "'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds' was one of the best songs on the Beatles' famous Sgt. Pepper album, and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole. There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world, in both the sonic textures and words."[38] In a review for the BBC, Chris Jones described the track as "nursery rhyme surrealism" that contributed to Sgt. Pepper's "revolutionaryÂ ... sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms."[39] Hilary Saunders of Paste called the song "a perfectly indulgent introduction to psych-rock".[40]
