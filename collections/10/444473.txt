During World War II, a full metal jacket bullet version of the .22 LR was developed for the silenced High Standard HDM pistol.[24] The US Army Air Corps procured the Savage Model 24 .22 LR/.410 combination gun as an air crew survival weapon primarily to forage for game for food. The .22 LR full metal jacket bullet ammunition was issued with these firearms for military use to comply with treaty restrictions on expanding bullets.
