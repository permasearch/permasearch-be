Almost a century later, in the wake of the San Gabriel Valley's burgeoning population of Asian Americans, they have become a dominant cultural force.[26] Several business districts were developed to serve their needs creating a collection of Southern California Chinatowns loosely connected along the Valley Boulevard Corridor. This trend began in the city of Monterey Park during the late 1970s when many well-to-do Taiwanese professionals, began settling in the area. Initially, many Chinese restaurateurs and business owners at the time used primarily Traditional Chinese script and not English names on their business signs. This changed in 1986, when the city council of Monterey Park enacted an ordinance requiring the all businesses to translate their business signs and describe the nature of their businesses in English, deemed a matter of public safety.
