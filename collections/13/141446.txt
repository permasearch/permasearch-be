In 1993, after having split from Maurice Starr, the group shortened their name to the initialism NKOTB. In January 1994, their fourth studio album, Face the Music, was released. Their first studio album in close to four years, Face the Music was a musical departure from the group's previous efforts. Nearly all the songs were written and/or co-produced by the group. In spite of some positive critical reception, the album failed to live up to commercial expectation.[24] The album's final single to chart was "Dirty Dawg" (which featured a rap cameo by Nice & Smooth & Live Instrumentals & Background Vocals by Larry Thomas), peaking at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100.[11][25] The follow-up single, "Never Let You Go", failed to chart in the U.S., but did reach No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 18 in the Canadian charts.
