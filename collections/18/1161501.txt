The 2015 season showed the Yellow Jackets a 3-9 record, after numerous injuries throughout the entire year. Their only notable win was a 22-16 upset over #9 Florida State on Techâ€™s Homecoming Night. As time expired, the Yellow Jackets blocked an attempted field goal by Florida State Kicker Roberto Aguayo, which was picked up by Lance Austin, who returned it for the game-winning touchdown. This year marked the first year since 1996 that Georgia Tech did not make a bowl appearance.
