Celtic reached the European Cup final again in 1970. Celtic knocked out Basel in the first round, then defeated Portuguese side Benfica 3–0 at Parkhead in the first leg of the second round. Celtic's performance was impressive,[39] and they were unfortunate not to score more.[39] Benfica rallied in the return match and put Celtic under intense pressure from the start. John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2–0 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick in the final minute to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully called, and Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals.[39][40][41] Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline based on the number of corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time.[39] Celtic went on to face Italian champions Fiorentina in the quarter-finals, winning 3–1 on aggregate.[39][40]
