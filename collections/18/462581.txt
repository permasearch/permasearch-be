A hall, wall, or walk of fame is a list of individuals, achievements, or animals, usually chosen by a group of electors, to mark their fame in their field. In some cases, these halls of fame consist of actual halls or museums which enshrine the honorees with sculptures, plaques, and displays of memorabilia and general information regarding the inducted recipients. Sometimes, the honorees' plaques may instead be posted on a wall (hence a "wall of fame") or inscribed on a sidewalk (as in a "walk of fame" or an "avenue of fame"). In other cases, the hall of fame is more figurative and simply consists of a list of names of noteworthy people or achievements. The lists are maintained by an organization or community, and may be national, state, local, or private.
