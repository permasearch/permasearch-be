C O  P  h e a t i n g     {\displaystyle COP_{heating}}   applies to heat pumps and     C O  P  c o o l i n g     {\displaystyle COP_{cooling}}   applies to air conditioners or refrigerators. For heat engines, see Efficiency. Values for actual systems will always be less than these theoretical maximums. In Europe, the standard tests for ground source heat pump units use 35 °C (95 °F) for       T  h o t      {\displaystyle {T_{hot}}}   and 0 °C (32 °F) for       T  c o l d      {\displaystyle {T_{cold}}}  . According to the above formula, the maximum achievable COP would be 7.8. Test results of the best systems are around 4.5. When measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems, seasonal COP's are around 3.5 or less. This indicates room for improvement.[4]
