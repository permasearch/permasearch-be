Manik and Nandini's petty fights and constant bickeringâ€™s bring them closer and they become attracted to each other. Manik realises that no one affects him the way Nandini does, which is why he is always drawn to her. Initially he fights the attraction but eventually gives in. Nandini begins to understand Manik a little more after he begins to open up to her and she realises that he is not the "Monster Manik" she deemed him to be and becomes aware of her growing attraction towards him, previously misunderstanding the racing of her heart around Manik to be hatred for him.
