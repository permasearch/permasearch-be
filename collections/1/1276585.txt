In May 2007, Central Christian College organized an Alumni Association. The official purpose is to be "an advisory council to the CCCB President that provides a voice for graduates and former students in the ongoing development & growth of Central Christian College of the Bible. The Alumni Association also serves as a fellowship association that connects graduates and former students together to develop a strong sense of fellowship and pride in the College. One of the main projects that the Alumni Association has is the annual "Alumni Homecoming."[8]
