The static friction force (     F   s f      {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {sf} }}  ) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the coefficient of static friction (     Î¼   s f      {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {sf} }}  ) multiplied by the normal force (     F  N     {\displaystyle F_{N}}  ). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:
