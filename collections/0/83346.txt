The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave 'a sickle was made out of the strongest metal' to her youngest son 'Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and "Flesh of The Gods" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.
