When practicing before the Internal Revenue Service, enrolled agents may not use the term "certified" in describing their professional designation. An enrolled agent admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that an employer/employee relationship exists between the enrolled agent and the Internal Revenue Service.
