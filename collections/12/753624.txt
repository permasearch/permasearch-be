Husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and son of Laërtes and Anticlea, Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual brilliance, guile, and versatility (polytropos), and is hence known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning (mētis, or "cunning intelligence"). He is most famous for his nostos or “homecoming”, which took him ten eventful years after the decade-long Trojan War.
