The toxic effects of salicylates have been described since at least 1877.[5] In 2004 more than 20,000 cases with 43 deaths were reported in the United States.[1] About 1% of those with an acute overdose die while chronic overdoses may have worse outcomes.[3] Older people are at higher risks of toxicity for any given dose.[5]
