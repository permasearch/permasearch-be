Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club thought that the episode was quirky, especially in the scenes involving Veronica's babysitting. On the episode's tone, he added, "And this is fine. This is great, even. Combined with things like Veronica's vision of Lilly in the season premiere, it makes me think that Veronica Mars is moving in a much more metaphorical direction."[7] Television Without Pity gave the episode a "B".[8]
