In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point[1] is a point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) of orthogonal function components defining the surface become zero (a stationary point) but are not a local extremum on both axes.[2] The saddle point will always occur at a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis.
