A wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is a taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat,[115] while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman out of his ground and not attempting a run.[116]
