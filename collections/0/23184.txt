The idea for Five Nights at Freddy's stems from negative reception towards Scott Cawthon's previous game, the family friendly Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., as players commented that the main character (a young beaver) looked like "a scary animatronic animal", with reviewer Jim Sterling calling the game unintentionally "terrifying".[2][3] Although initially discouraged by the comments, Cawthon, who had previously mainly developed Christian-oriented games, eventually used it to inspire himself to make something intentionally scarier.[2]
