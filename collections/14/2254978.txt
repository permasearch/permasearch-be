The X activation cycle is best studies in mouse, but there are multiple studies in humans. As most of the evidence is coming from mouse, the above scheme represents the events in mice. The completion of the meiosis is simplified here for clarity. Steps 1-4 can be studied in in vitro fertilized embryos, and in differentiating stem cells; X-reactivation happens in the developing embryo, and subsequent (6-7) steps inside the female body, therefore much harder to study.
