Interstate 84 starts in Pennsylvania at Interstate 81 in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, a suburb east of Scranton. After two miles (3Â km), I-84 interchanges with Interstate 380, with I-380 going southeast through the Poconos and I-84 continuing almost due east into Wayne and Pike counties. The Pennsylvania section is the only segment of I-84 that uses mile-based exit numbers; it began replacing sequential numbers in 2001.
