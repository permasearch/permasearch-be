On May 16, 2013, Screen International reported that in conjunction with Nancy Buirski at Augusta Films, Colin Firth's Raindog Films and Silver Reel are developing a feature film on Richard Loving and Mildred Loving, inspired by Buirski's documentary.[138][139][140][141] Firth had initially toyed with the idea of writing the Loving, however, at Martin Scorsese's recommendation, who was eager to see The Loving Story (2011) turned into a feature, both Firth and Buirski hired Nichols.[4][142][143] Nichols described Scorsese as "a shepherd of this project and wanted to see it made into a narrative film", and later laid out his approach in terms of trying to stay with the Lovings as much as possible through the telling of the story, something of which Scorsese was very supportive of.[144] On May 8, 2015, Deadline.com reported that Jeff Nichols was boarding the project as director and will write the script,[145] with Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga starring as Richard and Mildred Loving, respectively, the interracial couple at the center of the famous 1967 civil rights case Loving v. Virginia.[146] On May 8, 2015, it was announced that Big Beach and Raindog films are to produce Nichols' piece,[146] with producers including Sarah Green, Colin Firth, Ged Doherty, Nancy Buirski, Marc Turtletaub, and Peter Saraf.[147][148] Prior to the production of Loving, director Nichols spoke briefly of his influence for the film, such as Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011), to which Nichols stated, "I was struck by the simplicity of The Loving Story, and I hope to make this a painfully beautiful film."[149][150][151]
