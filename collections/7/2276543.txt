Jones returned to Indiana in 1963.[3] While he had always spoken of the social gospel's virtues, Jones did not reveal that his gospel was actually communism until the late 1960s.[3] By then, he was openly revealing in Temple sermons his "apostolic Socialism" concept.[3][20] The concept often loosely mixed tenets of socialism.[note 1] During this period, Jones preached to new members that the Holy Spirit was within them, but that Jones's healing power demonstrated that he was a special manifestation of "Christ the Revolution."[3] He also preached that the United States was the Antichrist and capitalism "the Antichrist system."[3]
