In the absence of a Welsh tick-box, the only other plausible tick-boxes available were 'white-British,' 'Irish', or 'other'.[57] The Scottish parliament insisted that a Scottish ethnicity tick-box be included in the census in Scotland, and with this inclusion as many as 88.11% claimed Scottish ethnicity.[59] Critics argued that a higher proportion of respondents would have described themselves as of Welsh ethnicity had a Welsh tick-box been made available. Additional criticism was levelled at the timing of the census, which was taken in the middle of the Foot and Mouth crisis of 2001, a fact organizers said did not affect the results.[56] However, the Foot and Mouth crisis did delay the UK General Elections, the first time since the Second World War any event postponed an election.
