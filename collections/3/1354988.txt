The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, matching population growth.[102] The result was no change in income levels.

Extensive irrigation systems were built, providing an impetus for growing cash crops for export and for raw materials for Indian industry, especially jute, cotton, sugarcane, coffee, and tea.[103]
