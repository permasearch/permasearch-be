Red was a Boatswain Mate in the Navy during World War II and Korea. Since he served on a destroyer but saw land combat in Guadalcanal (August 1942 – February 1943) and Korea (1950–1953) it would appear that he served as a Seabee, an assault boat pilot, or in EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal). He might have also served on board a submarine, as evidenced in Season 8, Episode 6 "Long Away". He is wearing Submarine Warfare (Dolphins) on his garrison cap during the Veterans reunion. On one occasion, when Red and Kitty are making out in their car, a policeman knocks on the window, not realizing it is a married couple inside. Red sharply dispatches him and Kitty says, "How sweet, you let him off with a warning".
