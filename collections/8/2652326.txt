The term "progressive rock" is synonymous with "art rock", "classical rock" and "symphonic rock".[10] Historically, "art rock" has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music.[11] The first is progressive rock as it is generally understood, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist, avant-garde approach.[11][nb 1] Similarities between the two terms are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. However, art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences.[13] "Prog" was devised in the 1990s[14] as a shorthand term, but later became a transferable adjective, also suggesting a wider palette than that drawn on by the most popular 1970s bands.[15]
