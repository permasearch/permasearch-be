Merlin thwarts Morgause's plan for Arthur to eventually kill Uther (having opened a brief gateway, in order to call Ygraine to her son- and reveal Uther's part in his mother's passing, and most importantly: the fact that Arthur was born with the aid of magic) - Arthur, enraged at decades of destruction and hatred due to Uther and his lies, now desires to kill Uther in vengeance for his mother- just as Morgause expected. But Merlin lies to Arthur and says the shade has to have just been an illusion created by Morgause, purely for the sake of creating discord between father and son (despite the fact that he knows, from both Gaius and the late Nimueh that what Ygraine's spirit is saying, in fact, true). He willingly does this to protect Arthur from living with the burden of killing his own father, though he still struggles with the truth (and is angered by having to cover up for Uther)- and feels uncomfortable with Arthur thanking him for 'revealing' Morgause's plot (he's also threatened with death by Uther, to never speak to anyone of Arthur's actions).
