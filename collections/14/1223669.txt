It is alleged[by whom?] that Planning Commission (PC) which is neither a constitutional nor a statutory body has usurped the role of Finance Commission (FC). PC has restricted FC's role to mere recommend grants to states on revenue account only under article 275 of Indian constitution. However, after the formation of NITI Aayog (National Institute of Transforming India), which comes to replace the Planning Commission seeks to empower FC with the originally envisaged task of distribution of revenue to the states.[citation needed]
