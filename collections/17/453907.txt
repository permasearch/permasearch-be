Although easy to ride slowly because of their high center of mass and the inverted pendulum effect,[31][32] the penny-farthing is prone to accidents. To stop, the rider presses back on the pedals while applying a spoon-shaped brake pressing the tire. The center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a pothole or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars.[33] On long downhills, some riders hooked their feet over the handlebars. This made for quick descents but left no chance of stopping.[3] A new type of handlebar was introduced, called Whatton bars, that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and also be able to leap forward feet-first off the machine.[13]
