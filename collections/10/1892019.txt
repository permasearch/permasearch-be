On October 5, 2015, a remake starring Ellen Page and Diego Luna was announced,[15][16] following the casting of Nina Dobrev, James Norton and Kiersey Clemons. Kiefer Sutherland will return for the remake. Sutherland later disclosed that he was reprising his role from the original film, revealing that the new film would actually be a sequel rather than a remake. However, the scene identifying Sutherland as playing his character from the first film was cut from the theatrical version of the sequel, only reinstated in the film's extended edition.[17] Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev, it was released on September 29, 2017.[18]
