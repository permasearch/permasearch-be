Advertising for the Big King was spearheaded by a national television program from APL that debuted on September 1, 1997.[52] The television ads were part of a US$30 million program to promote the sandwich. It was introduced with a promotional price of 99Â¢ for the first two weeks of sales, which helped drive sales for the product.[8][53] The advertisements featured the company's new "Get Your Burger's Worth" tagline and they attacked the Big Mac with the claim "Get ready for a new taste that beats the Big Mac." Additional ads continued the attacks, stating "just like a Big Mac, except it's got 75% more beef. And it's flame-broiled."[54]
