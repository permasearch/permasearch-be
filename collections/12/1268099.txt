Despite being severely ill and in great pain, Dunn continued working nearly up to the day of his death, living up to his own description of himself as "a both-feet jumper."[5] He was buried on September 10, 1973, in Lauderdale Memorial Park Cemetery, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, near his parents' retirement home in Lauderhill. In July 2007, a first cousin had his remains exhumed and driven to Oklahoma, re-interred near his parents' graves in Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery, Norman, Oklahoma.[12]
