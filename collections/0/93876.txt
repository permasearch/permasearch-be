The Noahic covenant[Gen 9:8–17] applies to all of humanity and to all other living creatures.[8] In this covenant, God promises never again to destroy all life on Earth by flood[9:11] and creates the rainbow as the sign of this "everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth".[9:12–17]
