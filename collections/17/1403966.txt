Taking away 40 blocks in the center of St. Louis was bitterly fought by some sourcesâ€”particularly the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.[5] On September 10, 1935, the voters of St. Louis approved a $7.5 million bond issue to buy the property. Local architect Louis Le Beaume provided a preliminary design proposal for the site that included multiple museums, fountains, and obelisks.[6]
