The US News listings have gained such influence that some Universities have made it a specific goal to reach a particular level in the US News rankings.[51] Belmont University president Bob Fisher stated in 2010, "Rising to the Top 5 in U.S. News represents a key element of Belmontâ€™s Vision 2015 plan."[52] Clemson University made it a public goal to rise to the Top 20 in the US News rankings, and made specific changes, including reducing class size and altering the presentation of teacher salaries, so as to perform better in the statistical analysis by US News.[53] At least one university, Arizona State, has actually tied the university president's pay to an increase in the school's placement in the US News rankings.[54]
