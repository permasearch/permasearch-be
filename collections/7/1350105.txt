After the announcement of the new batch of A ranked trainees, A rankers individually appeal to the other trainees to be selected as center for "It's Me (Pick Me)". The trainees have to vote for their center pick.[17] They then start rehearsing for the stage: Brand New Music's Lee Dae-hwi of group A is voted to be the center. After their live performance, BoA announced the departure of 3 trainees from the show and that the 37 contestants who would receive the lowest ranks would be eliminated in the first elimination.
