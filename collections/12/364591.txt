"Right Back Where We Started From" was recorded at Central Sound Studio a small demo studio on Denmark Street in Camden: personnel on the session included two former members of the Electric Light Orchestra: Mike de Albuquerque (bass guitar) and violinist Wilfred Gibson who did the strings arrangement.[5] In the WFMU interview, Edwards identified other players on the session as drummer Pete Kircher and keyboardist Dave Rowberry: also Tubbs played guitar and Edwards provided percussion. Nightingale would advise Rolling Stone that she had disliked Tubbs's utilization of both a crashing keyboard arrangement and heavy hand claps: she was also discomfited by being required to sing in a higher key than she was accustomed to.
