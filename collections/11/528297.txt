The foot hills in Bhutan and India known as Terai and the Duars (A Sanskrit word meaning "passes" or "gates"), which encompass 15–30 kilometres (9.3–18.6 mi) stretch of the foot hills and which are very fertile. Each Duar (with elevation varying from 100 metres (330 ft) to near sea level as they join the Brahmaputra river) is named after a stream or hemmed between two streams. Some part of the Duars in Bhutan was under British control. The fertile lands have been developed into tea estates and paddy fields.[12]
