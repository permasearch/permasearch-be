In 1889 a whaling supply and rescue station was built. It is the oldest wood-frame building in UtqiaÄ¡vik and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The rescue station was converted for use in 1896 as the retail Cape Smythe Whaling and Trading Station. In the late 20th century, the building was used as Brower's Cafe.
