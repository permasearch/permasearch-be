The production of hydrogen from oil is achieved by partial oxidation. For this, a carefully controlled fuel-air mix is partially combusted, which results in an H2-rich gas. Like the previous process, the formation of hydrogen from oil is done with a water-gas shift reaction.[5] The energy added to the process is achieved by the combustion of fuels, which also causes a negative impact to the environment.
