The original factory was located near Stettiner Bahnhof. In 1887 the Company acquired land in the Berlin-Gesundbrunnen area on which the Weddingsche Maschinenfabrik (founded by Wilhelm Wedding) was previously located[citation needed]. In the same year, in addition to a restructuring and expansion of the production range, the AEG name was adopted.[chron 4]
