Frees was born Solomon Hersh Frees in Chicago, Illinois, on June 22, 1920; he grew up in the Albany Park neighborhood and attended Von Steuben Junior High School[3] in Peoria.[4] He had an unusually wide four-octave voice range that would enable him to voice everything from the thundering basso profondo of the unseen "Ghost Host" in the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland in California[1] and at Walt Disney World in Florida to the voice of the farmer who helps the Little Green Sprout (voiced by Ike Eisenmann) in the Green Giant vegetable commercials.
