Further, one of the least remarked-on problems facing the world's poor living on two dollars a day is that they do not literally get that amount each day.  In other words, economic poverty is not just a matter of low incomes, but also of irregular and uncertain incomes.  To put food on the table every day and meet other basic consumption needs, poor households have to save and borrow constantly.[45]  One research team presented results of year-long financial diaries collected about twice a month from hundreds of rural and urban households in India, Bangladesh, and South Africa.  They consistently found the poor use credit and savings to smooth consumption, to deal with emergencies like health problems and to accumulate the larger sums they need to seize opportunities—occasionally business opportunities—and pay for big-ticket expenses like education, weddings and funerals.[46] Over the year, the average diary household used 8 to 10 different types of financial instruments; most types were used multiple times.  The notion that microcredit brings loans to people who previously had no access to them is widespread but mistaken, as is the notion that the strong majority of microloans are used for business purposes.[47]
