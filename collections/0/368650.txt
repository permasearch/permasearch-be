The Southern states had blocked westward rail expansion before 1860, but after secession the Pacific Railway Acts were passed in 1862,[24] allowing the first transcontinental railroad to be completed in 1869, making possible a six-day trip from New York to San Francisco. Other transcontinentals were built in the South (Southern Pacific, Santa Fe) and along the Canadaâ€“US border (Northern Pacific, Great Northern), accelerating the settlement of the West by offering inexpensive farms and ranches on credit, carrying pioneers and supplies westward, and cattle, wheat and minerals eastward. In 1860 railroads carried less than half as much freight as inland waterways, by 1890 railroads carried 5 times as much freight than waterways.
