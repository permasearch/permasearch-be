The original Hearts football strip was all white shirts and trousers with maroon trimmings, and a heart sewn onto the chest.[163] For one season they played in red, white and blue stripes.[163] These were the colours of a club called St. Andrew, who had taken their name and colours from the University of St Andrews, that Hearts had absorbed. Since then the predominant club colours have been maroon and white.[163] The strip typically has a maroon top and a white collar,[163] although the strip was predominantly white in the 2010–11 season.[164] The shorts are normally white, although maroon was used in the 2008–09 season.[163] The socks are normally maroon with some white detail.[163]
