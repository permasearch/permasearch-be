Shutter lag is the time between the shutter release being pressed and the exposure started. While this delay was insignificant on most film and some digital cameras, many digital cameras have significant delay, which can be a problem with fast-moving subjects as in sports and other action photography. Release lag of a bridge camera such as the 2010 Pentax X90 is a relatively short 1/50Â s,[8] or 21 milliseconds (ms). The Canon 50d dSLR is specified at 131 ms lag.[9]
