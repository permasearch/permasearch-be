The imaginary town of Two Mills is based on Jerry Spinelliâ€™s childhood town of Norristown, PA.[1] Spinelli has said that material from the story was inspired by his childhood experiences there,[2] and a number of geographical correspondences confirm this. Norristown, like Two Mills, is across the Schuylkill River from Bridgeport, and neighboring towns include Conshohocken, Jeffersonville and Worcester, all of which are mentioned in the novel. [3] The Elmwood Park Zoo is in Norristown, and Valley Forge, where Maniac wanders,[3] is nearby as well. There is also a street named Hector Street in Conshohocken.
