Root hair cells are outgrowths at a tip of the plant's roots. Root hair cells vary between 15 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length.[1] They are found only in the zone of maturation, and not the zone of elongation, possibly because any root hairs that arise are sheared off as the root elongates and moves through the soil.
