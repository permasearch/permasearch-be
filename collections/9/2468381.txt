The script of the Han Chinese characters has long been a unifying feature in East Asia as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to its East Asian neighbors.[39] Chinese characters became the unifying language of bureaucratic politics and religious expression in East Asia.[39] The Chinese script was passed on first to Korea, Vietnam in the 1st century, then to Japan, where it forms a major component of the Japanese writing system. In Korea, however, Sejong the Great invented the hangul alphabet, which has since been used as the main orthographic system for the Korean language.[40] In Japan, much of the Japanese language is written in hiragana, katakana in addition to Chinese characters.[38]
