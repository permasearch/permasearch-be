As well as being related to eye movements, the SC appears to have an important role to play in the circuitry underpinning distractibility. Heightened distractibility occurs in normal ageing [21] and is also a central feature in a number of medical conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [22]. Research has shown that lesions to the SC in a number of species can results in heightened distractibility[23][24] and, in humans, removing the inhibitory control on the SC from the pre-frontal cortex, therefore increasing activity in the area, also increases distractibility[25]. Research in an animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, also shows altered collicular-dependent behaviours[26] [27] and physiology [27]. Furthermore, amphetamine (a mainstay treatment for ADHD) also suppresses activity in the colliculus in healthy animals [28][29].
