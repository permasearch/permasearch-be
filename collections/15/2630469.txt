The production engines use the Duratec 35 V6 engine block. The fuel charging and delivery systems can attain high fuel pressures up to 2150 psi, necessary for efficient operation of the direct fuel injection system. The F-series EcoBoost 3.5L V6 uses two BorgWarner K03 turbochargers which can spin up to 170,000Â rpm and provide up to 15 psi of boost. The transverse EcoBoost 3.5L V6 uses two Garrett GT1549L turbochargers and provides up to 11 psi of boost. The turbos are set up in a twin-turbo configuration. The engine can consume up to 25% more air over the naturally aspirated counterpart. Through the use of direct injection, the engine needs only regular-grade gasoline to run. The EcoBoost V6 was first available as an engine option for 2010 Lincoln MKS, followed by 2010 Ford Flex, 2010 Ford Taurus SHO, and 2010 Lincoln MKT.[57]  The fuel-charging and -delivery systems were co-developed with Robert Bosch GmbH.[58]
