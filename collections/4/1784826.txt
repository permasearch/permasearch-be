Connecticut hot dog restaurants often serve Hummel Bros, Martin Rosol or Grote and Weigel dogs, which are family operations, with national brands being relatively less common. Hot dogs are typically served on New England rolls. There is otherwise no particular Connecticut style. It is customary for hot dogs to be served plain so the customer can put their own condiments on the hot dog. Options can range wildly from establishment to establishment, with Blackie's of Cheshire offering hot pepper relish, brown mustard or ketchup only[11] while the Windmilll of Stratford is known for dogs loaded with sauerkraut, onions, and pickly chili on soft buns.[12] Capitol Lunch of New Britain sells chili dogs made from Martin Rosol hotdogs, produced across the street from the restaurant,[13] with mustard, chopped onions, and a meat sauce[14] that has been praised by culinary and travel writers throughout the nation.[15][16] Other noted establishments include Rawley's of Fairfield and Super Duper Weenie.[17]
