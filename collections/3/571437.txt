When the black–red–gold tricolor was adopted by the Weimar Republic as its flag, it was attacked by conservatives, monarchists, and the far right, who referred to the colors with spiteful nicknames such as Schwarz–Rot–Gelb (black–red–yellow), Schwarz–Rot–Senf (black–red–mustard), or even Schwarz–Rot–Scheiße (black–red–shit).[14] When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the black–white–red colors of pre-1918 Imperial Germany were swiftly reintroduced, and their propaganda machine continued to discredit the Schwarz–Rot–Gold, using the same derogatory terms as previously used by the monarchists.[15]
