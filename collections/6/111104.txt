Polar bears appear to be less affected by infectious diseases and parasites than most terrestrial mammals.[126] Polar bears are especially susceptible to Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm they contract through cannibalism,[127] although infections are usually not fatal.[126] Only one case of a polar bear with rabies has been documented, even though polar bears frequently interact with Arctic foxes, which often carry rabies.[126] Bacterial leptospirosis and Morbillivirus have been recorded. Polar bears sometimes have problems with various skin diseases that may be caused by mites or other parasites.
