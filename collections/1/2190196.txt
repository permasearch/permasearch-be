In 1981, Palau voted for the world's first nuclear-free constitution. This constitution banned the use, storage and disposal of nuclear, toxic chemical, gas and biological weapons without first being approved by a ¾ majority in a referendum.[31] This ban delayed Palau's transition to independence, because while negotiating the Compact, the U.S. insisted on the option to operate nuclear propelled vessels and store nuclear weapons within the territory,[32] prompting campaigns for independence and denuclearisation.[33] After several referendums that failed to achieve a ¾ majority, the people of Palau finally approved the Compact in 1994.[34][35]
