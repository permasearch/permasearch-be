Alistair was mainly written by David Gaider—the lead writer of Origins—and is voiced by Steve Valentine.[6] Alistair is a relatively new Grey Warden,[7] who are a group devoted to fighting darkspawn. He's believed to be the secret son of King Maric and a serving girl, and was originally raised in Redcliffe Castle by Arl Eamon after his mother's death.[8] However, he was later given to the Chantry for training as a templar, a military order who are trained to kill "apostates" (mages outside of the Circle of Magi) and watch over the Circle of Magi. Alistair is described as having a "wry sense of humor", and makes many sarcastic remarks during the game.[7][9]
