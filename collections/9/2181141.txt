this page focuses too much on the historical revisionist take on the civil war as a war to free slaves. Many disagree. This was really a war about economics, slavery was just caught in the middle. Slave compromises and slave state issues were merely means to an end and that was seeking a balance between two growing views on federal power and economic control. The northern states wanted more centralization with more economic protectionism while the south favored decentralization of power and more free trade. This is the real version of history that has had to make room for the populist view no given on this page (which it should simply for the fact that it is taught in history classes nationwide rather than being factual itself. nevertheless the economic explination needs to be given more attention.
