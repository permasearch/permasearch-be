American Pharoah finished 2015 having set a single-season record for race earnings, winning $8,288,800. He broke the previous single season record of $7,563,535 set by Smarty Jones in 2004, and that record had included a $5 million bonus that is no longer awarded.[106] His lifetime career earnings were $8,650,300.[2] His Racing Post Rating (RPR) of 138 was the highest of any American horse since the Racing Post began the system in 1988, topping that of previous U.S. record-holders Ghostzapper and Cigar.  Only two horses worldwide had ever achieved higher ratings, Frankel at 143, and Dubai Millennium, with 139, both doing so as more mature four-year-olds.[107] He was rated the number one horse in the world in 2015 by the World's Best Racehorse Rankings.[108]
