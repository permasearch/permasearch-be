The FDA granted this health claim for soy: "25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease".[73] For reference, 100 grams of firm tofu coagulated with calcium sulfate contains 8.19 grams of soy protein.[74] In January 2006 an American Heart Association review (in the journal Circulation) of a decade-long study of soy protein benefits showed only a minimal decrease in cholesterol levels, but it compared favorably against animal protein sources.[75]
