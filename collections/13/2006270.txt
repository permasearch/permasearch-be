The Dollars trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when A Fistful of Dollars opened in January, followed by For a Few Dollars More in May, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on December 29, 1967.[78] All the films were commercially successful, particularly The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which eventually earned $8Â million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star.[78] All three films received bad reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect.[79] Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as "cheapjack,"[80] while Newsweek considered For a Few Dollars More as "excruciatingly dopey."[79] Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre."[81] Time magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger.[82] Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.[79]
