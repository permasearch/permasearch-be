Tulagi and two nearby small islands, Gavutu and Tanambogo, were assaulted by 3,000 U.S. Marines.[35] The 886 IJN personnel manning the naval and seaplane bases on the three islands fiercely resisted the Marine attacks.[36] With some difficulty, the Marines secured all three islands; Tulagi on 8 August, and Gavutu and Tanambogo by 9 August.[37] The Japanese defenders were killed almost to the last man, while the Marines suffered 122 killed.[38]
