Billie Joe Armstrong had at one point, prior to its release, suggested the album would make good material for an adapted feature film.[36] Shortly after the album was released, there was speculation that American Idiot might be made into a film. In a interview with VH1, Armstrong said, "We've definitely been talking about someone writing a script for it, and there's been a few different names that have been thrown at us. It sounds really exciting, but for right now it's just talk."[122] Armstrong later stated that filming would begin in 2006, stressing, "We want to see how it turns out first so that it doesn't suck."[123] On June 1, 2006, Armstrong announced in an interview with MTV that the movie was "definitely unfolding" and that "every single week there's more ideas about doing a film for American Idiot, and it's definitely going to happen".[124] In the summer of 2010, when asked by Virgin Radio if the film was "true, a lie, or a mystery", TrÃ© Cool responded by saying that it was "a true mystery".[125]
