On 25 August 2009, while promoting her solo album No Baggage in New York City on 101.9 RXP radio, O'Riordan announced the reunion of the Cranberries for a world tour. The tour began in North America in mid-November, followed by South America in mid-January 2010 and Europe in March 2010.[44] Also touring with the original members of The Cranberries was Denny DeMarchi, who played the keyboard for O'Riordan's solo albums.[45] The band played songs from O'Riordan's solo albums, many of the Cranberries' classics, as well as new songs. On 9 June 2010 The Cranberries performed at the Special Olympics opening ceremony at Thomond Park in Limerick; it was the first time the band had performed in their native city in over 15 years.[46]
