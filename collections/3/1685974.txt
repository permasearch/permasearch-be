Fourier series are used to solve boundary value problems in partial differential equations.[84] In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation.[85] A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points.[86] The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT is one of the key tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression.[87] The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.[88]
