In 1837 the London and Birmingham Railway conducted trials using a Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph to direct signalling[20] and in 1841 held a conference to propose a uniform national system of coloured signals to control trains,[23] but despite these advances elsewhere the Liverpool and Manchester Railway continued to be controlled by policemen and flags until its merger with the Grand Junction Railway in 1845.[24]
