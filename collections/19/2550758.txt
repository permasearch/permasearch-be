As Ultimate Big Chill, he is red-skinned with flame design on his wings, antennae and around his eyes, which causes his face to resemble a mask; his voice is more gravelly than normal and is deeper-toned. In this state, Ultimate Big Chill can create "ice flames", flames that turn into ice. They consume the heat of whatever they touch and freezes them much faster than normal. He was first used in "Hit Em Where They Live", to fight Vulkanus and his Pickaxe Alien army.
