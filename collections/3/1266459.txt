In the Years of the Trees where the Ents were thriving in 1495 Morgoth had re-established his realm in Middle-earth.[2]  With this the Entwives had moved across to the east where Anduin lay.[2] Treebeard's Entwife Fimbrethil was driven from her land and the two were separated forever. This may have been the dominant cause of the loss of the Entwives and the loss of the Entings.[2][7]
