Left Bank directors include Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, and Agnès Varda.[16] Roud described a distinctive "fondness for a kind of Bohemian life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the plastic arts, and a consequent interest in experimental filmmaking", as well as an identification with the political left.[16] The filmmakers tended to collaborate with one another.[18] Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Marguerite Duras are also associated with the group.[19] The nouveau roman movement in literature was also a strong element of the Left Bank style, with authors contributing to many of the films. Left Bank films include La Pointe Courte, Hiroshima mon amour, La jetée, Last Year at Marienbad, and Trans-Europ-Express.
