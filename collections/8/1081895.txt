At 9:30 pm on April 10, 2013, a landslide occurred at the mine.  It was the largest non-volcanic landslide in the history of North America.  Around 65–70 million cubic meters (2.3×10^9–2.5×10^9 cu ft) of dirt and rock thundered down the side of the pit.[12] Understanding that the mine's steep walls made it a high risk for landslides, an interferometric radar system had been installed to monitor the ground's stability. As a result of warnings produced by this system, mining operations were shut down the previous day in anticipation of the slide. There were no injuries.[13] The massive slide was expected to cut production of mined copper by 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons).[14] A second slide caused an evacuation of 100 workers on September 11, 2013.[15]
