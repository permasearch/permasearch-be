Majors' 1985 Volunteer squad (9–1–2, 5–1) was one of his most revered squads. The team lost only one game, regrouped after losing the services of Heisman trophy contending quarterback Tony Robinson for the season, and won their first conference title since 1969. The Big Orange earned a trip to the 1986 Sugar Bowl, where they defeated the heavily favored and 2nd-ranked Miami Hurricanes, coached by Jimmy Johnson, 35–7. The win kept Miami from winning a national title and earned the 1985 UT squad the nickname "Sugar Vols." Also during the Majors era, Tennessee began to be known as "Wide Receiver U" after several of UT's wide receivers went on to play in the NFL. Some of these players that started this reputation included, Tim McGee, Willie Gault, Eric Swanson, and Joey Clinkscales.
