In 2014, Grenier and Glatzer partnered with Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture to create SHFT Mobile Kitchen Classroom â€“ a teaching kitchen on wheels for high-school students in New York City. Through lessons on cooking, science, technology, and sustainability, it is designed to help teenagers understand how the food choices they make relate to broader issues of personal and environmental health.[18]
