Once Jax and SAMCRO return from Belfast, they begin looking for Tara. The Mayans help in the search because Salazar is a threat to their new heroin operation in Stockton Prison. They find two women dead in the road. One is Salazar's girlfriend and the other is a woman Salazar killed for her car. Jax is worried about Tara's safety and Bobby promises him they will bring her back safely. They discover that Salazar not only has Tara, but has also taken Hale hostage. When Salazar reveals that he will trade Tara for Jax, he is ready and willing. Jax proceeds to get into a fight with Salazar. Salazar runs, only to end up cornered in the hall, where Jax stabs him to death and makes it look like self-defense. Later, he goes with Tara to have an ultrasound to make sure the baby is healthy. Jax later meets with Stahl, who is still determined to see the deal through. In the finale, it is revealed that his deal with Stahl was a club decision, and that he would never rat on his family. When she inevitably reneges on her promise of secrecy, he acts the part knowing she will soon be dead and they will serve light time. In a letter to Gemma, Jax assures her that he is not his father and would never rat on the club. However, Tara reads a letter from Jax's father to his mistress Maureen Ashby, after the club is arrested, which strongly suggests that Gemma and Clay were responsible for John Teller's death.
