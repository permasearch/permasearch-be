Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases.[89] Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further strokes in those who have already had one.[116] Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful.[117][118] People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person's preferences.[89] Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long â€”the risk of recurrent stroke in a patient who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one patient was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.[119][120]
