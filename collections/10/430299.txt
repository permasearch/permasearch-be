The season three premiere opens with Brooke returning from her summer vacation in California. Afraid of having her heart broken again, Brooke only agrees to date Lucas non-exclusively; at the same time, she pretends to have spent her summer with a number of other guys, though it is later revealed that she actually spent her summer writing eighty-two letters to Lucas, one letter for everyday, which she never sent. During their "non-exclusive" arrangement, however, Lucas refuses to date anybody else in an effort to prove his loyalty to Brooke.
