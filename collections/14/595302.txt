In July 2012, it was reported that Sony Pictures Television had secured the rights to Gabaldon's Outlander series, with Moore attached to develop the project and Jim Kohlberg (Story Mining and Supply Co) producing.[4] Sony closed the deal with Starz in November 2012,[5] and Moore hired a writing team in April 2013.[6] That June, Starz picked up the Outlander project for a sixteen-episode order,[7] and in August it was announced that John Dahl would be directing the first two episodes.[8] Starz CEO Chris Albrecht later said that he had greenlighted several genre projects, including Outlander, to shift the network's series development toward "audiences that were being underserved" to "drive a real fervent fan base that then becomes the kind of advocacy group for the shows themselves".[9] Calling it "a different kind of show than has ever been on, in my memory", Albrecht believed that Outlander's combination of fantasy, action, a strong central romance and a feminist focus would set it apart.[9]
