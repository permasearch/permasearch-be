The Taking of Deborah Logan holds a 84% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from six critics.[4] Ain't it Cool News called it "found footage done right... one of the most effective entries in the popular subgenre"[5] while The Wrap named it a "Netflix Horror Gem", calling the film "one of the freshest entries in American possession horror".[6] Nerdist and Dread Central both wrote mostly positive reviews for the film,[7] with Dread Central commenting that while the film would not appeal to everyone, "if you're looking for a spooky little film that's free of pretension and sometimes logic and are into getting some quick shivers, you really cannot go wrong".[8] In contrast, Bloody Disgusting panned the film, stating that it was unduly derivative of other similarly themed works to be truly effective and that other than a specific scene near the end, "the film brings nothing new to the table".[9]
