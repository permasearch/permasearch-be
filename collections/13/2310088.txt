Leopardstar loses her final life in Fading Echoes. She is replaced by her deputy, Mistyfoot, now Mistystar.[25] Mistystar is Bluestar's daughter, and is said to meet Stonefur, Silverstream, and Bluestar in Fading Echoes, although this may not be true. The Erins also said after news of Leopardstar's death reached fans that one of the true reasons why she had allied her Clan with Tigerstar in The Darkest Hour was because she was in love with Tigerstar.[24]
