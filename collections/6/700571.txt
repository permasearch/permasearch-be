Avelar is a civil parish of the municipality of Ansião, Portugal. It is also a Sephardic Jewish name deriving from an old form of Arabic for the word "running".[citation needed] The name was later appended to the town as a result of the Jewish expulsions from Spain (1391, 1492) and the subsequent resettlement of Jews in Portugal.[1][better source needed][2]
