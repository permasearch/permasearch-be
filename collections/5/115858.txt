In 1866, Austria granted a degree of autonomy to Galicia after its own defeat in the Austro-Prussian War.[51] Politically freer Kraków became a Polish national symbol and a centre of culture and art, known frequently as the "Polish Athens" (Polskie Ateny) or "Polish Mecca".[52] Many leading Polish artists of the period resided in Kraków,[53] among them the seminal painter Jan Matejko,[54] laid to rest at Rakowicki Cemetery, and the founder of modern Polish drama, Stanisław Wyspiański.[55] Fin de siècle Kraków evolved into a modern metropolis; running water and electric streetcars were introduced in 1901, and between 1910 and 1915, Kraków and its surrounding suburban communities were gradually combined into a single administrative unit called Greater Kraków (Wielki Kraków).[56][57]
