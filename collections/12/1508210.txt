The Deccans left an important heritage of the Indo-Islamic art and language and spread Islamic tradition in South India. Hazrat Banda Nawaz (1321-1422 CE) the great Sufi saint was patronized by the Bahamani kings. His dargah of Gulbarga is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus and Muslims alike. A great scholar of Islamic lore, he founded the Madrassa (institution) from his own funds on the line of universities of Samarkand and Khorasan.[citation needed] A selfless worker, he became a prime minister of Bahamani king Mahmud III (1462â€“82), whom he had tutored in earlier days. Gawan became a victim of the palace intrigue and was beheaded by the drunken king.[citation needed] The later kings of the Bahamani dynasty were too weak to keep the kingdom intact, leading to breakup.[citation needed]
