The mobile identification number (MIN) or mobile subscription identification number (MSIN) refers to the 10-digit unique number that a wireless carrier uses to identify a mobile phone, which is the last part of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). The MIN is a number that uniquely identifies a mobile phone working under TIA standards for cellular and PCS technologies. (e.g. EIA/TIA–553 analog, IS–136 TDMA, IS–95 or IS-2000 CDMA). It can also be called the MSID (Mobile Station ID) or IMSI_S (Short IMSI).
