In December 2010, Neiers was arrested again, this time for possession of heroin.[28] Rather than being sentenced to further time behind bars, she was allowed to live at a luxury rehab facility in Malibu for a year, having been offered her stay free of charge by the facility's owner, who attended her hearing. She was at the facility from December 2010 until December 2011. In an entry posted to her blog in April 2013, she stated that she has been sober since then, and has become a counselor interning at the facility.[29] She is now married to Canadian businessman Evan Haines, whom she met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and together they have a daughter, Harper.[26][30]
