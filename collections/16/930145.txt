ZoÃ« Kravitz was expected to return in the sequel for a "meatier" role after her cameo in the first film.[21][8] On 1 November 2016, Deadline.com reported that Johnny Depp had joined the film for an unspecified role in the film, which was later revealed to be Gellert Grindelwald, for which he also filmed a small role in the first film but would play a larger role in the sequel.[6][7] Depp's casting received criticism by some fans based on his previous involvement in domestic violence allegations.[22][23] J. K. Rowling posted on her website that she resisted recasting because Depp and his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, had previously expressed hope that the mutual agreement would enable both to move on from the controversy and that "the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies."[24] Director David Yates revealed that character Albus Dumbledore would be back in the film but it would be played by a younger actor, not Michael Gambon, and he also revealed that the second film would be set in the United Kingdom and Paris.[7] A number of big name actors, including Christian Bale, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Mark Strong were considered for the role, while Jared Harris, son of Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter films, was also considered.[25] Later, Yates revealed that he would be directing all five films, stating "I love making films, and I've got a great team, all of whom are like family."[26] James Newton Howard revealed in an interview with Forbes that he would be returning to compose the score for the sequel.[27]
