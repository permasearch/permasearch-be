Throwing a grenade upstairs is dangerous, due to the risk of it falling back down; it is much safer to throw a grenade downstairs, so it is safer to capture a building from the top, rather than the bottom.[39] Grenades generally explode near the floor, causing spalling downwards towards lower floors.[42]
