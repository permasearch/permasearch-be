Back at Higgins Haven, a scorned Shelley scares Vera with a hockey mask and then wanders into the barn where Jason slashes his throat and takes his mask. The killer then proceeds to shoot Vera in the eye with a spear-gun. Jason then enters the house and slices a head-standing Andy in half with a machete. Debbie has a knife shoved through her chest while resting on a hammock. When the power goes out in the house, Chuck goes down to the basement where Jason hurls him into the fuse box, electrocuting him. Chili is then impaled with a hot fire poker. When Rick's car dies, Chris and Rick are forced to walk back to the house to find it in disarray. Rick steps outside to search the grounds, but Jason grabs him and crushes his skull with his bare hands.
