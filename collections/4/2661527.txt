In early spring the consul, Quintus Marcius, sailed with 5,000 men to reinforce his legions, disembarked at Ambracia and moved towards Thessaly. Figulus took his fleet into the gulf of Corinth, left his ships at Creusa, and went to join the fleet stationed at Chalcis overland. Aulus Hostilius, who had been protecting Romeâ€™s allies, had restored discipline in his troops and was encamped in Thessaly; he handed over his troops and returned to Rome. The consul started marching towards Macedon. Perseus sent troops to the mountain passes into Macedon.[38]
