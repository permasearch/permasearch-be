Within the European Union, GMP inspections are performed by National Regulatory Agencies. For example, GMP inspections are performed in Canada by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate[14]; the United Kingdom by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA))[15]; in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS)[16]; in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)[17]; in Bangladesh by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA)[18]; in South Africa by the Medicines Control Council (MCC)[19]; in Brazil by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA)[20]; in India by state Food and Drugs Administrations (FDA), reporting to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization[21]; in Pakistan by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan[22]; in Nigeria by NAFDAC[23]; and by similar national organisations worldwide. Each of the inspectorates carry out routine GMP inspections to ensure that drug products are produced safely and correctly. Additionally, many countries perform pre-approval inspections (PAI) for GMP compliance prior to the approval of a new drug for marketing.
