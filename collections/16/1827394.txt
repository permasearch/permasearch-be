The film then shows a high school prom with the character "Peggy Loomis" playing a trombone. The officers were setting up decoys in an attempt to capture the Phantom. Betty Jo Booker, who played saxophone (not a trombone) was playing at a Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) social event (not a prom), and officers did not set up decoys until after her friend Paul Martin and her murders. In the film, "Peggy" and "Roy" are a couple, but Booker and Martin were only friends in real life.  Martin and she were shot to death, and her saxophone was missing for six months.[28] In the film, "Deputy Ramsey" collects the victim's instrument as evidence.
