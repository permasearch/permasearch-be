Daylight is an ideal light source because it provides high circadian stimulation during the day.  Daylight also has the correct intensity and spectrum needed to stimulate the circadian systems.[23] Architectural designs should consider adding sun rooms, skylights, patios, and courtyards into the design of facilities for the elderly.  Architects can also select lighting fixtures that emit an array of blue light LEDS (λmax=470 nm) which deliver at least 30 lux at the corner.  Lighting schemes that have timers are also helpful in providing the right type of light at the right type of day.
