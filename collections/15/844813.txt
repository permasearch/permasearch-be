The lieutenant governor and the legislature are the two components of the parliament in each of the provinces,[69] the former's authority therein being embodied in each house's mace, which all bear a crown at their apex.[70] Also, the enacting formula in most provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and New Brunswick) reads as: "Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of [Province], enacts as follows..."[71] The viceroy, who may alone summon, prorogue, and dissolve the legislative assembly, drop the writs for a general election, and read the Speech From the Throne, does not, however, participate in the legislative process, save for the granting of Royal Assent, which is required to make into law a bill passed by the legislature. The lieutenant governor may deny Royal Assent or reserve a bill for the governor general's decision, though the federal viceroy may further defer the bill to the monarch, who can disallow the bill within a time limit specified by the constitution. A bill has not been reserved for the governor general's consideration since 1961;[n 11][74] Royal Assent has not been denied since the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island did so in 1935.[75]
