The game placed first in the player's poll "Top 30" in Nintendo Power's first issue[47] and continued to dominate the list into the early 1990s. The Legend of Zelda was also voted by Nintendo Power readers as the "Best Challenge" in the Nintendo Power Awards '88.[48] The magazine also listed it as the best Nintendo Entertainment System video game ever created, stating that it was fun despite its age and it showed them new ways to do things in the genre such as hidden dungeons and its various weapons.[49] GamesRadar ranked it the third best NES game ever made.
