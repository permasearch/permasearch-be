The Titanic offered the finest and most luxurious First-Class accommodations to be found on any contemporary ocean liner. The cheapest First-Class fare could be had for £23 (appr. £2484 in 2017 GBP), without meals.[2] A suite could range in price from £400 (£43,200 in 2017) to £870 (£93,960 in 2017) for a "Deluxe" Parlour Suite at the height of the travelling season. This would be the equivalent of over $116,000 in 2017 dollars for Titanic's most expensive accommodation.[2][3]
