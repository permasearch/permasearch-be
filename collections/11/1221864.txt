Beginning with the 2003 season, big changes began to sweep through the organization to try to snap the losing ways. General manager Syd Thrift was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired Jim Beattie as the Executive Vice President and Mike Flanagan as the Vice President of Baseball Operations'. After another losing season, manager Mike Hargrove was not retained and Yankees coach Lee Mazzilli was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in shortstop Miguel Tejada, catcher Javy LÃ³pez, and former Oriole firstbaseman Rafael Palmeiro. The following season, the Orioles traded for outfielder Sammy Sosa.
