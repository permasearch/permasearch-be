Sewage discharged from cities,towns and some villages is the predominant cause of water pollution in India.[1] Investment is needed to bridge the gap between sewage India generates and its treatment capacity of sewage per day.[6] Major cities of India produce 38,354 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage, but the urban sewage treatment capacity is only 11,786 MLD.[7] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.
