Heaven's Gate finished shooting in March 1980, having cost nearly $30 million.[35] Reportedly, during post-production Cimino changed the lock to the studio's editing room, prohibiting executives from seeing the film until he completed his cut, although Cimino disputed the story.[36] Working with Oscar-winning editor William H. Reynolds, Cimino slaved over his project.[33] As one person involved in the project noted, "Michael didn't want respect. He wanted awe. The idea was that the magic man was in his workshop doing his magic, and we should all just leave him alone and let him finish."
