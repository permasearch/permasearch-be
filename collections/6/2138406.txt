Some of the principles of this apparatus were described when Vladimir Zworykin filed two patents for a Television system in 1923 and 1925.[1][2] A research group at RCA headed by Zworykin presented the iconoscope to the general public in a press conference in June 1933,[3] and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year.[4][5] The German company Telefunken bought the rights from RCA and built the superikonoskop camera[6] used for the historical TV transmission at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.
