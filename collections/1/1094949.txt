The accuracy of the k-NN algorithm can be severely degraded by the presence of noisy or irrelevant features, or if the feature scales are not consistent with their importance. Much research effort has been put into selecting or scaling features to improve classification. A particularly popular[citation needed] approach is the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize feature scaling.[6] Another popular approach is to scale features by the mutual information of the training data with the training classes.[citation needed]
