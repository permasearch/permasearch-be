Agriculture in the Mackenzie River basin is mainly concentrated in the southern portion of the watershed, namely the valleys of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. The valley of the former river is considered to be some of the best northern farmland in Canada, due to the high concentration of minerals found in the soil.[34] These conditions are expected to be improved even more by recent trends in climate change, such as warmer temperatures and a longer growing season.[44][45] It is even said that "there is enough agricultural capability in the Peace River Valley to provide vegetables to all of northern Canada".[46] However, reaches of the Peace River Valley are threatened with flooding by the proposed Site C Dam, which would generate enough electricity to power about 460,000 households. Site C has been the center of a protracted and ongoing environmental battle since the 1970s, and a decision has not yet been reached as to whether or not to build the dam.[46][47]
