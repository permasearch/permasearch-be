The Griffins return home, where Meg reverts to her old look. It is then revealed that the last scene is the final sketch on an episode of Saturday Night Live and Peter thanks the audience for watching. When Showtime at the Apollo starts, the TV screen goes blank. Brian turns to the audience and claims that he only turned off the show because he always goes to sleep at 1:00Â a.m., and not because the show has African-American entertainers on it. Brian then angrily barks at the home audience.
