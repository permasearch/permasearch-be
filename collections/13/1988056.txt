The identical name "Bespin Security Guard" is given to two action figures. The first figure (No. 39810) is white, the second figure (No. 69640) is black.[8] On card-backs the two Bespin Security Guards are shown separately, but still labeled with the same name. C-3PO (Removable Limbs) – No. 69430 / No. 69600 – is not confirmed to exist on a U.S. release 45-Back "The Empire Strikes Back" card.[9] The 47-Back is considered to be the premiere cardback for this figure.[9]
