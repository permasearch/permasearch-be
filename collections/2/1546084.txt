Rosberg further extended his championship lead to thirty-three points in Japan, starting the race from pole and finishing in first. Meanwhile, Hamilton made another poor start, slipping from second on the grid to eighth by the end of the first lap. He recovered with an alternate pit strategy to reclaim third place going into the final phase of the race but was unable to pass Max Verstappen, and finished in third, meaning that his deficit to Rosberg was now 33 points and that the Championship was no longer in his hands. The result secured Mercedes's third consecutive World Constructors' Championship title.[204] Hamilton began to reduce Rosberg's lead, fronting a Mercedes 1–2 finish in the United States.[205] Hamilton led another Mercedes 1–2 in Mexico and in Brazil, he dominated a heavily wet race to complete another hat-trick of wins. However with Rosberg again finishing in second it meant that to win the championship, he would have to win the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with Rosberg finishing fourth or lower.
