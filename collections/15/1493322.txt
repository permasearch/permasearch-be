They are usually caused by a bacterial infection.[8] Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection.[6] In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.[1] Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world.[3] Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like, and is confirmed by cutting it open.[1] Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear.[1] In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.[3]
