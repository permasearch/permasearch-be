Inductees to the National Radio Hall of Fame are nominated by a 24-person Nominating Committee composed of industry programming leaders and executives, industry observers and members of academia.[2] The Nominating Committee is inclusive of commercial and public radio.  Nominating Committee members serve two or three year terms on a volunteer basis.  The committee receives suggestions from the industry and listening public before convening and presenting a slate of 24 nominees, 16 of which are voted upon by an industry-wide Voting Participant panel while 8 others are voted on by the public.[3] The Nominating Committee subsequently chooses up to four additional individuals for induction, choosing from suggested air personalities, programmers, management or ownership.[4]
