The four tenets of the Landdyke Movement are relationship with the land, liberation and transformation, living the politics, and bodily Freedoms.[43] Most importantly, members of these communities seek to live outside of a patriarchal society that puts emphasis on "beauty ideals that discipline the female body, compulsive heterosexuality, competitiveness with other women, and dependence".[44] Instead of adhering typical female gender roles, the women of Landdyke communities value "self-sufficiency, bodily strength, autonomy from men and patriarchal systems, and the development of lesbian-centered community".[44] Members of the Landdyke movement enjoy bodily freedoms that have been deemed unacceptable in the modern Western worldâ€”such as the freedom to expose their breasts, or to go without any clothing at all.[45] An awareness of their impact on the Earth, and connection to nature is essential members of the Landdyke Movement's way of life.[46]
