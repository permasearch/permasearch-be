Reportedly, this design has been advertised as having a core damage probability of only 3×10−8 core damage events per reactor-year.[citation needed] That is, there would need to be 3 million ESBWRs operating before one would expect a single core-damaging event during their 100-year lifetimes. Earlier designs of the BWR, the BWR/4, had core damage probabilities as high as 1×10−5 core-damage events per reactor-year.[7] This extraordinarily low CDP for the ESBWR far exceeds the other large LWRs on the market.
