O'Sullivan did not win any ranking titles during the 1994/1995 season, but reached two finals. He lost to James Wattana in the final of the Thailand Open[38] and to John Higgins in the final of the British Open.[39] At the Masters, O'Sullivan captured his first title by defeating Higgins 9–3 in the final.[34][40] With this victory, he became the youngest player ever to win the tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days.[41] and came a step closer to collecting all the Triple Crown events, only requiring a world title to complete his collection. At the World Championship, he recorded his furthest run yet by reaching the quarter-finals, where he lost 8–13 to Stephen Hendry.[42]
