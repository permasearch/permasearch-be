Gunnar Hansen was approached to recreate his role as Leatherface but he claimed to have been offered "scale plus ten percent" with the ten percent going to his agent. When he replied that he had no agent, they offered scale without the additional ten percent. Hansen found the offer too low.[8] Unit publicist Scott Holton offered an alternate story claiming Hansen vacillated about the part and the offer was rescinded.[8] Holton didn't believe the average viewer was even aware of the original actors were claiming "who are Neal, Hansen or Burns?"[8]
