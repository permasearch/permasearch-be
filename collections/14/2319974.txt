In April 2017, Volkswagen USA announced that it would continue to sell its outgoing Tiguan alongside its successor, the all new 2018 Tiguan. The new model, called the Tiguan Limited, will offer a lower price point than that of its successor, all while offering an excellent value in terms of standard and optional equipment.[13]
