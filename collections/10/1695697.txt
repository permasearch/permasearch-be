Trade associations were formed first in the U.S. in 1947 with the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), followed by the Institute of Public Relations (now the Chartered Institute of Public Relations) in London in 1948. Similar trade associations were created in Australia, Europe, South Africa, Italy and Singapore. The International Association of Public Relations was founded in 1955.[37][40] The Institute for Public Relations held its first conference in 1949 and that same year the first British book on PR, "Public Relations and publicity" was published by J.H. Brebner.[100] The International Association of Business Communicators was founded in 1970.[99] Betsy Ann Plank is called "the first lady of public relations" for becoming the first female president of the PRSA in 1973.[99]
