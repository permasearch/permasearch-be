Principal photography began on June 14, 2010, in Hawaii.[17][47] Filming was moved to California in August 2010,[48] primarily at the Long Beach shore[33] and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot,[17] as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides.[22] After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico,[33] with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Crist√≥bal in San Juan,[49] production moved to the United Kingdom in September, where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting.[17] Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London,[23] Knole House in Kent,[33] and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich.[50] Interiors were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, and a replica of an 18th-century London street was built on the backlot alongside the soundstages.[33][51] The producers also considered using New Orleans as a location.[52] In October, security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack.[53]
