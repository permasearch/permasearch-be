On 1 September 2005, the fifth anniversary of the original Smoothwall firewall, an alpha version of Smoothwall 3.0 was released, code named "Grizzly", followed by "Panda" on December 23, 2005 and "Koala" on December 22, 2006. Express 3 uses the 2.6 Linux kernel and a new build system developed internally at Smoothwall Ltd. As Express 3 development continued, the team gradually expanded to include outside volunteers again. A subsequent beta release, named "Degu", increased driver support and added a new look GUI.
