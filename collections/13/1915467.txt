The second idea is that Mill says there is a difference between harm and offence.[citation needed] Harm is something that would injure the rights of someone else or set back important interests that benefit others. An example of harm would be assaulting someone, causing them injury. An offence, according to Mill, is something that we would say 'hurt our feelings.'[citation needed] These are less serious and should not be prevented, because what may hurt one person's feelings may not hurt another's, and so offences are not universal.
