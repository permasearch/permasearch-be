In addition to heading the accounting department, Angela is also the former head of the Party Planning Committee and the office's Safety Officer. She is a constant source of complaints to Human Resources, although she retracts those lodged against Dwight Schrute at the onset of their secret romance. Angela lives with several cats, adores posters of infants posed as adults, and is a vegetarian and a singer. When she makes a mistake, Angela's first response is usually to shift the blame to someone else, along with an insult. Angela's extreme religious homophobia makes her dislike Will & Grace (although she says it's because it's "terribly loud"), except for the scenes with Harry Connick, Jr. ("He's so talented"). She is a former child beauty pageant contestant, and says that she enjoys being judged. She tends to list colors that she finds "whorish", including orange and green, that always seem to correspond to the color of clothes being worn by either Phyllis or Meredith. Angela bottles up her emotions to the point that, on occasion, she has private, emotional outbursts over relatively trivial matters. She also seems to be something of a conservative (albeit hypocritical) Christian. She states that the two books she would bring with her to read if stranded on a deserted island are the Bible and The Purpose Driven Life. Further, she would bring The Da Vinci Code, but only so she could burn it. She despises the mystery novel genre because, in her words, "I hate being titillated." However, in a deleted scene from "Dream Team", she says her new boss Charles Miner is mysterious and wants to flip to "his last page". In a deleted scene from Season 3, Angela glowingly compares Dwight to Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. She says in Prince Family Paper that her ideal of male beauty is Boris Becker.
