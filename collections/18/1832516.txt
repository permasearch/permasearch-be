The push for the dry movement was done primarily by Protestant churches but was never as simple as a Protestant-Catholic issue. The only province that was under prohibition before 1914 was Prince Edward Island but some municipalities across Canada had gone dry under provincial local option. World War One became the driving force behind the “banning of the bar,” but similar in influence were the crusading spirit of the Social Gospel and the effective arguments of progressivism. In late 1917 the federal Union government prohibited importation of alcohol of more than 2.5 percent into Canada as well as the shipping of alcohol into a province under prohibition, and announced a ban on production. National prohibition was the first and last attempt to impose national standards on the production, distribution, and consumption of alcohol.[12]
