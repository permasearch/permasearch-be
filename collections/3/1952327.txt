Following Kristen's eviction, HouseGuests competed in the "True Colors" endurance Head of Household competition.[41] For this competition, HouseGuests stood on an over-sized paint can while holding onto railing on the sides in an attempt to be the last one remaining on the can. The first HouseGuest to drop from the competition would be the only Have-Not for the week.[115] Matt was the winner, while Kathy became the Have-Not for the week.[116] On Day 35, Matt was given the opportunity to open Pandora's Box; he chose to open it.[117] He was awarded with the Diamond Power of Veto, which he could use during a live eviction to remove one nominated HouseGuest from the block as well as name the replacement nominee.[118][119] Due to Matt opening the box, however, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that a new Saboteur was in the game, with the viewers deciding who the new Saboteur should be; Ragan was selected.[120] Unlike Annie, the new Saboteur would earn $20,000 for completing two weeks worth of sabotage and would not be removed from the game.[121] Matt later lied to his fellow HouseGuests, claiming he had only won a dollar while inside Pandora's Box.[122] Later that day, Matt chose to nominate Brendon and Rachel for eviction.[123][124] When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Britney, Enzo, and Kathy were selected to compete; Ragan, who won a Veto Ticket in the previous Power of Veto competition, was also able to compete. On Day 36, HouseGuests competed in the "Lovers Lane" Power of Veto competition.[41] For this competition, former HouseGuests Jordan Lloyd and Jeff Schroeder returned as hosts. One HouseGuests would attempt to knock down as many pins as possible within forty-five seconds, and then challenge one HouseGuest to challenge; if the challenged HouseGuest does better than their challenger, then the challenger is eliminated.[125] Britney was the winner of the Power of Veto.[126][127] Rachel, in an attempt to get Britney to use the Power of Veto, offered Britney the $5,000 Rachel had won in the previous Power of Veto competition; Rachel believed that if Kathy was nominated against Brendon then Kathy would be evicted.[128] Britney denied to do so, telling Rachel that all of the HouseGuests were against Brendon and Rachel, thus using the Power of Veto would be pointless.[129] On Day 38, Britney chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee.[130] Brendon later engaged in numerous arguments with his fellow HouseGuests in an attempt to convince them to evict him over Rachel.[131] On Day 41, Rachel became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.[132][133][134] She became the first member of the Jury of Seven.
