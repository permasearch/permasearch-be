The animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars ran from 2008 to 2014 and was set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.[27][28][29][30] This new series overwrote certain aspects of earlier Clone Wars EU works, such as Anakin now having a Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and being knighted much earlier in the war.[citation needed] Lucas discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it.[31]
