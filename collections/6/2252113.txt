The official music video was directed by Adam Bernstein. According to Bernstein, Public Enemy originally wanted Joey Ramone to play a prisoner in the video. However, Ramone refused, as group member Professor Griff had recently been reported making anti-Semitic remarks - despite not appearing in the video.[2]
