In the United States, several restaurant chains (such as Chili's) market a "Southwest Egg Roll", which is a Tex-Mex dish consisting of a deep-fried flour tortilla containing (among other ingredients) corn, black beans, spinach, chicken, Monterey jack cheese, peppers, and other spices. Other variations on the egg roll, especially common on menus of bar appetizers in the Northeastern United States, include the pizza roll (filled with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese) and the cheese steak roll (imitating the Philadelphia cheese steak with chopped beef and cheese).
