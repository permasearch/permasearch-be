When the first wave of emigrants left Quebec, the local government did not pay much attention as the numbers were relatively small. However, when the emigration began to increase and the provincial economy was going through a depression, leaders of the province attempted to halt the emigration.[clarification needed] The church warned of hell being destined for those who decided to leave. Nevertheless, more than 200,000 left between 1879â€“1901.[40]
