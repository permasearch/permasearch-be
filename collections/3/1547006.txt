In contrast to the multi-component model, some researchers believe that STM should be viewed as a unitary construct.[3] In this respect, visual, spatial, and verbal information are thought to be organized by levels of representation rather than the type of store to which they belong.[3] Within the literature, it is suggested that further research into the fractionation of STM and WM be explored.[3][4] However, much of the research into the visuo-spatial memory construct have been conducted in accordance to the paradigm advanced by Baddeley and Hitch.[2][3][4][5][6]
