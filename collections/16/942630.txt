In September 1914, the British submarine HMS E9 successfully torpedoed the German cruiser SMS Hela.[45] Remembering Wilson's statements, commanding officer Max Horton instructed his submariners to manufacture a Jolly Roger, which was flown from the submarine as she entered port.[44][45] Each successful patrol saw Horton's submarine fly an additional Jolly Roger until there was no more room for flags, at which point Horton had a large Jolly Roger manufactured, onto which symbols indicating E9's achievements were sewn.[45] A small number of other submarines adopted the practice:[45] HMS E12 flew a red flag with the skull and crossbones on return from a foray into the Dardanelles in June 1915,[46] and the first known photograph of the practice was taken in July 1916 aboard HMS H5.[47]
