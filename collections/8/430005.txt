Although norms of masculinity were dominant, strong minded women originated a feminist movement starting in the 1860s, well before women gained the right to vote in 1893.[49] Middle class women employed the media (especially newspapers) to communicate with each other and define their priorities. Prominent feminist writers included Mary Taylor,[50] Mary Colclough (pseud. Polly Plum),[51] and Ellen Ellis.[52] The first signs of a politicised collective female identity came in crusades to pass the Contagious Diseases Prevention Act.[53][54]
