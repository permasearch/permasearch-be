At present, it is believed that survival of C. dentata for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible.  The fungus uses various oak trees as a host,[14] and while the oak itself is unaffected, American chestnuts nearby will succumb to the blight in approximately a year or more.[15] In addition, the hundreds of chestnut stumps and "living stools" dotting eastern woodlands may still contain active pathogens.
