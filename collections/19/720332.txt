May-Li is going on holiday, so a temporary careworker is brought in, Sam. Floss falls down the steps and is taken to hospital. Kazima goes shopping in order to meet a homeless boy, Alex. When Floss returns, she convinces some of the young people she has magical powers by guessing correctly the cards Chloe has. Kazima tracks Alex down and he runs off with the food shopping. Floss thinks her powers are getting stronger and Toni finds out Floss cheated with the cards by using the mirror reflection. Floss takes a file on the young people for Sam and Sam sends Kazima to her room when he doesn't believe the shopping was stolen. Kazima and Tyler sneak out to find Alex, whilst Candi-Rose distracts Mike and Sam. They go to a building, where they find Alex squatting and an ill man, George. Toni realises Floss took Sam's file to convince the others she can mind read and Kazima sneaks Alex into The Dumping Ground. Floss struggles to convince the others she has powers when Ryan blocks the mirror and Toni takes the file. Alex reveals to Kazima and Tyler that he was put into care and Mike and Sam find out about Alex when Finn lets it slip. Floss admits she doesn't have powers and the young people are annoyed with Kazima when Alex takes their things. Kazima and Sam go to the squat to find Alex and retrieve the young people's things. Mike gives Sam a warning.
