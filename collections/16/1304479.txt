In February 2008, after an undercover investigation conducted by HSUS at the Westland Meat Packing Company alleged substantial animal abuse, the USDA forced the recall of 143 million pounds of beef, some of which had been routed into the nation's school lunch program.[89] HSUS had been a longtime advocate for the elimination of downer animals from the nation's food supply, and the undercover investigation led to the USDA adopting the policy.[90] In November 2013, the Justice Department reached a $155 million settlement with the firms that operated the plant.[91] Michael Greger, Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for HSUS at that time, testified before Congress about the matter.[92]
