The country has plenty of rivers and reservoirs, which makes it a suitable climate for fish farming. Fishing takes place in the lakes and rivers, particularly in the Kabul River around the Jalalabad area and in the Helmand River in southern Afghanistan. Fish constitute a smaller part of the Afghan diet today because fish farmers are unable to produce enough fish to keep up with the demands of customers. Most fish and seafood is imported from neighboring Pakistan, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. In recent years, USAID has helped many Afghans in establishing fish farms across the country.[14] There are hundreds of fish farms throughout the country and the largest one is at the Qargha, which supplies fish eggs to the other fish farms. Fish farming has also been launched in the Salma Dam.[15]
