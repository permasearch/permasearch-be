As early as the Uruk period (ca. 4000â€“3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of Uruk.[2] During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.[2] The famous Uruk Vase (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,[17] and bringing sheep and goats to a female figure facing the ruler.[18] The female figure holds Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,[18] while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later cuneiform sign signifying En, or high priest of the temple.[19]
