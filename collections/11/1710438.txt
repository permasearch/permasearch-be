The previous government, under Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, announced on 5 December 2007 that the mandatory fluoridation of most of Queensland's water supplies will begin in 2008.[31] When it was enacted the Water Fluoridation Act 2008 required the addition of fluoride to any water supply supplying potable water to at least 1000 members of the public, unless an exemption is granted based on safety or naturally occurring levels that meet the required levels.[32] The fluoridation of drinking water supplies is regulated by Queensland Health,[33] with implementation supported by the former Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.[34] Prior to this legislation Queensland was the only Australian state without a formal statewide program for the addition of fluoride to drinking water.
