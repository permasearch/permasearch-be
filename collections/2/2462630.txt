Though he hangs out with a group of friends, seemingly on rotation in the first season, the one constant is Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong), who later takes on the role of his sole best friend throughout the series. Shawn is his partner in crime and often the cause of the mischief,[4] joining in on the wisecracks in the back row of Mr. Feeny's classroom. Two other recurring characters in the first season are Stuart Minkus (Lee Norris) and Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel). Both Minkus and Topanga are smart, nerdy, strange outcasts, whom Cory and Shawn constantly poke fun at both directly and indirectly. While his relationship with nerdy Minkus remains the same, Cory gradually moves past his aversion to girls phase and develops some sort of affection for Topanga by the end of the season.[5]
