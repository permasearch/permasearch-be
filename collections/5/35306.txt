Testing before the onset of symptoms is a life-changing event and a very personal decision.[25] The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions.[25] Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50â€“70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested.[53] Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment.[25] A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result.[24] Irrespective of the result, stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result.[24] Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected.[24] Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it.[24] In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations.[54] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process.[55] Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.[56]
