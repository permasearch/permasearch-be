In 1954 the American CBS television network paid Ian Fleming $1,000[5] ($8,918 in 2016 dollars[6]) for the rights to turn his first novel, Casino Royale, into a one-hour television adventure[7] as part of the dramatic anthology series Climax Mystery Theater, which ran between October 1954 and June 1958.[8] It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and Charles Bennett; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, including The 39 Steps and Sabotage.[9] Due to the restriction of a one-hour play, the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book, although it retained its violence, particularly in Act III.[9] The hour-long "Casino Royale" episode, which starred American actor Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production.[10]
