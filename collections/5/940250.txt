In March 1997, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based First Bank System announced the pending acquisition of the Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp of Oregon for $9 billion in stock.[60][61][62] At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming.  Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System would be renamed U.S. Bancorp with the headquarters for the newly combined company being at First Bank's existing headquarters in Minneapolis. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997.[63] Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland.[64]
