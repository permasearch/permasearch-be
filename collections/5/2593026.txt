But the site for the President's grave was quickly changed to the hillside just below Arlington House. The site was chosen because the President and his friend, architect John Carl Warnecke, happened to visit the site in March 1963 and the President had admired the peaceful atmosphere of the location.[5][6][7][8] The initial suggestion to bury President Kennedy at Arlington appears to have been made by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.[9][10] First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy agreed to the change.[9] Although Kennedy's sisters and many of his long-time associates from Massachusetts were opposed to burial at Arlington, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy visited the site with McNamara on Saturday, November 23, and concluded that Mrs. Kennedy's wishes should be honored.[9][10]
