Urbilaterian: Bilateria/Triploblasts, Nephrozoa (555 ka), last common ancestor of protostomes (including the arthropod [insect, crustacean] and platyzoan [flatworms] lineages) and the deuterostomes (including the vertebrate [human] lineage). Earliest development of the brain, and of bilateral symmetry.  Archaic representatives of this stage are flatworms,  the simplest animals with organs that form from three germ layers.
