The design capacity is 135,000 vehicles per day, but in practice the crossing carries around 160,000.[8] It has been described by the Highways Agency as "a vital transport link for the national and South East economies",[9] by the former Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, as "a crucial part of the countryâ€™s strategic road network",[10] and by the local Thurrock Council as "one of Europe's most heavily used crossings and complex traffic management systems".[11] It is signed as a major destination on London's orbital route, the M25, though the crossing and its approach road are an all-purpose road (the A282),[b] allowing traffic prohibited from motorways to use it. Southbound traffic crosses the four-lane bridge, while northbound traffic uses both of the two-lane road tunnels. The bridge can be closed due to high winds[6] or maintenance. On these occasions, traffic uses the tunnels in both directions.[15]
