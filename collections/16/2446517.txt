Crawley Town F.C. is Crawley's main football team. Formed in 1896, it moved in 1949 to a ground at Town Mead adjacent to the West Green playing fields. Demand for land near the town centre led to the club moving in 1997 to the new Broadfield Stadium, now owned by the borough council.[183] As of the 2012/2013 season, Crawley Town play in League One, the third tier of league football in England. Perhaps the pinnacle of the club's history was in February 2011 when they played against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the fifth round of the F.A. Cup, a match which saw 9,000 Crawley fans make the trip to Manchester. Three other local teams play in the Sussex County Football League: Three Bridges F.C., Oakwood F.C. and Ifield Edwards F.C.. Crawley Rugby Club is based in Ifield,[184] and a golf course was constructed in 1982 at Tilgate Park.[185] Crawley Hockey Club plays their home matches at Hazelwick School, Three Bridges[186]
