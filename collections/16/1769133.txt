The question in respect of a sale of res sua is whether or not a person can enter into a valid contract of sale, involving the purchase of a thing that is (unbeknownst to him) his own property already. The general rule is that things owned by the buyer cannot be the subject of a valid sale.[13] It is possible, however, for the purchaser to buy rights in his own property that he does not yet hold.[14]
