Chuki is a small, light pink hatchback with a Japanese nationality, living in Tokyo. Chuki has a very small appearance in Cars-she is shown as one of the news reporters who appear in the multi-clip footage of various TV news channels reporting McQueen's sudden disappearance while being transported to the Los Angeles International Speedway for his tie-breaker final of the Piston Cup. In Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales episode "Tokyo Mater", Chuki is seen presenting a news broadcast on one of the large TVs installed in Tokyo. In Cars 2, she is seen in the neon advertisement glowboards in Tokyo.
