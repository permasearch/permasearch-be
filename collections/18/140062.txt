During their time, the pair released sixteen singles and three studio albums; however, none of their releases managed to reach number one, with their highest UK chart position being number three. The duo did, however, reach the top ten in Germany and Japan, and even had a number-one single in Germany, with their cover of the Everly Brothers' All I Have to Do Is Dream. Success also struck in other European countries. The duo had a short lived revival in the music industry, releasing a song for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, entitled We're on the Ball. The track peaked at No. 3,[12] being beaten by Will Young and Gareth Gates. On 23 March 2013 Ant and Dec performed Let's Get Ready To Rhumble as part of their show Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway which powered the song to number one on the UK iTunes chart and on Sunday 31 March 2013 the track was revealed as the Official UK Number 1 single on The Official Chart on BBC Radio 1. All money made from the re-release was donated to charity.[13]
