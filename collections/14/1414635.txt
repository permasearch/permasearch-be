Direct human-to-human transmission initially was believed to be caused only by occupational exposure, such as in a laboratory setting,[28] or conjunctive exposure to infected blood.[29] The US outbreak identified additional transmission methods through blood transfusion,[30] organ transplant,[31] intrauterine exposure,[32] and breast feeding.[33] Since 2003, blood banks in the United States routinely screen for the virus among their donors.[34] As a precautionary measure, the UK's National Blood Service initially ran a test for this disease in donors who donate within 28 days of a visit to the United States, Canada, or the northeastern provinces of Italy, and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service[35] asks prospective donors to wait 28 days after returning from North America or the northeastern provinces of Italy before donating. There also have been reports of possible transmission of the virus from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding or exposure to the virus in a lab, but these are rare cases and not conclusively confirmed.[36]
