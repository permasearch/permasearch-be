In the past twenty years, Kenyans have moved away from family farming towards jobs that pay wages or to start small businesses outside of agriculture.[20] In 1989, 4.5 million Kenyan's, out of a total working population of 7.3 million, worked on family farms.[20] In 2009, only 6.5 million Kenya's, 45 percent, out of a total working population of 14.3 million, work on family farms, as compared to Tanzania, where 66 of the working population worked on family farms.[20] More than half of family farm workers in Kenya are women, 3.8 million, compared to men who make up 2.7 million.[20]
