The weight on the front and rear axles differs which causes uneven wear.[citation needed] With the majority of cars having the engine in front, the front tires typically bear more weight than the rear tires. Front-wheel drive vehicles have not only the engine but also the transaxle in front, adding to the weight differential. Moreover, additional stress is placed disproportionately on the front tires by braking and steering.[citation needed] Thus, tire rotation needs to occur more frequently for front-wheel drive vehicles.
