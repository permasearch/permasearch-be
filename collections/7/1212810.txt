After the kernels are arranged in troughs, the skin of the kernel is cracked on opposite sides by rolling it through sharp stationary blades.  While the skins are removed, the kernels are brought through a one-minute hot water bath and placed on a swinging pad with canvas on top.  The swinging action of the pad rubs off the skins. Afterward, the blanched kernels are dried for at least six hours by hot air at 120 °F (49 °C).[21]
