On October 23, the NHC began forecasting an area with potential for tropical or subtropical development over the central Atlantic.[167] A large area of disturbed weather associated with a surface trough developed later that day.[168] Gradual organization ensued as the low drifted northward, with the shower and thunderstorm activity becoming better defined, although by October 26 it still lacked a well-defined surface circulation.[169] By 03:00 UTC on October 27, however, the circulation of the broad low had become sufficiently defined for it to be classified as Subtropical Storm Oscar.[170] Oscar continued to strengthen as it accelerated southward around the northern side of a mid to upper-level low, transitioning into a tropical storm at 05:00 UTC on October 28.[171] A small eye briefly became evident on satellite imagery in the evening of October 28, and Oscar strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 21:00 UTC that day.[172] A period of steady intensification followed, and Oscar became a Category 2 hurricane at 03:00 UTC on October 30.[173]
