The "Power of Three" has also been seen in other forms throughout the series. For example, in the season one episode "That 70s Episode", Patty casts a spell with young Prue and Piper as she is pregnant with Phoebe at the time. In another occurrence, Penny, Patty, and Piper use the "Power of Three" to banish the Hollow in the final episode "Forever Charmed".[6]
