Heart released Bebe le Strange in 1980.[6] It became the band's third top ten album, peaking at number five, and yielded the Top 40 hit "Even It Up".[27] The band embarked on a 77-city tour to promote the album.[28] By the end of the year, the band scored their highest charted single at the time; a version of the ballad "Tell It Like It Is", which peaked at number eight.[29] In November 1980, the double album Greatest Hits/Live was released and reached number twelve on the US chart,[30] eventually achieving double platinum status. The two-disc set featured studio versions of most of Heart's singles to date, plus a couple of new studio tracks and six live tracks, amongst which were versions of "Unchained Melody", Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" and The Beatles' "I'm Down".[31] But with a total of only two hit singles in 1980 (five singles were actually released) and a hiatus of almost two years to their next studio album, sales following this greatest hits package were weaker than previous efforts.
