On 7 October 2010, it was reported that Eurostar had selected Siemens as preferred bidder to supply 10 Siemens Velaro e320[165] trainsets at a cost of €600 million (and a total investment of more than £700 million with the refurbishment of the existing fleet included)[166] to operate an expanded route network, including services from London to Cologne and Amsterdam.[167] These would be sixteen-car, 400-metre (1,312 ft) long trainsets built to meet current Channel Tunnel regulations.[167] The top speed will be 320 km/h (199 mph) and they will have 894–950 seats, unlike the current fleet built by the French company Alstom, which has a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph) and a seating capacity of 750. Total traction power will be rated at 16 MW.[165][168][169][170]
