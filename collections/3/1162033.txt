Decompression theory is the study and modelling of the transfer of the inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressureâ€”but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure.[1][2] In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within a relatively short period of hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.[3]
