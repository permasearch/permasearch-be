On 6 June 2018, it was announced that Sharon Osbourne would return to judge the fifteenth series, but only for the live shows, due to her ongoing work commitments in the United States. The next day, long-serving judge Louis Walsh announced that after thirteen years on the show, he would leave to focus on other projects.[1] Earlier in the year, it was reported that Nicole Scherzinger would not return as a judge for the fifteenth series.[2] On 30 September 2018, Osbourne announced her decision to no longer appear as a judge during the live shows, stating that she had "seen the new judges finding their rhythm and are doing brilliantly".[3] This was clarified during an interview with Jane Moore for The Sun, where Osbourne confirmed she was originally hired as a full-time judge on the panel, fired, then rehired, and ultimately declined a reduced role on the show.[4]
