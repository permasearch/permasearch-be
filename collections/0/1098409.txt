In the early hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and started to fan out into the surrounding streets and buildings.[83] The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support.[84] At 04:00 hours, in the FÃ¼hrerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun.[85] At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to withdraw from the building.[86] To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.[87]
