Dominique Francon is the heroine of The Fountainhead, described by Rand as "the woman for a man like Howard Roark".[22] Rand described Dominique as similar to herself "in a bad mood".[23] For most of the novel, the character operates from what Rand viewed as wrong ideas.[24] Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses to turn away from them so that the world cannot harm her. Only at the end of the novel does she accept that she can be happy and survive.[23][25][26]
