Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Darren Franich gave the two-part premiere a B grade, praising Martin-Green's performance as the lead and the production design as well as commenting on the "undeniable appeal" of the "introduction of a new ship, the revelation that we're watching that ship's final voyage, the cliffhanger possibility that our new hero is a fallen angel." However, he felt that the series' third episode retroactively made the two episode prologue "feel even more overextended".[103] Patrick Cooley of cleveland.com criticized the first two episodes for having "bad dialogue, poor storytelling and wooden, bewilderingly stupid characters."[104] Brian Lowry from CNN called the first three episodes "Star Trek Lite", missing the interplay between characters, criticizing the bridge crew and lore, and further calling them an "unspectacular addition to the existing fleet of Trek-branded series [that] makes for an awkward liftoff, one perhaps most notable for its commercial mission, which is to entice new subscribers to CBS All Access."[105]
