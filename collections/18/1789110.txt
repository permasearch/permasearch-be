One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the π-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')[81] are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.[84] Several other Egyptian pyramids are very close to the rational 3:4:5 shape.[82]
