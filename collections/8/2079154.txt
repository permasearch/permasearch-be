The overall period may however instead be divided into contiguous sub-periods. This means that there is more than one time period, each sub-period beginning at the point in time where the previous one ended. In such a case, where there are multiple contiguous sub-periods, the return and rate of return over the overall period can be calculated, by combining together the returns within each of the sub-periods.
