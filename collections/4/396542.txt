When Rohan's death is repeated a second time, Josuke, Koichi, Okuyasu, and Jotaro are there to meet him. They see Hayato and figure out Kira is masquerading as his father, which causes Bites the Dust to kill all of them. This event is repeated again so Kira can learn who was killed, but this time Hayato tricks him into giving his own identity away before Rohan's death. Kira is forced to remove Bites the Dust from Hayato to protect himself as he fights Josuke, resulting in an end to the time-loop so that Rohan and the rest survive. With help from Josuke, Hayato, Okuyasu, and Koichi, Jotaro delivers a blow to Kira that propels him in front of an ambulance, killing him. Kira awakens as a ghost trapped in the same alley as Reimi, who informs him what happened. Kira attempts to attack Reimi once more, but she tricks him into turning around and the alley's phantoms drag him to the underworld.
