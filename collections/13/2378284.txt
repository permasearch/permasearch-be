An arrogant jock tries to seduce Santana to "make her normal". The female members of both glee clubs defend her, and together they sing "I Kissed a Girl". Santana comes out to her parents, who are accepting, but when she tells her abuela (grandmother), she tells Santana to leave and never return, saying it is a sin to speak of such things.
