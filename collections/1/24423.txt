The ability to score a touchdown on the point-after attempt (two-point conversion) was added to NCAA football in 1958, high school football in 1969, the CFL in 1975 and the NFL in 1994.[3][4] The short-lived World Football League, a professional American football league that operated in 1974 and 1975, gave touchdowns a 7-point value.
