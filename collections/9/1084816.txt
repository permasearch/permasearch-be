In Sri Lanka, returning officers are appointed by the Commissioner of Elections under the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980 for all Presidential, General (Parliamentary), Provincial and Local government elections held in the island. Normally public officers are appointed as returning officers and they may appoint assistant returning officers to assist them.[14]
