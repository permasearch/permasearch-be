It is proposed to determine in a series of     m   {\displaystyle m}   observations the limit of error, beyond which all observations involving so great an error may be rejected, provided there are as many as     n   {\displaystyle n}   such observations. The principle upon which it is proposed to solve this problem is, that the proposed observations should be rejected when the probability of the system of errors obtained by retaining them is less than that of the system of errors obtained by their rejection multiplied by the probability of making so many, and no more, abnormal observations.
