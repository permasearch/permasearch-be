The US system has weeks from Sunday through Saturday, and partial weeks at the beginning and the end of the year, i.e. 53 or 54 weeks. An advantage is that no separate year numbering like the ISO year is needed. Correspondence of lexicographical order and chronological order is preserved (just like with the ISO year-week-weekday numbering), but partial weeks make some computations of weekly statistics or payments inaccurate at end of December or beginning of January.
