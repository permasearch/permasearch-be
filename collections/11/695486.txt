With the increasing number of automobiles, American people started to get out of their homes and had dinner outside. However, during the war  people drove their cars as little as possible. Gas and tires were limited by the government. Car production ceased as factories had to manufacture tanks, Jeeps and other military vehicles. After the war families piled into cars again, as a consequence, new highways were built. The number of drive-ins  increased immediately. Drive-ins became part of the social life in America by the end of 1940.
