To calculate a person's Average Indexed Monthly salary (AIME) earnings, the records of their covered salaries may be obtained from the Social Security Administration by applying for them and paying a fee ranging from $15.00 for one year's covered wages to $80.00 for 40 years of wages.[29] The adjusted wage indexes are available at Social Security's "Benefit Calculation Examples For Workers Retiring In 2013".[30]
