Miami Beach encounters tidal flooding of certain roads during the annual king tides,[50] though some tidal flooding has been the case for decades,[51] as the parts of the western side of South Beach[52] are at virtually 0 feet (0 m) above normal high tide,[53] with the entire city averaging only 4.4 feet (1.3 m) above mean sea level (AMSL).[54] However, a recent study by the University of Miami showed that tidal flooding became much more common from the mid 2000s.[55] The fall 2015 king tides exceeded expectations in longevity and height.[56] Traditional sea level rise and storm mitigation measures including sea walls and dykes, such as those in the Netherlands and New Orleans, may not work in South Florida due to the porous nature of the ground and limestone beneath the surface.[52]
