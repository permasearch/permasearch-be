Wilberforce was a small, sickly and delicate child with poor eyesight.[9] In 1767, he began attending Hull Grammar School,[10] at the time headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, Joseph Milner, who was to become a lifelong friend.[11] Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school, until the death of his father in 1768 caused changes in his living arrangements. With his mother struggling to cope, the nine-year-old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James' Place, London, and Wimbledon, at that time a village 7 miles (11Â km) south-west of London. He attended an "indifferent" boarding school in Putney for two years. He spent his holidays in Wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives.[12] He became interested in evangelical Christianity due to his relatives' influence, especially that of his aunt Hannah, sister of the wealthy Christian merchant John Thornton, a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading Methodist preacher George Whitefield.[1]
