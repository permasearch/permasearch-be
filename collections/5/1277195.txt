Prescott followed in the footsteps of his older brother Benjamin and apprenticed under his father, Abel Prescott, for about seven years.  He appears to have kept an extremely low profile during pre-revolutionary times as well as afterward, as best can be attained.  He did open a practice in Concord, just before or after which time he began to court Lydia Mulliken, daughter of a well-respected Lexington clockmaker who had died in 1767.[5]
