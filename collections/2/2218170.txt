Multiple switches may be utilized to optimize for maximum throughput in a multiple network switch topology,[10] when the switches are configured in parallel as part of an isolated network between two or more systems. In this configuration, the switches are isolated from one another. One reason to employ a topology such as this is for an isolated network with many hosts (a cluster configured for high performance, for example), using multiple smaller switches can be more cost effective than a single larger switch. If access beyond the network is required, an individual host can be equipped with an additional network device connected to an external network; this host then additionally acts as a gateway. The network interfaces 1 through 3 of computer cluster node A, for example, are connected via separate network switches 1 through 3 with network interfaces 1 through 3 of computer cluster node B; there are no inter-connections between the network switches 1 through 3. The linux bonding driver mode typically employed in configurations of this type is balance-rr; the balance-rr mode allows individual connections between two hosts to effectively utilize greater than one interface's bandwidth.
