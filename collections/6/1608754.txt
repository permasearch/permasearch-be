The next match was a standard wrestling match between Kane and Chris Jericho. Jericho controlled the earlier part of the match by using his quickness against Kane's power but Kane eventually controlled his high-flying with his high-impact power moves. The action went back and forth as both men countered each other and battled each other's quickness and power. Kane eventually tried to perform a  Tombstone Piledriver, but Jericho used his quickness by pushing Kane into the exposed corner of the ring. Kane's face was slammed into the steel pole and Jericho got a near-fall. Jericho then applied the Walls of Jericho, until Kane broke the hold. Jericho performed a Bulldog and tried to perform a Springboard Moonsault, which he called Lionsault. However, Kane grabbed the flying Jericho by neck and performed a Chokeslam to win the match.[2][3][4]
