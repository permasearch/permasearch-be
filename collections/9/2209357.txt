The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition, when the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé, considered by some the best club team of all time, earned worldwide admiration.[8] Os Santásticos, also known as O Balé Branco (the white ballet) won the title in 1962 defeating defending champions Peñarol in the finals.[9] A year later, O Rei and his compatriot Coutinho demonstrated their skills again in the form of tricks, dribbles, backheels, and goals including two in the second leg of the final at La Bombonera, to subdue Boca Juniors 2–1 and retain the trophy.[9][10]
