The album starts out with one of the rare times you hear of Bert taking a bath. As he does so, he is heard singing "Yankee Doodle." Eventually Ernie comes in and pushes their piano into the bathroom and decides to join in, much to Bert's dismay. He starts playing music, which accompanies Bert singing in protest of the whole thing ("I Refuse To Sing Along"), with Ernie, in counterpoint, trying to persuade him to sing along.
