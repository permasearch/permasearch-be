As von Trier's first film made after his founding of the Dogme 95 movement, it is heavily influenced by the movement's style and ethos, although the movie breaks several of the rules laid out by the movement's manifesto. Breaking the Waves has been described as "perhaps von Trier's most widely acclaimed film", and has won numerous awards including the Grand Prix at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.[4]
