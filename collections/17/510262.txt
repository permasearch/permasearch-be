The details of the legislation itself was largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture.[168] As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built.[169] Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around 100 feet (30Â m), after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below.[170] On a quarter of the site, however, the owner could build as high as they wished, without any further restrictions.[170]
