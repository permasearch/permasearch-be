The arcuate nucleus and the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have dopamine neurons that form an important projectionâ€”the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin.[36] Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland.[36] Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland.[36] The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, in the absence of dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion.[36] In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.[36]
