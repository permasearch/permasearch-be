Boron fibers (boron filaments) are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods.[78][79] The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.[80][81]
