Creoles are languages with a vocabulary heavily based on a superstrate language but a grammar based on substrate languages and/or universal language tendencies.  Some Creoles model a future tense/irrealis mood marker on "go" from the superstrate (analogous to English "am going to").[18]:p. 188  In many creoles the future can be indicated with the progressive aspect, analogous to the English "I'm seeing him tomorrow."[18]:p. 190  In general creoles tend to put less emphasis on marking tense than on marking aspect.  When any of tense, aspect, and modality are specified, they are typically indicated with invariant pre-verbal markers in the sequence anterior relative tense (prior to the time focused on), irrealis mode (conditional or future), imperfective aspect.[18]:pp. 176â€“9, p. 191
