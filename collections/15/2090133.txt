Mrs. Exposition is Basil's extremely frail and elderly British mother of 92 years.[15] In the first movie, she makes a brief appearance when she comes in from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, where Basil introduces Austin to her.[15] Austin, however, thinks she is a man in disguise (referencing an earlier scene), punching her in the face; after being scolded for his actions, Austin tries to clarify that she looked like a man and that she had been beaten with "an ugly stick."[15]
