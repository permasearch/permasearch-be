In the early 21st century, historian Robert L. Scheina estimated that the slave rebellion resulted in the death of 350,000 Haitians and 50,000 European troops.[92] According to the Encyclopedia of African American Politics, "Between 1791 and independence in 1804 nearly 200,000 blacks died, as did thousands of mulattoes and as many as 100,000 French and British soldiers."[93] Yellow fever caused the most deaths. Geggus points out that at least 3 of every 5 British troops sent there in 1791â€“97 died of disease.[94][95] There has been considerable debate over whether the number of deaths caused by disease was exaggerated.[96]
