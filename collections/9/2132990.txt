When Norma Shearer declined the role of Constance, Bette Davis was offered the part in October 1960, but she had to turn it down due to commitments to Broadway.[14] At one point in late 1960, Gene Tierney and Lee Remick were cast in the starring roles, but it was reported in November 1960 that both withdrew due to pregnancy.[15]
