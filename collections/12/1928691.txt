Antarctica consists of three main geographic regions: the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, and East Antarctica. In West Antarctica, which has warmed 0.17 °C per decade at the same time that global warming was 0.13 °C per decade, ice loss has increased by 59% in the early 21st century to about 132 billion metric tons per year.[43] The yearly loss along the Antarctic Peninsula has increased by 140% to 60 billion metric tons. The East Antarctic ice sheet, by far the largest region of the continent, has an ice budget that is overall stable to slightly melting. It is experiencing melting along the coastal margin in warming seas and snow accumulation in the hinterlands. Overall the entire continent of Antarctica is experiencing net melting.[10] All three regions of Antarctica are warming (Figure 4) and overall ice loss in Antarctica increased by 75% in the past 10 years.
