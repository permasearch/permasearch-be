Following Kaysar's eviction, HouseGuests competed in "The Ghost of Big Brother Past" Head of Household competition.[38] For this competition, HouseGuests were asked questions based on a seance the group had held earlier in the week. HouseGuests attempted to answer the true or false questions without being the last one to buzz in; being the last to buzz in would result in a HouseGuests elimination. Erika was the winner of the competition.[96][97] Following the Head of Household competition, the HouseGuests learned that a new special power could impact the game, and that the first HouseGuest to correctly guess a secret phrase would be the winner.[98] To solve the phrase, they were given their first hint, which was a sheep.[99] Following numerous complaints of equipment malfunctions, it was decided that a new competition would be held.[100] That night, HouseGuests competed in a new version of the competition, in which they answered using a movable block; Janelle became the new Head of Household for the third time this season.[101][102] On Day 40, HouseGuests competed in the "Big Brother Bakery" food competition.[38] For this competition, HouseGuests had to make a three course meal out of slop and serve it to the three judges of the competition. The judges were later revealed to be former Big Brother HouseGuests Nicole Schaffrich, Jun Song, and Marvin Latimer. The HouseGuests earned food for everyday of the week excluding Wednesday, as well as a barbecue. Later that day, Janelle chose to nominate Danielle and Erika for eviction.[103][104] HouseGuests were later given their second clue for the secret power, which was an over-sized thread and needle.[105] When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Will, Marcellas, and James were selected to play; Janelle was not able to compete as she had given up the right to play in the previous Power of Veto competition. On Day 41, HouseGuests competed in the "Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Veto" Power of Veto competition.[38] For this competition, the competing HouseGuests participated in competitions taken from previous seasons. Former HouseGuest Nicole hosted the competition, while fellow former HouseGuests April Lewis, Jack Owens, Hardy Ames-Hill, and Scott Long returned to participate in the competitions.[106] The competing HouseGuests wagered how quickly they could perform a task, and failure to do so resulted in their elimination. Danielle was the winner of the Power of Veto.[107] On Day 43, Danielle chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Marcellas being nominated in her place.[108] HouseGuests were later given the third and final clue, which was a figure of a Grim Reaper entering the house. It was later revealed that Mike had won the Coup d'Ã‰tat, which he could use at any of the next three evictions.[109] He could overthrow the HoH, and nominate two of his own HouseGuests for eviction; the HoH and PoV winner could not be nominated.[110] On Day 46, Marcellas became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.[111][112][113] He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.
