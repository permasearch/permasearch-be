Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling.[7] Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling.[7][17] A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep.[7] An extreme example of automatic trichotillomania is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep.[7] This is called sleep-isolated trichotillomania.[18]
