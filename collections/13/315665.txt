Montreal's theatre district ("Quartier des Spectacles") is the scene of performances that are mainly French-language, although the city also boasts a lively anglophone theatre scene, such as the Centaur Theatre.[118] Large French theatres in the city include Theatre Saint-Denis, Theatre du Nouveau Monde, and EXcentris.[119]
