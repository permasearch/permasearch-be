The Minneapolis Miracle was the final play of the 2017/18 Divisional Round game against the New Orleans Saints.[100] The Vikings were trailing by one point and needed a field goal or touchdown to secure a trip to the NFC Championship Game. With less than ten seconds remaining in the game quarterback Case Keenum lobbed the ball to wide receiver Stefon Diggs, which became the game-winning touchdown. This also happens to be the very first walk-off victory in NFL playoff history.[101] On KFAN 100.3, radio announcer, Paul Allen dubbed the play the 'Minneapolis Miracle'.[102] They would go on to the NFC Championship for the opportunity to be playing in the Super Bowl within their own stadium. This would end up not happening as the Vikings would lose to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 38-7.
