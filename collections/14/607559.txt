Red wolves primarily live in packs composed of a socially monogamous breeding pair and offspring of different ages.  Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare.[27]  A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation.[27]
