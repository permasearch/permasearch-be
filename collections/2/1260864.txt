Milian is a light-lyric soprano[144] who has not displayed her voice all the way in terms of upper register. She has only showcased a full voice vocal range from Eb3 to F5.[145] The tessitura and tone of her voice are naturally light in their quality but she has shown in her belts that she can create strong tones. Her vocal style has been compared to Paula Abdul.[146] David Peisner of Maxim commented on her talent and described her voice as being "silky and sassy." Earlier in her career, Milian was mainly an urban pop and teen pop singer but as she matured and grew her sound later grew to branch out into a more hip-hop soul and straight forward R&B sound on her later two releases It's About Time and So Amazin'.[147][148]
