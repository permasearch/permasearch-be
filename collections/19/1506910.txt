In a less enthusiastic review for The Guardian, Kitty Empire was critical of West's lyrics regarding "women as ruthless money-grabbers" on an otherwise "herculean" and "flawed near-masterpiece".[124] AllMusic's Andy Kellman found his rapping inconsistent on what was nonetheless "a deeply fascinating accomplishment" in West's catalogue: "As fatiguing as it is invigorating, as cold-blooded as it is heart-rending, as haphazardly splattered as it is meticulously sculpted, [the album] is an extraordinarily complex 70-minute set of songs ... As the ego and ambition swells, so does the appeal, the repulsiveness, and – most importantly – the ingenuity".[39]
