In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.[12] Comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s, resulting in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns; such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes, reduced the population of the City of Glasgow council area to an estimated 615,070, with 1,209,143 people living in the Greater Glasgow urban area.[13][5] The wider metropolitan area is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[14] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2
