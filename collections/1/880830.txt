In 2007, on the ABC-TV quiz show Spicks and Specks the question was posed "What children's song is contained in the song Down Under?" The answer, "Kookaburra", a song whose rights were owned by Larrikin Music, resulted in phone calls and emails to Larrikin the next day.[16] Larrikin Music subsequently decided to take legal action against the song's writers Colin Hay and Ron Strykert.
