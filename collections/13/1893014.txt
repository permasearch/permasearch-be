Shivraj starts his wedding celebrations with Chanda, only to be interrupted by the still alive Rajkumar, who is shown to have been rescued by one of Shivraj's henchmen after he was buried. Shivraj's men back off, because they are now friends with Rajkumar, hence leading to a one on one fight between the two. Finally, Rajkumar kills Shivraj with a power punch to the neck and later kills Don Takka with a ceramic tile. The film ends with all the men beating Parmar, while a severely injured Rajkumar and Chanda walk away hand in hand happily.
