Historians have no literature and no original Etruscan texts of religion or philosophy; therefore, much of what is known about this civilization derives from grave goods and tomb findings.[21] An mtDNA study in 2007 suggested that the Etruscans were not related substantially to the Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherer populations of Europe and that they showed no similarities to populations in the Near East.[citation needed] An earlier DNA study performed in Italy, however, partly gave credence to the theory of Herodotus, as the results showed that 11 minor mitochondrial DNA lineages extracted from different Etruscan remains occur nowhere else in Europe and are shared only with Near Eastern samples.[22]
