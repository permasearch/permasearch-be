A number of religious traditions exist in the favelas. Historically, Catholicism was the most prominent religion of the area, but over the past few decades there has been a shift toward Evangelicalism, including Pentecostalism.[16] While there has been an increase in the number of converts to Evangelicalism, there are also an increasing number of people who claim to be non-religious.[20]
