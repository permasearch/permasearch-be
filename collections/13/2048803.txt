In March 2015, Slate noted Taylor in an article discussing "Several actors who are openly gay or who have been cast in multiple gay or bisexual roles and the typecasting of gay roles". Taylor, himself, added: "I feel like the landscape has totally changed. Regardless of sexual preference, it's more that as a character actor, the less I reveal about myself, the better. My favorite actors are the ones I know least about." [16] In April 2015, Taylor openly identified as gay on episode 672 of the Nerdist podcast with Chris Hardwick.[17][18]
