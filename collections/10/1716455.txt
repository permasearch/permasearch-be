Jersey law has been influenced by several different legal traditions, in particular Norman customary law, English common law and modern French civil law.[54] Jersey's legal system is therefore described as 'mixed' or 'pluralistic', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main working language of the legal system is English.
