From around 37,000 years ago, all ancient Europeans began to share some ancestry with modern Europeans.[38] This founding population is represented by GoyetQ116-1, a 35,000 year old specimen from Belgium.[38] This lineage disappears from the record and is not found again until 19,000 BP in Spain at El Mirón, which shows strong affinities to GoyetQ116-1.[38] During this interval, the distinct Věstonice Cluster is predominant in Europe, even at Goyet.[38] The re-expansion of the El Mirón Cluster coincided with warming temperatures following the retreat of the glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum.[38] From 37,000 to 14,000 years ago, the population of Europe consisted of an isolated population descended from a founding population that didn't interbreed significantly with other populations.[39]
