Evans appeared on other daytime soap operas between her stints at Days of Our Lives. In September 1993, she began playing the villainous Katherine Bell on General Hospital (and later on Port Charles) until October 1999. Evans moved to New York City to play Sierra Estaban on As the World Turns from December 2000 to late 2005, later reprising the role from July 2010 until the show's finale on September 17, 2010.[4] In 2005, One Life to Live almost signed her on contract for the role of Dr. Paige Miller, but Evans backed out at the last moment and the role was filled with Kimberlin Brown.[5]
