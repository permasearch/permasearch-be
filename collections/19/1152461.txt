The Grammy Award-winning[31] score for the film was composed by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90, a choir of 46, "and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion".[32] The film's producer Dean Devlin commented that "you can leave it up to a Brit to write some of the most rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema."[32] The soundtrack has received two official CD releases. RCA released a 50-minute album at the time of the film's release, then in 2010, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition, two-disc CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues.[33] The premiere of Independence Day live[34] took place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016, with the film's score was performed live to a screening of the film.[35] This celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, and the event also featured a pre-film talk by David Arnold.
