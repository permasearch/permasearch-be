In 1999, Blunt volunteered to join a Blues and Royals squadron deploying with NATO to Kosovo.[18] Initially assigned to carry out reconnaissance of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedoniaâ€“Yugoslavia border, Blunt's troop worked ahead of the front lines locating and targeting Serb forces for the NATO bombing campaign. On 12 June 1999, the troop led the 30,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force from the Macedonia border towards Pristina International Airport. However, a Russian military contingent had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. American NATO commander Wesley Clark ordered that the unit forcibly take the airport from the Russians. General Mike Jackson, the British commander, refused the order, stating that they were "not going to start the Third World War".[19][20] Blunt has said that he would have refused to obey such an order.
