Meteorites contain a record of accretion and impacts during all stages of asteroid origin and evolution; however, the mechanism of asteroid accretion and growth is not well understood.[29] Evidence suggests the main growth of asteroids can result from gas-assisted accretion of chondrules, which are millimeter-sized spherules that form as molten (or partially molten) droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids.[29] In the inner Solar System, chondrules appear to have been crucial for initiating accretion.[30] The tiny mass of asteroids may be partly due to inefficient chondrule formation beyond 2 AU, or less-efficient delivery of chondrules from near the protostar.[30] Also, impacts controlled the formation and destruction of asteroids, and are thought to be a major factor in their geological evolution.[30]
