While at first shocking to fans and media, Oklahoma State immediately pledged transparency. Athletic Director Mike Holder held a press conference the day before the release and apologized for the bad publicity, and promised to investigate the claims. OSU then hired independent investigator, Charles Smrt to conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations. ESPN later debunked several of the claims in the story by simply calling OSU's registrar and obtaining a transcript from Tatum Bell that proved he was not in school during stated timelines. Further controversy began to surround the Sports Illustrated article when Jason Whitlock, a former colleague of Evans, claimed that he was a huge fan of the University of Oklahoma.[23] Dohrmann went on national syndicated radio with Doug Gottlieb and stated that Fath' Carter had two degrees from OSU.[24] When questioned by ESPN's Brett McMurphy, the registrars' office later stated that Fath' Carter had never graduated.[25] Brandon Weeden also was able to point to unprofessional behavior from Evans displayed during a press conference.[26] DeadSpin also found out that many crucial professors and tutors never were interviewed for the story.[27]
