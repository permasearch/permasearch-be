Petra's use for the movie's climactic scenes greatly contributed to its popularity as an international tourist destination. Before the film's release, only a few thousand visitors per year made the trip; since then it has grown to almost a million annually.[60] Shops and hotels near the site play up the connection, and it is mentioned prominently in itineraries of locations used in the film series.[61] Jordan's tourism board mentions the connection on its website.[62] In 2012 the satirical news site The Pan-Arabia Enquirer ran a mock story claiming that the board had officially renamed Petra "That Place from Indiana Jones" to reflect how the world more commonly refers to it.[63]
