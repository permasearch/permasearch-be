Measles is extremely contagious and its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities which generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized in measles by Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the critical community size (CCS).[1] Analysis of outbreaks in island communities suggested that the CCS for measles is c. 250,000.[2]
