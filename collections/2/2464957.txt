On 18 November 1302, Pope Boniface VIII issued the papal bull Unam sanctam[a] which some historians[1] consider one of the most extreme statements of papal spiritual supremacy ever made.[not in citation given (See discussion.)] The original document is lost but a version of the text can be found in the registers of Boniface VIII in the Vatican Archives.[2] The Bull lays down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation, the position of the pope as supreme head of the Church, and the duty thence arising of submission to the pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The pope further emphasizes the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order.
