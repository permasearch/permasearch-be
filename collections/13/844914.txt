Frank Sinatra agreed to do a cameo at the suggestion of Davis and Martin. Needham wrote three versions of the script for him - one where he could work a week, another where he did two days, and one where he could do his scene in a day. He picked the latter. He was paid $30,000 which he donated to charity.[1] It was the first film he had made in three years and the first time he had reunited with Rat Pack members professionally or personally in three years. Needham says he turned up half an hour early and did his scene with minimal fuss.[3]
