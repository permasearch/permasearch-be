The time that the student skips may create a knowledge gap if the child has not self-studied the material already taught to the students in the grade being entered.[1] While the student is bridging this gap they will likely find the new material challenging. It may be demoralizing to leave a situation in which they are top performers into a situation where they are struggling with the material. Knowledge gaps are smaller in earlier school years. Students almost always successfully catch up to match their peers.[2]
