Pixies also make an appearance in the cartoon TV series Winx Club. In this version, it seems that almost all pixies are females, and while they do use their magic as a carrier based on their talents (Examples: Chatta for Gossip, Lockette for Portals, Amore for True Love, Tune for Good Manners, Digit for Nano-tech, and Piff for Sweet Dreams), these pixies are more colourful, more fun-loving, and more voice-variant in spite of having the same toddler-like, high-pitched accent from their natural toy-like size. Also, the Winx Club pixies are friends with fairies. In fact, each pixie bonds at first sight with her fairy of fate (like "soul mates" or "twin sisters") and helps her any way their talent would allow and that fairy, in turn, protects her pixie.
