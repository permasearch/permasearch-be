Basketball is popular in Australia in terms of participation, especially among children.[143] The National Basketball League (NBL) began in 1979 and is contested by eight teamsâ€”seven from Australia and one from New Zealand.[144] The Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) is the top women's basketball league, having begun in 1981, and the national women's team (the Opals) has won medals at the Olympics since 1994. Netball has the highest participation rate of any women's sport in Australia. Established in 2008, the ANZ Championship is the premier netball league in Australia and New Zealand, featuring five teams from each country. The Australian national netball team (the Diamonds) is considered the best in the world, having won 10 of 13 World Netball Championships.
