On March 6, 2014, Sony announced that Screen Gems will distribute a film adaptation of The Last of Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi.[163] By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors.[164] Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell.[165] In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann.[166] Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role.[167]
