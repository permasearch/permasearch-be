Buoyed by the recent successes and out of contract at WEA, EBTG released the self-produced "Walking Wounded" in 1996 exclusively licensed to Atlantic Records for the United States and Canada and  Virgin Records for the Rest of the World. Featuring collaborations with Spring Heel Jack and Howie B it ushered in a new electronic sound for their own work. It charted at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned two top ten UK Top 40 singles - "Walking Wounded" and "Wrong". Two further singles - "Single" and "Before Today" - reached number 20 and number 25 respectively.[5]
