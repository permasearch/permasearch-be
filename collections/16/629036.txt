This season, PAGASA will use its own naming scheme for cyclones, that will either develop within or move into their self-defined area of responsibility.[186] The names were taken from a list of names, that was last used during 2013 and are scheduled to be used again during 2021.[186] All of the names are the same except for Lannie, Salome and Yasmin, which replaced the names Labuyo, Santi and Yolanda after they were retired.[186] The names Lannie and Salome were used for the first time this year.
