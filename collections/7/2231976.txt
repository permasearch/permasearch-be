Scholars believe that the Song of the Sea was compiled and passed orally before it was quoted in the Book of Exodus and that it is among the most ancient poems in the history of literature, perhaps going back to the 2nd millennium BCE.[12][13] The Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5) were written in Archaic Biblical Hebrew, also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew (10th â€” 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the Babylonian Exile).
