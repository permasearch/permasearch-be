Sports mouthguards (also termed athletic mouthpieces) are plastic dental appliances which can help to protect the hard and soft tissues of the mouth from damage caused by traumatic blows and collisions. They are also designed to absorb the shock of impact to the head reducing the incidence of concussions (though this may not be very effective with the generic boil-and-bite mouth guards). Mouth guards are simple half-moons of plastic with a strap on the end which hooks around the face mask so it is not lost during play. Fitting a mouth guard is simple: it is placed in boiling water, allowing the plastic to soften. It is removed from the boiling water, and then placed for a second in cold water. The cold water dip cools the exterior of the plastic (so that it will not burn the mouth), while leaving the interior of the plastic soft (so that it can be formed). Then the player puts the mouth piece in his mouth and bites down, leaving an imprint of his teeth and gums. As the plastic cools, the mold hardens. The result is a mouth guard specific to one player's mouth.
