The album was released in three separate edits: a "dirty edit" comprising the full film versions, a "clean edit" with re-recorded vocals replacing foul language with non-sense words, and a limited edition[clarification needed]. All three versions contain clips from the movie, but some dialogue was re-recorded for the clean version. The special limited edition was released in a cardboard "old book case", which includes a digipack version of the album, a foldout poster depicting the D and Sasquatch, eight tarot cards from the film (Tenacious D, The Training, Destiny, Masterpiece, The Quest, The Divide, and Two Kings, as well as a card explaining the other cards), and a plastic replica of the Pick of Destiny. If the set was pre-ordered from the Tenacious D website, it also included a T-shirt.
