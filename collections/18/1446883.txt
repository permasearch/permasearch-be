B. B. Lal used the same approach with a more conservative assumption of the average reign to estimate a date of 836Â BCE, and correlated this with archaeological evidence from Painted Grey Ware (PGW) sites, the association being strong between PGW artifacts and places mentioned in the epic.[37] John Keay confirm this and also gives 950 BCE for the Bharata battle.[38]
