After marrying Jordan, they learnt that he was Cabot's biological father. The latter demanded a role in his son's life which unsettled Rosanna but she agreed. They also learnt that James Stenbeck had been instrumental in bringing them together and it was revealed that Stenbeck was Jordan's biological father. Realizing that this was his way of insinuating himself into their lives, Rosanna ran away with Cabot but was brought back by Jordan. Later, Stenbeck became increasingly diabolical when he demanded that Rosanna and Jordan consummate their marriage, which the latter refused to since he was in love with Jennifer Munson and Rosanna with Paul Ryan. His father retaliated by kidnapping both his wife and son and trapped them in a burning building. Though Paul managed to save Rosanna, Cabot seemingly died in the fire. Inconsolable with grief, Rosanna broke all ties with him and found comfort in Jordan's arms which effectively killed his relationship with Jennifer. Jordan soon left town after annulling their marriage. Rosanna then temporarily moved in with Emma Snyder to deal with her pain. She eventually forgave Paul and they later married.
