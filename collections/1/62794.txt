The first motion pictures were photographed using a simple homogeneous photographic emulsion that yielded a black-and-white imageâ€”that is, an image in shades of gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the luminous intensity of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.
