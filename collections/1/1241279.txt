The fashion industry is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.[117] In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive white, black and Asian women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction.[118] Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals,[119] and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the Eurocentric idea of beauty.
