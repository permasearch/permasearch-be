The desecration was not only carried out on Christian sites in and around Jerusalem. In campaigns of 1011 and 1013â€“14, Al-Hakim continued his campaign of destruction against Jewish synagogues and Torah scrolls along with churches all over Syria. Unlike other Fatimids, Al-Hakim launched persecutions against dhimmis that lasted throughout his reign.[4] Christians were made to wear crosses and Jews forced to wear wooden blocks around their necks.[5] He only stopped for fear of retaliatory attacks on Mosques in Christian lands.[6]
