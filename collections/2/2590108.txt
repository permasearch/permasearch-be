More than 80% of the state's silver was a byproduct of copper mining; other silver came as a byproduct of lead, zinc, and gold mining.[7] The most productive silver district in Arizona that was mined primarily for silver was Tombstone in Cochise County, discovered in 1877.[7] In 2006, all the silver mined in Arizona came as a byproduct of copper mining.
