After a brief deliberation, in which Kimmi was admonished by her former alliance, the castaways re-voted, with Spencer, Jeremy and Kelley immune. The second ballot was tied between Kimmi and Tasha. The four others told host Jeff Probst that they were not going to change their votes, thus the tie was deadlocked. Probst explained the rules: the four non-tied castaways had to unanimously decide to eliminate Kimmi or Tasha, or else the two tied would become immune; since Keith would then be the only one of the remaining four not immune, he would be eliminated by default. Jeremy and Spencer immediately said that they would not agree to eliminate Tasha, thus the only options were for Keith and Kelley to agree with them to eliminate Kimmi, or to disagree, which would eliminate Keith. Ultimately, Keith and Kelley chose the former, and Kimmi was eliminated.
