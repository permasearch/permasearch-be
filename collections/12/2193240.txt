However, the Bureau of Reclamation sponsored a six-state research program from 2002â€“2006, called the "Weather Damage Modification Program".[36] A 2003 study by the United States National Academy of Sciences urges a national research program to clear up remaining questions about weather modification's efficacy and practice.[37]
