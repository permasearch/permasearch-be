Sanders played a nine-year, part-time baseball career, playing left and center field in 641 games with 4 teams. He was originally drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 6th round of the 1985 draft, but did not sign with them. The New York Yankees selected Sanders in the 30th round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the team on June 22.[citation needed] He opened the 1989 season with the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League.[8] Though he planned to leave the Yankees in July to attend NFL training camp,[9] he became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Falcons, and used the Yankees as leverage. He received a promotion to the major leagues, and spent the summer with the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League.[10] He made his major league baseball debut on May 31, 1989.[11]
