The most important crops are wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 25,750,000 metric tons of wheat, more than all of Africa and nearly as much as all of South America, according to the USDA.[111] Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.[112]
