Overall, Ontario is a net exporter of electricity. Ontario imports electricity, primarily from its neighbouring provinces of Quebec and Manitoba (both of which are primarily hydroelectric systems), and exports electricity, primarily to Michigan and New York State,[80] which rely heavily on fossil fuelsâ€”coal in the case of Michigan,[86] and natural gas in the case of New York.[87]
