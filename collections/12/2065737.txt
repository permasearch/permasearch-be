Hát chầu văn or hát văn is a spiritual form of music used to invoke spirits during ceremonies.  It is highly rhythmic and trance-oriented.  Before 1986, the Vietnamese government repressed hát chầu văn and other forms of religious expression.  It has since been revived by musicians like Phạm Văn Tỵ.
