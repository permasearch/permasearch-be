"From This Moment On" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Matt Bjorke of About.com deemed the song as one of the album's highlights,[8] while Elizabeth Kessler of Yahoo! commented that "hardly any song can compare to this love anthem! ... Everyone feels their insides tug as they listen to this heart wrenching song."[9] Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for "From This Moment On". While reviewing the duet, Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White's vocals, "who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain seem a bit bland in comparison.  However, it also gives the song a bit of a mid-eighties Peter Cetera vibe, which hasnâ€™t held up well over time."[10] Coyne concluded, however, that the single release turned the track "into a potent solo number," and noted that "the addition of a Spanish-flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from 'Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman'  gave the ballad added oomph." He graded the single release at an A-.[10] At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards, "From This Moment On" won the award for Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year.[11]
