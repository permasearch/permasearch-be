In the narrative, at the time of King Benjamin (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called "the children of Christ".[68] At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of Captain Moroni (73 BC) were called "Christians" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.[69] The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas[70] the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.[71] Later, the prophet Mormon worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
