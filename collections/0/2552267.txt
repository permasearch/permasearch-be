In modern times, Muslims in India who convert to Christianity are often subjected to harassment, intimidation, and attacks by Muslims.[161][162] In Jammu and Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Muslim majority, a Christian convert and missionary named Bashir Tantray was killed, allegedly by militant Islamists in 2006.[163] However, there are cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith, secretly declaring his/her conversion. In effect, they are practising Christians, but legally Muslims; thus, the statistics of Indian Christians does not include Muslim converts to Christianity.
