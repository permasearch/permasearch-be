The block immediately to the north, on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, is occupied by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its western annex at 1250 Sixth Avenue.[219]:326 The 70-floor, 872-foot-tall (266Â m) building anchors the entire complex, and is located on the eastern side of the block.[221] Opened in 1933 as the RCA Building,[233] the building has been renamed multiple times, first to the GE Building in 1988, after General Electric bought RCA,[206] and then to the Comcast Building in 2014 after Comcast's purchase of NBC.[234][120] 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential.[235][236] It has three main segments: the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor,[219]:325 and, formerly, the Rockefeller family office;[120] a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses NBC Studios;[237] and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 Avenue of the Americas.[235] As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex,[238] with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels.[239][240]
