Christopher is born to Tom and Pippa as their first biological child. When Christopher is two years old, Tom dies of a heart attack. Pippa marries Michael Ross the following year and he adopts Christopher. As Christopher grows he forms a close bond with his foster siblings and his adoptive sister, Sally (Kate Ritchie). Christopher becomes friends with Duncan Stewart (Lewis Devaney) and they both get into scrapes together, including a situation where both explore a derelict building which is unstable following a recent earthquake. The house collapses and they are trapped but are eventually found. A year after Michael's death, Pippa meets Ian Routledge (Patrick Dickson) and he asks her to move away with him but she turns him down at first. Several months later Ian returns and Pippa and Christopher move away to the Carrington Ranges with him. In 2003, Christopher and Pippa return for Sally's wedding to local doctor Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy). Pippa briefly mentions to Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) that Christopher is gay. This causes problems with Nick Smith (Chris Egan), Irene's foster son, who thinks Chris is trying to make a move on him by acting kind toward him. Chris tries to kiss Seb Miller (Mitch Firth) and is left embarrassed and runs away. Seb later explains that it is okay for Chris to be who he was and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Chris, if Tom were around he would be proud of that Christopher would have the courage to be who he is. After resolving things, Chris returns home to Pippa and Ian.
