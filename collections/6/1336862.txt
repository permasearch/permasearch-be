In 2003, the album was ranked number 34 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[19] The laid-back feel of the album attracted the attention of other major artists. For example, Eric Clapton cites the album's roots rock style as what convinced him to quit Cream, and pursue the styles of Blind Faith, Delaney and Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos on his debut album. George Harrison was also impressed by the album's musicianship and sense of camaraderie, and Roger Waters called it the second "most influential record in the history of rock and roll", after Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and said that it "affected Pink Floyd deeply, deeply, deeply."[20] According to Terry Burrows, the album spawned the Americana genre,[21] while music academic Chris Smith said its songs laid the groundwork for roots rock music.[22]
