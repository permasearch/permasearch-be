In commercial nuclear fission reactors, the system is operated in the otherwise self-extinguishing prompt subcritical state. The reactor specific physical phenomena that nonetheless maintains the temperature above the decay heat level, are the predictably delayed,[5] and therefore easily controlled, transformations or movements of a vital class of fission product, or reaction ember, as they decay,[6] with Bromine-87 being one such long-lived "ember", with a half-life of about a minute and thus it emits a delayed neutron upon decay.[7]  Operating in this delayed critical state, the dependence on the inherently delayed transformation or movement of fission products/embers to maintain the temperature, is a process that occurs slow enough to permit human feedback on the temperature control. In an analogous manner to fire dampers varying the opening to control the movement of wood embers towards new fuel, control rods are comparatively varied up or down, as the nuclear fuel burns up over time.[8][9][10][11]
