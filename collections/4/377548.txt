A micro-operation cache (uop cache, Î¼op cache or UC)[30] is a specialized cache that stores micro-operations of decoded instructions, as received directly from the instruction decoders or from the instruction cache. When an instruction needs to be decoded, the uop cache is checked for its decoded form which is re-used if cached; if it is not available, the instruction is decoded and then cached.
