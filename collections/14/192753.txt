By the 6th century, the lateen sail had largely replaced the square sail throughout the Mediterranean, the latter almost disappearing from Mediterranean iconography until the mid-13th century.[22] It became the standard rig of the Byzantine dromon war galley and was probably also employed by Belisarius' flagship in the 532Â AD invasion of the Vandal kingdom.[17][23] After the Muslim conquests in Syria, Egypt and North Africa, they adopted the lateen sail by way of the Coptic populace, which shared the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition and continued to provide the bulk of galley crews for centuries to come.[24] This is also indicated by the terminology of the lateen among Mediterranean Arabs, which is derived from Greco-Roman nomenclature.[25]
