The Project Mathematics! series of videos is a teaching aid for teachers to help students understand the basics of geometry and trigonometry. The series was developed by Tom M. Apostol and James F. Blinn, both from the California Institute of Technology. Apostol led the production of the series, while Blinn provided the computer animation used to depict the ideas beings discussed. Blinn mentioned that part of his inspiration was the Bell science series of films from the 1950s.[2]
