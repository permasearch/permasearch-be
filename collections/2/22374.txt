Christina Ross returns to the Ross house, but gets upset and jealous when the children want to do activities with Jessie more than her. Christina books an acting gig for Jessie in an attempt to spend more time with the children. However, the children secretly fly to Hollywood to see Jessie on set and seek her help, as they believe their mother would not be able to spend any time with them and help out. The children sneak onto the H of the Hollywood sign to view Jessie on set, but the giant letter begins to tip over when Luke and Ravi fight over a pair of binoculars. Jessie hears the children and uses some props to rescue them, but accidentally tips over the giant H afterward. Her actions lead her to star in a new television show about a superhero nanny. Jessie decides to leave the Ross family to star in this new show and Christina decides to become a stay-at-home mother so she can spend time with her children. The Ross family, including Bertram, then say their goodbyes to Jessie before she goes to Hollywood. As the series ends, Jessie runs into Tony, who had left his doorman job and moved to Hollywood himself to become a security guard for the film studio, and the Ross children followed her to Hollywood when they realized they still need her.
