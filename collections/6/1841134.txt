The last movement has a playful mood and is light in texture, however the articulation is marked carefully and precisely to maintain clarity, as was common of the time. It is not in sonata form, like the first movement, but a mix of a rondo and sonata form. The first theme is followed by a number of scale passages and a short series of arpeggios. The same material is used for the rest of the piece, although there are some differences towards the end. There is little harmonic exploration, but there is occasional modulation throughout the piece.[6]
