Ronaldinho made his team debut in a friendly against Juventus at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts on 27 July, with coach Rijkaard stating post match, “He has something special every time he touches the ball.”[35] He scored his first competitive goal in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla at 1.30 a.m. local time, in a match that kicked off at five minutes past midnight.[36] After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran through midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net.[36] Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign,[37] and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season. Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003–04 season, helping the team ultimately finish second in the league.[38][39] His scooped pass set up the winning goal for Xavi away to Real Madrid on 25 April 2004, the club’s first win at the Bernabéu in seven years, a result that Xavi credits as the start of “the Barcelona rise.”[40]
