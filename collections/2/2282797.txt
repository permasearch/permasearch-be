Ed (エド, Edo) is a character who makes his playable debut in Street Fighter V. He first appears as a child in Street Fighter IV during Balrog's ending, created as a potential replacement body for Bison before being stolen by S.I.N. He is found and freed by Balrog, who believes Ed's ability to channel Psycho Power like Bison could be useful. He is featured in Street Fighter V: A Shadow Falls, having undergone accelerated aging and working alongside Balrog for Shadaloo. He later joined the playable roster during the game's second season of content, now a grown adult.[64] His gameplay can be considered a mixture between Balrog and M.Bison, as he has the boxing prowess of the former and psychokinetic powers of the latter.
