Recreational drugs include alcohol (as found in beer, wine, and distilled spirits); cannabis and hashish; nicotine (tobacco); caffeine (coffee and black tea); and the controlled substances (illegal drugs) as listed in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of the United Nations. T The substances classified as controlled and illegal drugs vary by country, but they usually include methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine and other street drugs and club drugs. In 2009 it was estimated that about 3% to 6% of people aged 15 to 65 had used illegal drugs at least once (149 to 270 million).[1]
