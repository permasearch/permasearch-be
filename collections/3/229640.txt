On the phone with Jan, Michael compares the performance of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin to the biblical story of David and Goliath. He later tells her that she's the "Eva Peron to his Cesar Chavez".[12] He later answers a phone from her by saying "Jan Levinson, I presume", a reference to the quote "Dr. Livingstone, I Presume", supposedly said by Henry Morton Stanley to David Livingstone after the former met the latter on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in 1871.[12] Michael reasons that the money from the casino night should benefit the Boy Scouts of America because "They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts!"[12] He later states that he will donate all of his charity winnings to Comic Relief, a British charity. Kelly reasons that she would donate her winnings to Kobe Bryant's foundation, only because he bought his wife a large ring.[12]
