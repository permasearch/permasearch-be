The band They Might Be Giants recorded an alternative rock version of the song for the 2004 compilation album Future Soundtrack for America, using a three verse lyric as adapted by Oscar Brand (from the first, eighth and second verses in Ross's original). Appropriately enough, the compilation was a benefit album for political causes relating to that year's election. John Flansburgh of They Might be Giants has remarked on the song's historical success as "the 'Rock Around the Clock' of campaign songs"[7] and "the 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' of campaign songs."[8]
