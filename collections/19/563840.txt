Antennas are required by any radio receiver or transmitter to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which carry signals through the air (or through space) at the speed of light with almost no transmission loss. Radio transmitters and receivers are used to convey signals in broadcast (audio) radio, television, mobile telephones, Wi-Fi (WLAN) data networks, and remote control devices among many others. Radio waves are also used directly for measurements in radar, GPS, and radio astronomy. Transmitters and receivers require antennas, although these are sometimes hidden (such as the antenna inside an AM radio or inside a laptop computer equipped with Wi-Fi).
