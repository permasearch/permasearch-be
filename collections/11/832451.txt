On 22 May 2016, Kane opened a 2â€“1 friendly win over Turkey at the City of Manchester Stadium, but later missed a penalty. He was the first England player to fail to score from the penalty spot during a game since Frank Lampard in 2010, and the first to miss the target since Peter Crouch in 2006.[150] At the European Championship in France that June, Kane was assigned to take corner kicks, a tactic which was criticised by pundits,[151] but defended by Hodgson, who said that Kane was the best for the role.[152]
