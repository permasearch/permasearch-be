Abracadabra is of unknown origin, and its first occurrence is in the second century works of Serenus Sammonicus, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.[1] Several folk etymologies are associated with the word:[2] from phrases in Hebrew that mean "I will create as I speak",[3] or Aramaic "I create like the word",[4] to folk etymologies that point to similar words in Latin and Greek such as abraxas.[5] According to the OED Online, "no documentation has been found to support any of the various conjectures."[5]
