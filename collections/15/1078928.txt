By the time the song was finished, Harley and the band felt confident the song was a hit single. He recalled: "We certainly smelled something cooking that was very special. We had a huge chorus on there. Once they'd [the backing vocalists] had done their bit I came up with The Beatles bit - 'Ooh-la-la-la' - kind of from their "Rubber Soul" period. I made the song really hooky because the lyrics are quite dark and cynical, frankly."[17]
