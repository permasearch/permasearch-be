Salinity (/seɪˈlɪnəti/) is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water (see also soil salinity). This is usually measured in        g     salt     k g     sea       water        {\displaystyle {\frac {g\ {\textrm {salt}}}{kg\ {\textrm {sea}}\ {\textrm {water}}}}}   (note that this is technically dimensionless). Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water.
