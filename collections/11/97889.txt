In the Bible's version of events, the period from the conquest of Canaan under the leadership of Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel, passed with the tribes forming a loose confederation, described in the Book of Judges. Modern scholarship has called into question the beginning, middle, and end of this picture[3][4] and the account of the conquest under Joshua has largely been abandoned.[5][6][7] The Bible's depiction of the 'period of the Judges' is widely considered doubtful.[3][8][9] The extent to which a united Kingdom of Israel ever existed is also a matter of ongoing dispute.[10][11][12]
