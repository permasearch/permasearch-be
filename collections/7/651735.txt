Last Light is powered by 4A Games' own in-house engine, 4A Engine.[32] Beynon claimed that with the engine it was the best looking game currently available on the market, especially for personal computers.[33] The team also worked to improve the game's lighting and destruction system and introduced a larger variety of color palette.[34] The game was originally set to be released for Nintendo's Wii U, and the title was included in the Wii U show-reel, though THQ has since stated that the game may not be released for that platform.[35] Regarding the possibility of the game coming to the Wii U, 4A Games chief technical officer Oles Shishkovtsov said the Wii U has a "horrible, slow CPU".[36] His colleague, Huw Beynon, reiterated the sentiment, telling NowGamer that there would not be a Wii U version of Metro: Last Light, because the studio "couldn't justify the effort required" and they "just figured it wasn't worth pursuing at this time".[36] According to THQ, 4A experimented with the Wii U development kit, but later gave up this version of the game during its early stages of development.[37]
