The British had an intelligence advantage: signals intelligence from Ultra and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position, force disposition and intentions. A reorganisation of the intelligence function in Africa in July had also improved the integration of intelligence received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.[16] With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.[17] By 25 October, Panzer Army fuel stocks were down to three days' supply, of which only two days' worth were east of Tobruk. "The Panzer Army...Â did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day".[18]
