For Westerners, there are a handful of private tour operators that help provide access to North Korea. There has been a recent incident where a 21-year-old American student named Otto Warmbier was arrested at the airport before departure, allegedly for removing a propaganda poster from a wall in his hotel. Otto was at the time traveling with Chinese tour operator Young Pioneer Tours for a 5-day tourist trip to North Korea. He was convicted of "committing hostile acts" against the state (after allegedly stealing a propaganda poster from the restricted floor of his hotel) and sentenced to 15 years hard labor.[10] He was later released and returned for humanitarian reasons but was in a coma which led to his death on 19 June 2017.[11] As a result the tour group stated that they would stop taking United States citizens to North Korea as the "risk is too high". Koryo Tours (known for its North Korean-related films such as Comrade Kim Goes Flying and strong history in the region) are also looking into their positions on the matter.[12] It is unknown how this will affect tourism from other western countries.
