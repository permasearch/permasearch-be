These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline. These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.[6]
