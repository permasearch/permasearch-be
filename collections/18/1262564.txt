Logic began independently in ancient India and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.[5] Medhatithi Gautama (c. 7th century BC) founded the anviksiki school of logic.[6] The Mahabharata (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the anviksiki and tarka schools of logic. Pāṇini (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350-283 BC) in his Arthashastra as an independent field of inquiry.[7]
