Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[72] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.[73]
