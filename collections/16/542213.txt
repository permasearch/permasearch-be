The aristocrat Fujiwara no Shunzei was "the leading poet of [his] day"[85] and on a request from Emperor Go-Shirakawa compiled the Senzai Wakashū the seventh imperial collection.[86] Donald Keene noted that Shunzei was "the most eminent poet since Tsurayuki to have been charged with the compilation of an imperial collection".[87] The anthology, commissioned in 1183 but not completed until 1188, after the defeat of the Taira, contained poems by Taira adherents who had been officially denounced as enemies of the throne, as a gesture to calm the vengeful spirits of the Taira.[88] It also contained poems by thirty-three female poets, the most women recognized by any of the late-Heian imperial collections.[89] Teika, Shunzei's son,[90] would become even more important: his Hyakunin Isshu made him "the arbiter of the poetic tastes of most Japanese even as late as the twentieth century".[91] His later work copying manuscripts was of such importance that Keene noted that "what we know of the literature of Teika's day and earlier is mainly what he thought was worthy of preservation."[92] He also served on the committee that compiled the eighth imperial anthology, the Shin Kokin Wakashū,[93] and along with the itinerant monk Saigyō and Emperor Go-Toba, is considered one of the best poets represented in the collection.[94] More poems by Saigyō were included in the collection than those of any other poet.[95] and centuries later Matsuo Bashō selected him as the representative poet of the waka genre.[96]
