The FTSE 100 broadly consists of the largest 100 qualifying UK companies by full market value.[2] Many of these are internationally focused companies, however, so the index's movements are a fairly weak indicator of how the UK economy is faring - as seen with many of the recent swings corresponding to the value of sterling.[3] A better indication of the UK economy is the FTSE 250, as it contains a smaller proportion of international companies.[4]
