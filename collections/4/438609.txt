The first season of Parks and Recreation started to receive criticism before the premiere episode aired. According to a March 18, 2009 report that was leaked to writer Nikki Finke, focus groups responded poorly to a rough-cut version of the pilot.[119][160] Many focus group members felt the show was a "carbon copy" of The Office. Some found it predictable, slow-paced, and lacking in character development; others said the show lacked strong male characters, particularly a "datable" lead.[160] Schur insisted the pilot had been completely re-edited at least four times since the focus groups described in the report were held.[117] Nevertheless, the early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about the show's chances of success.[65][119]
