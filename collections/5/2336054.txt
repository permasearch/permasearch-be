In 1986, Reagan nominated Sessions to be a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.[25] Sessions's judicial nomination was recommended and actively backed by Republican Alabama Senator Jeremiah Denton.[26] A substantial majority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which rates nominees to the federal bench, rated Sessions "qualified", with a minority voting that Sessions was "not qualified".[27] His nomination was opposed by the NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and People for the American Way.[23]
