On October 21, 1964, Bonanno disappeared and wasn't heard from again for almost two years. After months of no word from Bonanno the Commission named capo Gaspar DiGregorio the new boss.[7][13] The family split into two factions, the DiGregorio supporters and the Bonanno loyalists. In the media the event was referred to as the "Banana Split" or "Banana War".[14] The Bonanno loyalists were led by Bonanno's brother-in-law Frank Labruzzo and his son Bill Bonanno. In 1966, DiGregorio arranged for a sit-down in a house on Troutman Street in Brooklyn.[14] DiGregorio's men arrived at the meeting, and when Bill Bonanno arrived a large gun battle ensued. The DiGregorio loyalists had planned to wipe out the opposition, but they failed, and no one was killed.[12][14]
