In Season 13, Freckles' Ammunition was alternated with Confetti, whenever Caboose pulls the trigger on his gun, due to the fact that there was an incident, Dr. Gray commenting, 'It was quite a busy day at the Hospital'. Only Freckles had control of when the rifle fired live ammunition, which when combined with the gun's smart scope and stabilizer system, allowed Freckles to direct the gun (even in Caboose's hands) anywhere it wished to take out targets with efficiency.
