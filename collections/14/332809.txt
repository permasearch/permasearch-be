Kate Chopin's "The Story of an Hour" presents the heroine as a heartless person who does not fear the death of her husband, but instead is filled with glee and joy. Nicole Diederich questions the "focus on the challenge the ending poses to the reader" (Diederich 117) about how the audience sees her death. Her husband's death was another way to escape the marriage she was binded to whereas her death was also another escape that was expressed at the end of the short story. Heidi Podlasti-Labrenz also supports that Mrs. Mallard was under Brently's influence by stating, "...her strength of character and willpower are apparently mostly controlled and absorbed by Brently Mallard's well-meant but forceful dominance" and claims that her actions as this "crazed" human being was just a reaction after being freed from marriage. Mrs. Mallard, as a character, shows that she was aware of her actions through Brently's arrival. "But, for one climactic hour of her life, Louise does truly taste joy," (Jamil) which happens to cause her frail heart to collapse. Louise Mallard's personality in "The Story of an Hour" was understood to portray an unthoughtful image of what a wife should be. Her actions were to "illustrate the dangers of making assumptions" (Mayer) and in result, her weakened heart had taken her life. Her sister thought of her behavior as nothing but a sickness. Josephine had not thought that her sister's actions were to match her personality, but to think that Louise's reaction was her reaching existentialism. It was not her mind going crazy, but Louise "reaching existentialism" is her finally realizing her time and place as this new awakened being. When the thought of being free in mind and soul, existentialism, that's when she began to act as if she was not normal.
