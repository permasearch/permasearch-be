The campus continues to expand west toward the Congaree River in support of its research initiatives (see below). Three separate sites, each specializing in its own research area, will initially cover 500,000 square feet (46,500 m2) spread over six city blocks and will eventually grow to 5,000,000 square feet (465,000 m2). This new district of campus, named Innovista,[16] will mix university and private research buildings, parking garages, and commercial and residential units. At the center will be a public plaza called Foundation Square.
