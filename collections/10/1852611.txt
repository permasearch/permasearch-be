For a diploid population of size N and neutral mutation rate     μ   {\displaystyle \mu }  , the initial frequency of a novel mutation is simply 1/(2N), and the number of new mutations per generation is     2 N μ   {\displaystyle 2N\mu }  . Since the fixation rate is the rate of novel neutral mutation multiplied by their probability of fixation, the overall fixation rate is     2 N μ ×   1  2 N    = μ   {\displaystyle 2N\mu \times {\frac {1}{2N}}=\mu }  . Thus, the rate of fixation for a mutation not subject to selection is simply the rate of introduction of such mutations.[5][6]
