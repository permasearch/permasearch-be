In 1988 Somali Air Force aircraft conducted intense aerial bombardment of major Isaaq cities targeting civilian Isaaqs during its campaign against Somali National Movement in the north of the country. Civilians were also strafed by Somali Air Force aircraft as they were fleeing the aerial bombardment.[42] The artillery shelling and aerial bombardment caused the deaths of estimated 50,000 - 200,000 Isaaq civilians, as well as the complete destruction of Somalia's second and third largest cities.[43] It also caused up to 500,000[44][45] Somalis (primarily of the Isaaq clan)[46] to flee and cross the border into Hartasheikh in Ethiopia as refugees in what was described as "one of the fastest and largest forced movements of people recorded in Africa",[47] and resulted in the creation of the world's largest refugee camp then (1988),[48] with another 400,000 being internally displaced.[49][50][51] The scale of destruction led to Hargeisa being known as the 'Dresden of Africa'.[52]
