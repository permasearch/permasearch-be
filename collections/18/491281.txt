Dennis E. Smith says that the earliest Christians worshiped at table in their hosts' dining rooms.[80] and that the earliest Christians shaped the traditions about Jesus to fit that setting.[78] In his study Dining Posture in Ancient Rome: Bodies, Values, and Status concerning practice at the meals designated in Latin by the word "convivium", equivalent to "deipnon" and/or "symposion" in Greek,[81] The number of participants at such meals in private houses, as opposed to other specially designated places, would be at most a dozen.[82] The symposium after the meal was the time for teaching and conversation, for the singing of hymns, for the contributions of those who prophesied or spoke in tongues.[78]
