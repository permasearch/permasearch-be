On 11 December 2012, she announced through her Facebook account that she did not get to finish some of the projects she was working on in New York and that she was collaborating in the studio with The Struts in Sweden.[15] The singer decided to use the vocals she recorded for the demo on the song because her vocal performance "was really coming from the heart".[9] The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and BjÃ¶rn Engelmann mastering it.[3] In an interview with Coup de Main magazine, Lo said that: "[While writing the song, I was thinking about] my way of getting through a hard time in 'the best' possible way. It's a big relief to just think 'fuck it all' for a while. We all have to be so perfect, and absolutely no one can live up to it."[16] She later confessed to The Huffington Post that she recovered from the break-up after writing the song.[17]
