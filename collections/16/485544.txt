The Narmada basin, hemmed between Vindya and Satpura ranges, extends over an area of 98,796 km2 (38,145.3 sq mi) and lies between east longitudes 72 degrees 32' to 81 degrees 45' and north latitudes 21 degrees 20' to 23 degrees 45' lying on the northern extremity of the Deccan Plateau. The basin covers large areas in the states of Madhya Pradesh (81%), Gujarat (12%) and a comparatively smaller area (4%) in Maharashtra, (2%) in Chhattisgarh and (1%) in Andhra Pradesh. In the river course of 1,312 km (815.2 mi) explained above, there are 41 tributaries, out of which 22 are from the Satpura range and the rest on the right bank are from the Vindhya range.[6] Dhupgarh (1,350m), near Pachmarhi is the highest point of the Narmada basin[13].
