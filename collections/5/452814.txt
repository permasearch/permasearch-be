While stimulants and atomoxetine are usually safe, there are side-effects and contraindications to their use.[164] There is low quality evidence of an association between methylphenidate and both serious and non-serious harmful side effects when taken by children and adolescents.[183] Careful monitoring of children while taking this medication is recommended.[183] A large overdose on ADHD stimulants is commonly associated with symptoms such as stimulant psychosis and mania.[184] Although very rare, at therapeutic doses these events appear to occur in approximately 0.1% of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy.[184][185][186] Administration of an antipsychotic medication has been found to effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.[184] Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long-term treatment.[187] Stimulant therapy should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication, decrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance.[188][189] Long-term misuse of stimulant medications at doses above the therapeutic range for ADHD treatment is associated with addiction and dependence.[190][191] Untreated ADHD, however, is also associated with elevated risk of substance use disorders and conduct disorders.[190] The use of stimulants appears to either reduce this risk or have no effect on it.[19][172][190] The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear.[192]
