At St Trinian's, Miss Holland the accountant, explains to headmistress Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim) that they need cash, not cheques. Then Fritton's twin brother, bookmaker Clarence (Alastair Sim), arrives with his previously expelled sixth form daughter Arabella (Vivienne Martin). He gets his sister to re-enroll her so she can befriend Fatima and get information on Arab Boy, the Sultan's horse that will run in the upcoming Cheltenham Gold Cup against Blue Prince, the horse he and his associates have backed. Assistant headmistress/physics mistress Buckland (Mary Merrall) enters the office to introduce Fatima and two other new girls to Fritton, and Fatima meets Arabella. Fritton explains St Trinian's to the new girls: "At most schools, girls are sent out quite unprepared for a merciless world but, when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared." Fritton takes the new girls to meet the staff: Miss Brimmer (Ren√©e Houston) arts and handicrafts mistress; Miss Wilson (Beryl Reid) maths mistress; Mlle. de St Emilion (Balbina Gutierrez) French mistress; Miss Drownder (Hermione Baddeley) geography mistress; Miss Gale (Irene Handl) English literature mistress; Miss Waters (Betty Ann Davies) the scripture and needlework mistress; and Miss Dawn (Joan Sims).
