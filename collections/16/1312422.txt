According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526-1857), as a confluence of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian pilaf.[12] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals.[13] However, another theory claims that the dish was known in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur came to India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India.[15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14]
