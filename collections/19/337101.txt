The 2000GT was the flagship model of the XX range. Featuring the smaller 2.0-litre six-cylinder DOHC 24-valve 1G-EU, Yamaha took the base 1G-EU and improved it, resulting in the 1G-GEU significantly upping the output of the engine, which also served in the 1985 Toyota Soarer. The smaller-capacity engine meant road taxes were less than the bigger 5M-GEU of the 2800GT. 1G-GEU made 160 PS (118Â kW) at 6400 rpm
