In January 1975 the junta members were arrested and in early August of the same year the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis brought charges of high treason and insurrection against Georgios Papadopoulos and nineteen other co-conspirators of the military junta.[101] The mass trial was staged at the Korydallos Prison. The trial was described as "Greece's Nuremberg".[101] One thousand soldiers armed with submachine guns provided security.[101] The roads leading to the jail were patrolled by tanks.[101]
