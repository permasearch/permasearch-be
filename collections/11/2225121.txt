After her dismissal from the crime lab, Aiden is apparently working on getting her private investigator's license while continuing to search for evidence that would conclusively tie Pratt to the Regina Bowen case.  In the penultimate season 2 episode, "Heroes", Aiden, after shadowing Pratt for months, is lured, ambushed, and brutally murdered by him, her body incinerated inside a stolen car. However, knowing that her time is drawing short, she leaves behind critical evidence that she knows will help her former colleagues to close in on Pratt and finally see him arrested.
