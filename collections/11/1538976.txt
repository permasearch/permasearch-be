The Enquiry into Plants (along with the Causes of Plants) was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza by 1454, circulated in manuscript, and then published at Treviso in 1483.[a] In its original Greek it first appeared from the press of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495–98, from a single corrupt manuscript which has since been lost.[b] Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to Johann Gottlob Schneider, who with H. F. Link made the first modern critical edition, Leipzig 1818–1821, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.[6]
