Shark Tale had its worldwide premiere on September 10, 2004 in Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy.[12] Screening as part of the Venice Film Festival, it marked the first time that Piazza San Marco was closed for a premiere of a major feature film.[12] The film was projected on the largest inflatable screen in the world, measuring more than six stories tall and over 3,900 square feet (360 m2). It required 20,000 cubic feet (570 m3) of air to inflate and more than 50 tons of water for stabilization.[12] The premiere was attended by 6,000 visitors,[13] including Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Robert De Niro, and Michael Imperioli.[12] Jeffrey Katzenberg, the executive producer of the film, explained that they "wanted to find a unique way to introduce this movie to the world. We needed a big idea. … More than anything, we are in showbusiness. This is the show part."[13]
