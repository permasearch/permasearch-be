The majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham,[24] when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina.[25][26][27] This timeline has been challenged by a number of scholars in modern times.[28] Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque.[29]
