However, despite warm and cool parenting methods, parents who encounter a language barrier rely more heavily on their children to utilize the Internet.

Katz notes that the majority resources that immigrants find helpful are located online, however the search algorithms currently in place do not direct languages other than English appropriately. Because of this shortcoming, parents strongly encourage their bilingual children to bridge the gap between the Internet and language.[42]
