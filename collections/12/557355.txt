Towards the end of the 1960s, Diners Club also faced competition from banks that issued revolving credit cards through Bank of America's BankAmericard (later renamed Visa), and Interbank Master Charge (later renamed MasterCard). Diners Club began early on to allow franchises of the Diners Club name, at first in Europe and later throughout the world, for many years eclipsing the BankAmericard or Interbank Master Charge networks abroad. Starting in 1968, the American Oil Company, better known publicly as Amoco, also issued, for a time, its own co-branded Diners Club cards called American Torch Club[25] (later renamed Amoco Torch Club), and Sun Oil Company issued its version called Sun Diner Club Card starting in 1977.[26]
