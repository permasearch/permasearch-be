There are, historically, six experimentally separable ways in which sound waves are analysed. They are:  pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and  spatial location.[16] Some of these terms have a standardised definition (for instance in the ANSI Acoustical Terminology ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013). More recent approaches have also considered temporal envelope and temporal fine structure as perceptually relevant analyses.[17][18][19]
