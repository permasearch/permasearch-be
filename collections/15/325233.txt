Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans.[79] There is normally as little as 0.5 milligrams found within the entire human body; human breast milk contains 4 ppm.[80] Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount.[80] With up to 700 ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.[80]
