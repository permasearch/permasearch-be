Chimera Ants (キメラ＝アント, Kimera Anto) are a fictional species of insect, extremely dangerous and ranked first among insects that should be quarantined in the Hunter × Hunter universe.[ch. 187] They have voracious appetites and can consume several times their own weight within a single day. Chimera Ant queens possess an entirely unique method of reproduction known as Phagogenesis (摂食交配, Sesshoku Kōhai): reproducing asexually while imbuing her offspring with the genetic traits of whatever she devoured.[ch. 187] To take advantage of the genes of a particular species to create royal caste Chimera Ants superior to the previous generations, a Chimera Ant queen has been known to feed until the fodder species is driven to extinction. One colony in particular targeted humans, leading to the creation of humanoid Chimera Ants who develop the ability to use Nen and possess a sense of free will outside serving their queen. Human Chimera Ants also possess the genetic memories of their "past lives", some only having traces of memories while others are their original selves fully reborn. Following the death of the Queen, the colony disburst with a majority of Chimera Ants following Meruem while others attempted to create their colonies. Only a few the humanoid Chimera Ants survive as they are allowed to live among humans.
