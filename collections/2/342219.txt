Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia. These include Millon's base (Hg2N+), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of HgNH+ 2) n), and "fusible white precipitate" or [Hg(NH3)2]Cl2. Known as Nessler's reagent, potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) (HgI2âˆ’ 4) is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base.
