At 780 ca. we find traders at Pavia offering goods from he orient, e.g. Tyrian purple.[5] Before 785 already, venetian traders resided in Ravenna and in the so-called Pentapolis, men that had been "expelled" by the Franks in 787/791.[6] About thirty years earlier they did appear in the slave trade with the saracenes.[7]
