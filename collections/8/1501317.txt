Spielberg had three ideas that he wanted Jaffa and Silver to implement into the script: a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, a human who has a relationship with trained raptors (from Sayles's earlier draft), and a homicidal dinosaur that escapes and has to be stopped.[5][137][120] Jaffa and Silver's draft, titled Jurassic Park IV,[113][120] included an opening scene set in China,[109] where the fossilized remains of a new dinosaur species would be discovered by a Chinese female paleontologist.[138][5] In the draft, the remains would be stolen by a corporation with malicious intentions, ultimately leading the paleontologist and her two sons to visit Jurassic Park.[138][5] Jaffa and Silver worked on the script for approximately a year, with input from Spielberg.[139]
