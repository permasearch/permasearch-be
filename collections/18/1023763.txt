Outside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically 730 metres (2,400Â ft) per side (called centuria), and contained 100 parcels of land (each called heredium).[9] The decumanus maximus and cardo maximus extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.[9]
