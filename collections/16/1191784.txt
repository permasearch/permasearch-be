A music video for the song was directed by Walter Stern and Jeff Richter. An alternate version of the video was later released.[2][3] The video begins with a series of macrophotographic close-ups of Trent Reznor, including his eyes, hair, and mouth. The video concludes with the Nine Inch Nails band performing the song in a red room and eventually destroying their equipment and the set itself. Into the Void was nominated for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards Breakthrough Video award, but lost out to Bj√∂rk's All Is Full of Love, directed by Chris Cunningham.
