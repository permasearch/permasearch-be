During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo had extensive urbanisation, and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a "model colony".[8] One of the results was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African "évolués" in the cities.[8] By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony.[9]
