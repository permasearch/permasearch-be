In 1999, the MTA proposed a $17 billion five-year capital budget. This budget included a $1.6 billion LIRR connection to Grand Central, as well as several subway extensions.[53] The project's final environmental impact assessment (FEIS) was released in March 2001.[54]:1[a] The FEIS reviewed two key options for bringing LIRR service to Grand Central. The first option was to connect the tunnels to the existing lower level at Grand Central, while the second option was to build an entirely new station underneath the existing Metro-North platforms. The MTA ultimately recommended selecting the second option because it was cheaper and less disruptive to Metro-North service.[54]:4[4]:4 In May 2001, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) gave a favorable "Record of Decision", a mark of approval, to East Side Access after reviewing the project's FEIS.[4]:3[54]
