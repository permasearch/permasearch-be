St Mary's College retains much of its original sixteenth century buildings, specifically the north and West ranges. The Quad contains a thorn tree said to have been planted by Mary, Queen of Scots, during her many visits to St. Andrews. The Quad also contains the historic King James Library founded by King James VI & I in 1612.[4]  In addition the College has The Roundel, a 16th-century building dedicated for doctoral students studying divinity at the University of St Andrews.
