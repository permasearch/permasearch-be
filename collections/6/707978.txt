The goal of DayZ is to stay alive and healthy during the conditions of the zombie outbreak that have befallen the in-game world. The player begins equipped with only simple clothes, a road flare  and a rag, and must begin exploring the large 225Â km2 landscape of the fictional former Soviet Republic of Chernarus to investigate locations such as houses, barns, and apartments to scavenge supplies.[1][2][3] These supplies include food and water, which are basic keys to prolonging the player's life.[4][5] Beyond the bare bones of survival, players can find various forms of clothing, which not only allow the player to customize their character, but can bring the benefit of extra storage space for supplies and warmth.[6] Also scattered around the map are a variety of weapons, allowing players to protect themselves from zeds or other players if necessary. These are largely focused on a range of melee weapons, but a small number of firearms (more are to be implemented with future updates) are present, as well as various attachments such as bipods and telescopic sights. Player interaction is a major part of DayZ gameplay. The game provides in-game voice chat which allows players to communicate with each other within a certain distance. Text chat is also provided for those players who lack any means of voice communication. DayZ also provides in game actions such as the ability to wave to other players and allowing players to put their hands up in order to show that they surrender.[7]
