In Canada, juries are used for some criminal trials but not others. For summary conviction offences[36] or offences found under section 553 of the Criminal Code (theft and fraud up to the value of $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most indictable offences, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury.[37] In the most serious offences, found in section 469 of the Criminal Code (such as murder or treason), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury.[38] The jury's verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous,[39] but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.[40][41]
