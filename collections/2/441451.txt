An internet meme, called "Smokin' Jay Cutler", portrays pictures of Cutler in an apathetic state with a cigarette photoshopped into his mouth. Cutler commented he is aware of the meme and "gets a kick out of that".[191] Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers performed a smoking gesture to reference the meme during a 38â€“14 win over the Bears in 2014.[192]
