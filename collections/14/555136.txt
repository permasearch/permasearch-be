Mark and Jez's Canadian friend from university, Merry, (played by Meredith MacNeill) arrives at their flat and stays the night. Her mother died recently and she is suffering a manic episode. She sexually propositions Mark, but he declines her advances. She gives away to Jez and Super Hans the disused pub which she owns. However, Jez disagrees with Super Hans' proposed new name for the pub â€“ Free the Paedos. Mark phones the NHS to have her sectioned shortly afterwards.
