Doctor Strange is described as "the mightiest magician in the cosmos"[63] and "more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids" by Eternity, the sentience of the Marvel Universe.[64] He holds the title of Sorcerer Supreme from 1973 (with the death of the Ancient One)[20] to the present, except during an interruption from 1992[65] to 1995.[66] He relinquishes the title once again in 2009,[36] but reclaims it in 2012 when he proves himself willing to protect the world even without the title.[40]
