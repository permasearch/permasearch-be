This album was quite a success, and after being reissued in a 45-rpm version [5] and as a 10-inch LP, it was finally re-released in 1956 [6] as one side of a 12-inch 33​1⁄3 rpm LP, the other side occupied by cover versions of songs from Disney's Pinocchio (1940), with Cliff Edwards, the film's Jiminy Cricket, as lead soloist. (Perhaps not so coincidentally, this is also the year that MGM Records first released an authentic soundtrack album of The Wizard of Oz.)
