In Korean, the line is called the Hyujeonseon (휴전선), meaning "armistice line."[5]  It is also sometimes called the Gunsa Bungye-seon (군사분계선), which literally means "military demarcation line."  However, in colloquial usage, the dividing line is more often called the Sampalseon (삼팔선, "38th parallel"), a name likely coined at the end of World War II, when it would have been an accurate description of the North-South border.
