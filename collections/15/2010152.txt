Pariksha Guru was the first modern Hindi novel. It cautioned young men of well-to-do families against the dangerous influence of bad company and consequent loose morals. Pariksha Guru reflects the inner and outer world of the newly emerging middle classes. The characters are caught in the difficulty of adapting to colonial society while preserving their cultural identity. The world of colonial modernity seems both frightening and irresistible.
