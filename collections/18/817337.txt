On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court determined in the case of Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission[65][66] that the FCC had no authority to enforce network neutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as "common carriers".[67] The court agreed that FCC can regulate broadband and may craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers.[68]
