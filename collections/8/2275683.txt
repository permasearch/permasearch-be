Prior to GameÂ 1, a tribute to late Commissioner Bart Giamatti was held; Giamatti's son Marcus threw out the first pitch, and the Whiffenpoofs from Yale University (Giamatti's alma mater) sang the national anthem.[6] Dave Stewart, the Athletics' ace, took on Giants pitcher Scott Garrelts in game one of the Bay Bridge series.
