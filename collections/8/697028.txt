For print media workers the Government of India has notified a DA Formula in the Gazette No 2532(E) of Nov 11, 2011, as recommended by the Majithia Wage Board for Journalists and Non-Journalists. The said Gazette notified formula was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court of India by its judgment made on Feb 7, 2014. The Hon. Supreme Court upheld the recommendations as 'revised and determined' by Hon Justice (retd) Majithia. While 115.76 is the Base and Divisor for Central Government staff, for employees coming under Majithia Wage Board 167 had been recommended as Base and Divisor. The said 167 is the 12-month average of July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010.
