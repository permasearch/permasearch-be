Portrayed by Gregory Harrison since season six, Paul Norris is Julian's father. He has stayed very close to Peyton even though she broke up with his son, but much like most Tree Hill parents, he has a very rocky relationship with his son. He has been hinted of sharing an infatuation with Brooke's mother Victoria.
