The Mitsubishi GTO is a sports car built by the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi between 1990 and 1999. In most export markets it was rebadged as the Mitsubishi 3000GT. It was also imported and sold by Chrysler of North America as the Dodge Stealth captive import from 1990 to 1996 with only minor detail/appearance differences; mechanically, the two cars were almost identical. The design was the result of the collaborative effort between Chrysler and its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors. This differed from the two companies' other collaboration, Diamond-Star Motors, because both the Stealth and the 3000GT were assembled in Japan. The Japanese domestic market model took its name from the Galant GTO, a two-door hardtop coup√© sold by the company in the early 1970s, which in turn took its name from a specific international endurance motor sport technical regulation, expressed in Italian as Gran Turismo Omologato.
