By the early 1980s The Generation Game was being beaten by ITV's Game for a Laugh, which had the same producer (who had defected). The show continued but in 1982, Grayson decided to quit whilst the show was still popular. The BBC approached Jimmy Tarbuck to present the show but turned it down. The show was later cancelled.[4]
