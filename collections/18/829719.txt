However, Shirou's simple life with Sakura and Taiga is suddenly upended in a violent encounter with a blue-clad warrior of supernatural strength, wielding a red spear. Meanwhile, Sakura runs into a blond-haired man who says something that shocks her. After being impaled by the spear-wielder, Shirou is somehow revived from imminent death and later, when the spearman attacks him at home, accidentally summons Saber - an armored swordswoman with an invisible weapon. Saber protects Shirou from the spearman at the cost of an injury, driving him off before facing another superpowered foe, Archer, and nearly killing him in the process. However, Archer turns out to be in the service of Rin Tohsaka, a school acquaintance of Shirou. Noting that Shirou is utterly clueless regarding the current situation, Rin declares a temporary truce and takes Shirou and Saber to see Kirei Kotomine, a brooding priest at a nearby church.
