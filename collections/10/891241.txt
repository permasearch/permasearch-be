Del Toro and Jackson had a positive working relationship, in which they compromised on disagreements for the benefit of the film.[22] Del Toro believed he would be able to shoot the film himself,[39] although Jackson noted he had similar hopes for filming all of his trilogy and offered to help as second unit director. Del Toro planned on shooting the film in the trilogy's 2.35:1 aspect ratio, rather than his signature 1.85:1 ratio.[22] He hoped to collaborate again with cinematographer Guillermo Navarro.[35]
