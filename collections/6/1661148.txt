One serotype and seven different genetic groups (four human and three simian) have been described.[19] The human genotypes are numbered I-III. Six subtypes have been described (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB). The simian genotypes have been numbered IV-VI. A single isolate of genotype VII isolated from a human has also been described.[20] Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys. Most human isolates are of genotype I.[21] Of the type I isolates subtype IA accounts for the majority.
