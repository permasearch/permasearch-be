Delivering checkmate is difficult if the technique has not been studied and practiced. Even grandmasters, including GM Vladimir Epishin and Women's World Champion GM Anna Ushenina, have obtained the endgame but failed to win it.  In the Kempinski v. Epishin game, both players made suboptimal moves. The superior side had no idea how to win and ended up stalemating several moves after the inferior side could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule.[18]
