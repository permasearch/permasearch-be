The music was by Shankar Jaikishan, and interestingly, the whole soundtrack was sung only by Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar. Many of the songs went on to become classics and are still remembered even now, particularly, "Jiya O Jiya" and "Teri Zulphon Se Judai", sung by Mohammad Rafi, were big hits as well as "Sau Saal Pehle", by Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar. "Sau Saal Pehle" was later used in the Tamil film Vallavanukku Vallavan as "Manam Ennum".[2]
