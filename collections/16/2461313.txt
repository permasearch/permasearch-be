According to Jobsâ€™s biography, two versions were created before it first aired: one with a voiceover by Richard Dreyfuss and one featuring a voiceover by Steve Jobs.[5] In the morning of the first air date, Jobs decided to go with the Dreyfuss version, stating that it was about Apple, not about himself. It was edited at Venice Beach Editorial, by Dan Bootzin, Chiat\Day's in-house editor,[6] and post-produced by Hunter Conner.
