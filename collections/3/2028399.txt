Brady v. Maryland (1963) is another significant, specific criminal procedural right guaranteed by the due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment[152]) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, and there is a reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality").[153] Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.[154]
