"Crimson and Clover" was a huge success, and the group would have two follow-up hits that also reached the Hot 100's top 10, "Sweet Cherry Wine" and "Crystal Blue Persuasion". James, who co-wrote all three of those songs,[8] and his band did well enough with the transition to be invited to perform at Woodstock. James describes Artie Kornfeld's invitation like this: "Artie was up and asked if you could play at this pig farm up in upstate New York." I said, "What?!?" "Well, they say it's gonna be a lot of people there, and it's gonna be a really important show." At the time James was in Hawaii and was incredulous about being asked to travel 6,000 miles to play a show on an upstate New York pig farm, telling the Roulette Records secretary, "If I'm not there, start without us, will you please?"[1][3] In 1970, after four minor hits, drugs almost killed James when, at a concert, he collapsed, and was pronounced dead. However, he survived, hated the recording studio, and moved up into the country to vegetate. The Shondells, without James, recorded and released two albums under the name Hog Heaven before disbanding three years later.[4]
