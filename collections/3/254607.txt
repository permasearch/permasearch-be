According to the definition by IUPAC, the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes.[4] Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is C nH 2n−2k+2, where k is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the acyclic (loopless) ones, corresponding to k = 0.
