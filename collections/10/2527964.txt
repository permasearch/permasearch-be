From the east, from Broadway in the Marine Villa neighborhood to the intersection of Grand Boulevard and Gravois Avenue in the Gravois Park neighborhood. Then it picks up again running east-west from Gustine Avenue to Bent Avenue. Next it runs east-west from Morganford Road to Tholozan Avenue. Finally, it runs east-west from Oleatha Avenue to Sublette Avenue in the Kingshighway Hills neighborhood. Miami Street was named for the Miami River and the Miami people of Ohio in the 1850s.
