The New Mexico whiptail (Cnemidophorus neomexicanus) is a female-only species of lizard found in the southern United States in New Mexico and Arizona, and in northern Mexico in Chihuahua. It is the official state reptile of New Mexico.[1] It is one of many lizard species known to be parthenogenic. Individuals of the species can be created either through the hybridization of the little striped whiptail (C. inornatus) and the western whiptail (C. tigris),[2] or through the parthenogenic reproduction of an adult New Mexico whiptail.
