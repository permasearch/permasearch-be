When it comes to choice, James says we make a choice based on different experiences.  It comes from our own past experiences, the observations of others or as James himself says “A supply of ideas of the various movements that are […] left in the memory by experiences of their involuntary performance is thus the first prerequisite of the voluntary life.” [39] What James describes is that once you’ve made a decision in the past, the experience is stockpiled into your memory where it can be referenced the next time a decision must be made.  And will be drawn from as a positive solution.  But in his development of the design, James also struggled with being able to prove that free will is actually free or predetermined.
