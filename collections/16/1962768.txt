In the years immediately following the declaration of independence, both the Japanese occupation and conflict between Dutch and Republican forces had crippled the country's production, with exports of comities such as rubber and oil being reduced to 12 and 5 percent their pre-WW2 levels, respectively.[22] The first Republican government-controlled bank, Bank Negara Indonesia (Indonesian State Bank) or BNI, was founded on July 5, 1946 and initially acted as the manufacturer and distributor of ORI (Oeang Republik Indonesia/Money of the Republic of Indonesia), a currency issued by the Republican Government which was the predecessor of Rupiah.[23] Despite so, currency issued during the Japanese occupation and by Dutch authorities were still in circulation, and simplicity of the ORI made its counterfeiting straightforward, worsening matters.[24] Once the nation's independence has been recognized by the Netherlands on December 1949, the next 10 years saw the devaluation of Dutch banknotes into half their value (Gunting Sjafruddin),[25] dissolution of the United States of Indonesia in August 1950, and during the liberal democracy period the nationalization of De Javasche Bank into modern Bank Indonesia[26] and the takeover of Dutch corporate assets following the West New Guinea dispute.[27]
