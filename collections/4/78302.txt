In 2003, a method was developed for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins.[104] Subsequent to this, various modes of Chou's pseudo amino acid composition were developed for improving the quality of predicting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.[105][106][107][108]
