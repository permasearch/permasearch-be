In the following years, the Voyager writers wrote several plot lines revolving around Seven's exploration of the positive and negative sides of human individuality. The cyborg nature of the character is seen as representing a challenge to "simple conceptions of connections/disconnections between bodies."[6] Ryan maintained that the main topic about Seven was "humanity" and stated that her character was pivotal to the success of the show, because she "brought conflict to the show, which was sadly lacking. â€¦ The Voyager crew was just one big happy family." After the addition of the former Borg drone to the starship's crew at the start of the fourth season of Voyager, the shows' weekly viewer ratings increased by more than 60%.[7] Ryan's arrival on the show was accompanied by a massive publicity campaign in TV magazines and newspaper supplements.[8] Ryan thought that the increase may have been because of the way the character looked, but maintained that those viewers would have been retained by the writing on the show.[9]
