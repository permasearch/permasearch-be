For most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona. From seasons one through eight, Clark was typically dressed in either red, yellow and blue (the traditional colors of the Superman costume), or in the All-American colors of red, white, and blue.[71] This included the primary usage of either a blue T-shirt underneath a red jacket, or a red T-shirt worn under a blue jacket.[76] In season nine, the producers decided to design an actual costume for Clark to wear while patrolling the streets of Metropolis. Abandoning the theme of red, blue, and yellow, the producers chose to keep the costume completely black, save for a silver Superman "S" shield painted on the front. Instead of the traditional cape, Clark's red jacket is traded for a black trenchcoat.[77] This drew comparison to the character of Neo from The Matrix film series. It was also compared to the black suit Superman wore after being resurrected, following his death at the hands of Doomsday in the comic books.[78][79]
