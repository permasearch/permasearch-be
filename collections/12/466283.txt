The Met's collection of Greek and Roman art contains more than 17,000 objects.[31] The Greek and Roman collection dates back to the founding of the museumâ€”in fact, the museum's first accessioned object was a Roman sarcophagus, still currently on display. Though the collection naturally concentrates on items from ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, these historical regions represent a wide range of cultures and artistic styles, from classic Greek black-figure and red-figure vases to carved Roman tunic pins.[citation needed]
