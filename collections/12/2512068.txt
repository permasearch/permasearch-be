Lee wins Â£1000 in a writing competition with an essay entitled 'Disability in the Workplace', and spends the money on a set of football mugs. Lucy finds herself moved to tears when she reads the essay, as she had no idea that Lee was so sensitive. However, Lee admits to Tim that he actually downloaded the essay off the internet, and, as the competition was only open to disabled people, he is pretending to be blind.
