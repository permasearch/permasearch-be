The second meeting of the year between the teams came with the Jets hosting on December 21. Despite having already been eliminated from the postseason, the 3–11 Jets played for pride and nearly completed a stunning upset over New England. After the Patriots took a 7–0 lead, the Jets scored 13 points unanswered, taking the lead into the fourth quarter. A late surge by Brady and the Patriots, led to scoring 10 straight to take the 17–13 lead.[50] A Patriots 3rd down conversion attempt was ruled a first down. The referee did not give the signal for a first down immediately, the scoreboard showed the down as 4th an inches while the chain gang showed 1st and ten, but from the original marker locations. Jets coach Rex Ryan challenged the first down. The play was reviewed, and the ruling on the field stood, costing NY a timeout.[citation needed] Later, with the score 17–16 and five minutes left in the game, the Jets attempted a goal-ahead field goal from 52 yards away, but the kick was tipped by Vince Wilfork. The Patriots offense took over and proceeded to run the clock out to seal the win.[50] The game proved to be the last home game for Rex Ryan, who was fired after the season,[51] and the game marked the 450th career regular-season win (and 475th overall win) in Patriots history.[52]
