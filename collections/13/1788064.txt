Salivary gland dysfunction refers to either xerostomia (the symptom of dry mouth) or salivary gland hypofunction (reduced production of saliva); it is associated with significant impairment of quality of life.[30] Following radiotherapy of the head and neck region, salivary gland dysfunction is a predictable side-effect.[30] Saliva production may be pharmacologically stimulated by sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline.[31] It can also be suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy.[32] A Cochrane review found there was no strong evidence that topical therapies are effective in relieving the symptoms of dry mouth.[33]
