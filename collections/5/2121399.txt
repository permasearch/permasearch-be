Geoff Nelson of Consequence of Sound coined the track as one of Reputation's strongest moments, along with "Gorgeous" and "Call It What You Want".[13] Zach Schonfeld of Newsweek called it as "the album's first real moment of vulnerability", and it succeeds by "peeling back all the bravado and EDM aggression of the opening tracks".[14] In another positive review, Roisin Oâ€™Connor of The Independent stated that "Taylor Swift produced some of her most honest and direct songwriting to date", and ""Delicate" was one of the best examples of that".[15]
