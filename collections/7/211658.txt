Rex was the featured character for the 2010 Star Wars merchandise trade dress created by Pilot Studio.[34] The concept initially featured Anakin Skywalker, but discussions of other characters best suited to representing the brand led to Rex, "a strong, courageous character who is clearly one of the heroes ofÂ The Clone Wars". Pilot Studio was initially reluctant to use Rex because his helmet did not allow for eye contact, an emphasized element in the initial trade dress concept.[35]
