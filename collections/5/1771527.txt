However, this will only happen if line break code is manually added somewhere in the summary. In episode 2, adding a line break to the end of the "Guest stars" line and another line after that (in this case a note) fixes the formatting, but that's only a fix if you need a second line. When only one note is needed, two line breaks have to be added directly after the original summary text, as in episode 3. This was never needed in the past. Episode 1 was the standard formatting.
