Organisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[82] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[82] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[83] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[84] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[85] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[86]
