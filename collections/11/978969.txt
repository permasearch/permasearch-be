When the war ended, more than 25,000 U.S.-laid mines were still in place, and the Navy proved unable to sweep them all, limiting efforts to critical areas.[29] After sweeping for almost a year, in May 1946, the Navy abandoned the effort with 13,000 mines still unswept.[29] Over the next thirty years, more than 500 minesweepers (of a variety of types) were damaged or sunk clearing them.[29]
