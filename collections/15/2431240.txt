Hello, this isn't really about the Fed, but does anyone have the authority to restrict edits so that only registered users can make changes to the article? There are a lot of nonsense edits being made (though they're quickly erased). Anyway, I think it would be a service to the sane majority if we could restrict access. Just a suggestion.--Dark Charles (talk) 04:42, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
