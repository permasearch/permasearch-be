Paul Nicholas played the role on the West End and Terrence Mann originated the role in the Broadway version. Rum Tum Tugger is played by John Partridge in the filmed version. In the 25th Anniversary tour of CATS, the role of Rum Tum Tugger was performed by Gary Watson. Right now in the Worldwide tour he is played by Adam Steiner. He is played by Tyler Hanes in the 2016 Broadway Revival. In most productions he sings 'The Rum Tum Tugger', 'Magical Mr Mistoffelees', and, along with Munkustrap he sings 'Old Deuteronomy'. In "Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats," he does not have his mane; he has a different wig and does not have his belt on yet. His first appearance with his mane and proper Rum Tum Tugger wig and accessories is in his own song (which he enjoys greatly - he gets to destroy the Gumbie Cat's fun.)
