Founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield,[3] the FA Community Shield began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI.[4] In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time.[5][a] As part of a sponsorship deal between The Football Association and American restaurant chain McDonald's, the match was officially referred to as "The FA Community Shield supported by McDonald's".[1] It was televised live in the United Kingdom on BT Sport 1,[7] with highlights shown later that night on BBC One.[8] The FA brought the kick-off time an hour earlier to avoid a fixture clash with the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 Final.[9]
