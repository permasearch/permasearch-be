In 115 BC the central government's mint was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks.[149] In 113 BC the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had previously been outlawed in 144 BC.[14] The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the sole right to issue coinage throughout the empire.[150] However, Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25â€“57 AD) abolished the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became the responsibility of the Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.[149]
