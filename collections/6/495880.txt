It is not known how many people died on the inner German border or who they were, as East Germany treated such information as a closely guarded secret. But numbers have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. Current unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 1,100Â people,[29] though officially released figures give a lower count for the death toll before and after the Berlin Wall was built.
