It has also been found that new lines of transgenic GFP rats can be relevant for gene therapy as well as regenerative medicine.[45] By using "high-expresser" GFP, transgenic rats display high expression in most tissues, and many cells that have not been characterized or have been only poorly characterized in previous GFP-transgenic rats.
