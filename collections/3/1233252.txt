North does not have to be at the top. Most maps in medieval Europe, for example, placed east (E) at the top.[1] A few cartographers prefer south-up maps. Many portable GPS-based navigation computers today can be set to display maps either conventionally (N always up, E always right) or with the current instantaneous direction of travel, called the heading, always up (and whatever direction is +90Â° from that to the right).
