Molly Bloom herself discussed Chastain's portrayal of her character with ET Canada stating, "We spent a little time together. She didn't have much time for prep or research," Bloom tells ET Canada's Matte Babel. "I was blown away by her performance by how right it was and how deep and understood I felt by her performance."[22]
