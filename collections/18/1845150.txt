In the early 1980s, Braga, who had already made films like Lady on the Bus (1978), decided to devote herself exclusively to the movies. In 1981, she starred in Eu Te Amo directed by Arnaldo Jabor, and won the best actress award at the Gramado Film Festival. She starred in the movie Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985) alongside William Hurt and Raul Julia.[8] Her role led to a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress and its success led to her international work.[9] She decided to leave Brazil for a career in the United States, where she lived for 14 years. In 2003, she obtained American citizenship.[10]
