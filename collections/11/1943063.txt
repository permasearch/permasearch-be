On 1 April 2015 the Highways Agency became Highways England, a government-owned company. A government review in 2015 recommended two options for the future of traffic officers: a single National Infrastructure Constabulary combining the function of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the Ministry of Defence Police and the British Transport Police with the traffic officer service; two separate forces: a Transport Infrastructure Constabulary, that would include the traffic officer services, and an Armed Infrastructure Constabulary.[2] As of February 2017 these proposals have been put on hold whilst the three police forces involved explore collaborative working options.[3]
