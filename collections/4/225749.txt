James Dreyfus portrayed the Master's first incarnation opposite David Bradley as the First Doctor in the audio series, Doctor Who: The First Doctor Adventures.[108]. In this audio, the Master has been trapped on the distant colony world known only as 'Destination' after his TARDIS was seriously damaged, manipulating the local populations into a state of war so that the resulting technological development will reach a point where he can repair his TARDIS. When the First Doctor arrives on the planet, the Master tries to steal the Doctor's ship, but his plans fail, resulting in the Master being trapped in his laboratory- the remains of his TARDIS- which is now so low on power that he cannot even open the doors[109].
