In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is attributed with the power of working miracles.[26][60] In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life.[60][61][62][63] While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive).[61] The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true.[62] Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.[61][62]
