When Oklahoma Territory was created in 1890, seven counties were defined and designated as first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh, respectively. Thereafter, when additional lands were opened to settlement, new counties were designated by the letters of the alphabet. Later, by vote of the people, these were given permanent county names. The first seven numbered counties, later were named as follows: Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne and Beaver.[17]
