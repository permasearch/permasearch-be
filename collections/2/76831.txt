Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.[16] Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum framebag capacity. This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube and a reduced stem degree.[19]
