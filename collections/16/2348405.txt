Singles wards are set up in areas with high populations of single adults. Young Single Adult (YSA) wards are intended for single members ages 18 to 30, and Single Adult (SA) wards are for single members over the age of 30. Non-custodial parents may also be members of these wards on a case-by-case basis. These wards provide LDS singles the opportunity to serve in offices of the church. Members are taught the same principles of the gospel as a traditional ward, while receiving attention particular to their spiritual needs.[citation needed]
