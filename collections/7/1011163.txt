When a pregnant thirteen-year-old girl (Piper Curda) refuses to identify her baby's father (Jacob Kogan), Benson and the SVU squad work to determine if she was raped. Their investigation leads to a high-profile political couple (Kyle MacLachlan and Paige Turco) and the son (Anthony Keyvan) of their housekeeper (Judy Reyes). The detectives uncover much more than they bargained for when a family secret is revealed and a family member goes missing.
