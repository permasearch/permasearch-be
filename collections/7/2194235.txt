In March 2017, Munoz was named "Communicator of the Year for 2017" by PRWeek.[4] The following month Munoz received widespread criticism for his handling of the issues after a ticketed passenger was forcibly removed from United Airlines Flight 3411,[5] leading Steve Barrett, Editor-in-chief of PRWeek US, to state "if PRWeek was choosing its Communicator of the Year now, we would not be awarding it to Oscar Munoz â€¦ In time, the episode and subsequent response will be quoted in textbooks as an example of how not to respond in a crisis."[6]  Subsequently, on April 21, 2017, UCH announced that Munoz would remain chief executive officer of the airlines but would "not take broader control of the company as previously planned."[7]  Munoz had been scheduled to assume the role of chairman of the board of UCH at the company's 2018 annual stockholders' meeting.[7]
