The Boston television DMA, which also includes Manchester, New Hampshire, is the 8th largest in the United States.[249] The city is served by stations representing every major American network, including WBZ-TV 4 and its sister station WSBK-TV 38 (the former a CBS O&O, the latter an MyNetwork TV affiliate), WCVB-TV 5 and its sister station WMUR-TV 9 (both ABC), WHDH 7 and its sister station WLVI 56 (the former an independent station, the latter a CW affiliate), WBTS-LD 8 (a NBC O&O), and WFXT 25 (Fox). The city is also home to PBS member station WGBH-TV 2, a major producer of PBS programs,[250] which also operates WGBX 44. Spanish-language television networks, including Azteca (WFXZ-CD 24), Univision (WUNI 27), Telemundo (WNEU 60, a sister station to WBTS-LD), and UniMÃ¡s (WUTF-DT 66), have a presence in the region, with WNEU and WUTF serving as network owned-and-operated stations. Most of the area's television stations have their transmitters in nearby Needham and Newton along the Route 128 corridor.[251] Six Boston television stations are carried by Canadian satellite television provider Bell TV and by cable television providers in Canada.
