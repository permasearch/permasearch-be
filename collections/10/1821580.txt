The song patterns are similar, but is of a different quality, as the warbler's songs is described as richer, with more ringing and a hurried pace.[20] Other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the flicker, Baltimore oriole, grey catbird, and more specifically the peto, peto, peto calls of the tufted titmouse, and whistles of the northern cardinal.[14] Occasionally, the wrens mimic other species, and in Pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the 'mocking wren'.[3]
