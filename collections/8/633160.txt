After Charles has declared he is coming home for his birthday, Kenneth DiLaurentis wants to take Jason and Alison out of town; except Jason wants to stay to finally justify his childhood memories that he has of "Charlie". Spencer and Hanna see this as an opportunity to trap Charles and get the answers they're looking for, while Aria and Emily want to keep him as far away from them as possible. Meanwhile, Mona and Mike's relationship is on rocky terms as Mike believes she is shutting him out, and Hanna receives an undesirable surprise. Charles attacks Toby at an arcade and injures him and Lorenzo. Jason and Alison hear Charles asking Jason to come to the attic, and they run upstairs to see an old video playing of Jason, Alison, and Charles when they were younger. It shows Mrs. DiLaurentis calling Freddie, who is Charles, and it shows Freddie talking to Mrs. DiLaurentis. The video shows Freddie aka Charles blowing out candles at his birthday. Alison reads a note that says "I wanted to trust you" which is from Charles. Jason and Alison are left haunted and confused by the video.
