Due in part to its economic fortunes, Chile has recently become a new magnet for immigrants, mostly from neighboring Argentina, Bolivia and mainly Peru.[117] According to the 2002 national census, Chile's foreign-born population has increased by 75% since 1992.[118] According to an estimate by the Migration and Foreign Residency Department, 317,057 foreigners were living in Chile as of December 2008.[119] Roughly 500,000 of Chileâ€™s population is of full or partial Palestinian origin.[120][121]
