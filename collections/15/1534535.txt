Amunet, originally known as Aya of Alexandria, wife of Hidden Ones founder Bayek of Siwa, was a female member of the Egyptian Order of Assassins during the Hellenistic period of the Egyptian Ptolemaic Dynasty. On 12 August 30 BCE, Amunet infiltrated Cleopatra VII's palace. There, she killed the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt using a venomous asp. By the Renaissance, Amunet was respected as a great Assassin, and a statue of her was placed in the Assassin Sanctuary of Monteriggioni. Around this time, a shrine in her honor was created at the Basilica di San Marco in Venice, Italy. This was first believed to be the actual burial site of the Assassin, until her mummy was found in the same cave as Bayek's mummy. It has since been confirmed that the sarcophagus in Venice did not contain Amunet's remains.[57]
