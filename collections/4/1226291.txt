Dawn and Decker returned to Port Charles in 1991. Dawn made up with her mother and got engaged to Decker. While Decker was a way on business, Ned tried to forge a fake letter to Decker from Dawn. When Dawn found out, she slapped him. Dawn moved in with friend and fellow nursing student Meg Lawson in a condo paid for by Monica. Dawn then became very sick, but then got better around the time Decker returned to town. They were very happy.
