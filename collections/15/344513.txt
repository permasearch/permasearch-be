The Crows had the first two scoring shots of the second term – behinds to Betts and Tom Lynch– but Richmond dominated the rest of the quarter. Tigers' defender Alex Rance provided a pivotal moment three minutes into the term. With the Crows 13 points up and charging into attack, he effected a desperate diving spoil to deny Adelaide captain Taylor Walker on the lead at centre half-forward. Moments later, Riewoldt finally got on the board but he needed some sloppy defending from Adelaide, letting his kick bounce through with no one on the line and Jake Kelly's late lunge ruled ineffective by a score review. Jacob Townsend, who had not played a game in the senior team before round 22, was then awarded a free kick in a marking contest just inside the 50 metre arc, and he converted the set shot to put Richmond within two points. Nineteen-year-old Jack Graham, the youngest player on the field, kicked Richmond's fifth deep in time on. A minute later Martin pushed deep forward and orchestrated a mismatch against Luke Brown, marked and goal for the Tigers' fourth straight to put Richmond nine points up at the main break.[17]
