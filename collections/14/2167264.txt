The spread of a number of key Roman Catholic devotions are due to women in religious institutes. A well-known example is the impact of Margaret Marie Alacoque on the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.[47] Although various devotions to the Sacred heart had been practiced as early as the second century, and Saint John Eudes had written about it shortly before Saint Margaret, her reported 1673 visions of Jesus were instrumental in establishing the modern devotion.[47][48][49][50]
