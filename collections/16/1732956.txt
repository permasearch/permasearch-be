During its four-year run on ABC, Sabrina was the highest-rated series among the network's TGIF line-up. In the 2000â€“2001 season, the show moved to The WB after a negotiation dispute with ABC. While ABC was willing to renew the show for a fifth season, the network was not willing to pay the reported $1.5 million per episode that Viacom Productions, which produced the show, wanted. The WB then picked up the show for a mere $675,000 per episode, but agreed to commit to 44 episodes.
