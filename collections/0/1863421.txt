While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, the third season marked its debut in a 9:30 p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011, airing between the two popular series The Office and 30 Rock.[48][81] Poehler said of the time-slot, "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor."[44] The Parks producers hoped the Office lead-in would bring new viewers, and so the season premiere "Go Big or Go Home" included an introductory sequence that described the previous events of the series.[82] In some cases, "Producer's Cut" versions of third-season episodes were made available on the official NBC website after they were broadcast. These cuts were about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations. The episodes to receive "Producer's Cuts" included "Harvest Festival",[59][83] "The Fight"[84] and "Li'l Sebastian".[85]
