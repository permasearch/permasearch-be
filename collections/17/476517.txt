A phased approach to investment decisions for development arose in large-scale projects for mechanical and chemical engineering, particularly since the 1940s.[citation needed] One source described eight phases.[2] In 1958, the American Association of Cost Engineers created four standard cost estimate type classifications to match these development and approval phases.[3] Other industries with complex products and projects picked up on the process. For example, NASA practiced the concept of phased development in the 1960s with its phased project planning or what is often called phased review process. The phased review process was intended to break up the development of any project into a series of phases that could be individually reviewed in sequence. Review points at the end of each phase required that a number of criteria be met before the project could progress to the next phase.[4] The phased review process consisted of five phases with periodic development reviews between phases.[5] NASA's phased review process is considered a first generation process because it did not take into consideration the analysis of external markets in new product development.[4]
