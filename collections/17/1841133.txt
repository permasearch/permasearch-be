The middle movement is in the dominant key of A major and includes many scale passages as well as counterpoint. Mozart uses harmonic exploration throughout the sonata such as suspensions and dissonances. There are some chromatic elements in this movement, as is common in many of Mozart's later works. Diminished chords are used to help modulate frequently and a series of keys are cadenced into. These harmonies can also allow more melodic techniques to be used.[5]
