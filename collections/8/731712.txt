Later in the Second Age, Sauron gave the Nine to powerful men, "kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old".[3] All of them fell under the rings' dominance, and they became the Nazg√ªl (Ringwraiths), spirits of terror whom Sauron could command even without the One. Their lives were extended indefinitely by the rings, and they became Sauron's chief servants.
