On 16 August 2005, West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 stalls while cruising and crashes in rural Venezuela during a thunderstorm. Investigations revealed there were no faults with the engines; rather, pilot error led to the stall which was misinterpreted by the pilots, who took no recovery action until it was too late.
