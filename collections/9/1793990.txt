Napoleon was born the same year the Republic of Genoa, a former commune of Italy,[18] transferred Corsica to France.[19] The state ceded sovereign rights a year before his birth in 1768, was transferred to France during the year of his birth and formally incorporated as a province in 1770, after 200 years under nominal Genoese rule.[note 3] His father was an attorney who went on to be named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[24] Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years. Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.[25]
