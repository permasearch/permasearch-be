In the Season 6 opener "Escape From the Citadel", Finn has lost half of his right arm, up to his elbow, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode "Breezy", only to lose it once more in the seventh series finale "Reboot" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the Season 8 premiere episode "Two Swords", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, to replace the missing arm.
