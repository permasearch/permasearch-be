For 2012, the No. 36 team returned full-time with Blaney behind the wheel, with Ryan Pemeberton joining the team as crew chief.[30][31] The team lost most of its sponsorship from the prior year, with Ollie's Bargain Outlet coming on for four of the first six races.[32] The No. 36 teams owners points were also transferred to the No. 10 car for the season, leaving the team with the 44th-place points from the No. 35 car which would not guarantee a spot in the first five races. The team nearly won the Daytona 500, staying out under a caution to gain the lead before the race was red-flagged when Juan Pablo Montoya's car collided with a Jet-dryer cleanup vehicle, damaging the racetrack. The race was ultimately restarted, with Blaney scoring a solid 15th-place finish.[11] The team would later sign SealWrap, a partner of Dave and son Ryan Blaney, and Widow Wax for eight races, while Golden Corral would return for the remaining three restrictor plate races. Blaney earned the No. 36 team a spot in the Top 35 after five races. Though the team had to start and park several events, they remained in the top 35 throughout the entirety of the season. Tony Raines and J. J. Yeley would run single races in the car, while Blaney was in the No. 37 car.
