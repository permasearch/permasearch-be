Bogart's father, Belmont, was a cardiopulmonary surgeon. His mother, Maud, was a commercial illustrator who received her art training in New York and France, including study with James McNeill Whistler. Later she became art director of the fashion magazine The Delineator and a militant suffragette.[18] She used a drawing of baby Humphrey in a well-known advertising campaign for Mellins Baby Food.[19] In her prime, she made over $50,000 a year, then a vast sum and far more than her husband's $20,000.[20] The Bogarts lived in a fashionable Upper West Side apartment, and had an elegant cottage on a 55-acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in upstate New York. As a youngster, Humphrey's gang of friends at the lake would put on theatricals.[21]
