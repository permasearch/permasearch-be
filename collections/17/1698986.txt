where the best-fit constants are as defined above plus also      E  0 s   = 0.3337 ×  10  6     J/kg    {\displaystyle E_{0s}=0.3337\times 10^{6}{\text{ J/kg}}}   and      c  v s   = 1861   J/kg/K    {\displaystyle c_{vs}=1861{\text{ J/kg/K}}}  . Here,       RH   s     {\displaystyle {\text{RH}}_{s}}   is the initial relative humidity of the air parcel with respect to solid water (i.e., ice).
