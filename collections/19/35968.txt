Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphoanhydridic bond is a highly exergonic process. The amount of released energy depends on the conditions in a particular cell. Specifically, the energy released is dependent on concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi. The further the concentrations are from equilibrium the greater the absolute value of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) will be. In standard conditions ( ATP, ADP and Pi concentrations are equal to 1M, water concentration is equal to 55M) the value of ΔG is between -28 to -34 kJ/mol.[3][4]
