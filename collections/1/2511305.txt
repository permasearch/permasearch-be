The ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time.[10][11] Examples of this type of variability include the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmopshere[12][13] and/or by altering the cloud/water vapor/sea ice distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the earth.[14][15]
