In 2002, Iran published a detailed report named TAKFA (Barnameye Tose-e va Karborde Fanavaie Etelaâ€™at) in which it was predicted that most of the government bodies would try to virtualize their services as soon as possible. However, based on the reports by UN bodies, Iran has failed in the recent years to meet the average standards of EG. In 2008, the Supreme Council of Information released a report which criticized the government for its poor advancement in employing new communication technologies for administration purposes.[62]
