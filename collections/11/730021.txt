Education has been an important area of advancement for women in the region, and is a significant path for their advancement toward wider equality. Since the 1990s, women in the region have made advances in access to literacy, education, university enrolment, and the range of subjects of study available to them.[20] In Saudi Arabia, for example, three educational institutions started to permit women to study law in 2007. However, they remain prohibited from serving as lawyers and judges in court and are only allowed to act as legal consultants to other women.[20] Despite these improvements, there are still many barriers to gender equality in education. In majority countries studied, universities largely remain segregated by gender.[20] In Saudi Arabia, for example, the number and diversity of classes offered to men are much greater than those available to women.[20]
