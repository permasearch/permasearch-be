No Man's Sky was first revealed at the VGX Awards in December 2013, and subsequently gained significant attention from the gaming press.[38][39][40][41] Hello Games sought help from a publisher and got the interest of Sony Interactive Entertainment (then Sony Computer Entertainment). Sony offered to provide development funding but Hello Games only requested financial assistance for promotion and publication.[42] Sony presented the game at their media event during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 (E3); until that point, no independently-developed game has been demonstrated during these centre-stage events.[35][36]
