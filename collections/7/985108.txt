Anorexia nervosa is highly heritable.[41] Twin studies have shown a heritability rate of between 28 and 58%.[42] First degree relative of those with anorexia have roughly 12 times the risk of developing anorexia.[43] Association studies have been performed, studying 128 different polymorphisms related to 43 genes including genes involved in regulation of eating behavior, motivation and reward mechanics, personality traits and emotion. Consistent associations have been identified for polymorphisms associated with agouti-related peptide, brain derived neurotrophic factor, catechol-o-methyl transferase, SK3 and opioid receptor delta-1.[44] Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may contribute to the development or maintenance of anorexia nervosa, though clinical research in this area is in its infancy.[45]
