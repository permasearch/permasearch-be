Swat Valley in Pakistan has many Buddhist carvings, and stupas, and Jehanabad contains a Seated Buddha statue.[30] Kushan era Buddhist stupas and statues in Swat valley were demolished after two attempts by the Taliban and the Jehanabad Buddha's face was dynamited.[31][32][33] Only the Buddhas of Bamiyan were larger than the carved giant Buddha statues in Swat near Mangalore which the Taliban attacked.[34] The government did nothing to safeguard the statue after the initial attempts to destroy the Buddha, which did not cause permanent harm. But when a second attack took place on the statue, the feet, shoulders, and face were demolished.[35] Islamists such as the Taliban, and looters, destroyed many of Pakistan's Buddhist artifacts from the Buddhist Gandhara civilization especially in the Swat Valley.[36] The Taliban deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction.[37] The Christian Archbishop of Lahore, Lawrence John Saldanha, wrote a letter to Pakistan's government denouncing the Taliban's activities in Swat Valley including their destruction of Buddha statues and their attacks on Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus.[38] Gandhara Buddhist artifacts were illegally looted by smugglers.[39] A group of Italians helped repair the Buddha.[40]
