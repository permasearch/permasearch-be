The stadium hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the 2001 World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees. The Diamondbacks won all four home games, winning the world championship in seven games, and thus denying the Yankees a fourth consecutive championship. It was the first time since 1991 that the home team won all home games of a World Series. The only other incident was 1987, both by the Minnesota Twins.
