The Myxozoa, microscopic parasites, were first classified as protozoans.[30] Research then suggested that Polypodium hydriforme, a parasite within the egg cells of sturgeon, is closely related to the Myxozoa and that both Polypodium and the Myxozoa were intermediate between cnidarians and bilaterian animals.[31] More recent research demonstrated that the previous identification of bilaterian genes reflected contamination of the Myxozoan samples by material from their host organism, and they are now firmly identified as heavily derived cnidarians, and more closely related to Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa than to Anthozoa.[32] [6] [28]
