Played by Siddharth Thakkar,Karan is typically a self-centered, non-studious, outgoing, immature boy. He is 10 minutes older than his twin Kabir, which he uses against him â€“ often forcing him to do some sort of job that he doesn't want to do. He has a big crush on Vinnie, the candy counter girl at the hotel. He is the equivalent of Zack Martin in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.
