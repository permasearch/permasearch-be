One sort of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships (doctor to patient; firefighter to citizen, etc.).  Under this general justification, persons have a duty to rescue other persons in distress by virtue of their common humanity, regardless of the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress.
