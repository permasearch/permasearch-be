Whitechapel was commissioned for a third series in March 2011, but unlike the previous two series, which were each based on a single event, the new series was split into three separate two-part stories, which each focused on a different case. For the BBC America DVD releases, the three stories was given individual titles: The Murder in Darkness, The Hunger for Mercy and The Sins of Betrayal respectively.[citation needed]
