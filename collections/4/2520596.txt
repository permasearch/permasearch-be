On June 10, 2014, Fisher was hired by the New York Knicks to be the team's head coach, signing a five-year, $25 million deal. Fisher said his relationship with Jackson, who had become the president of the Knicks, was a major factor in his decision to join the team.[54][55] Fisher planned for the Knicks to run the  triangle offense, which he learned while with the Lakers under Jackson.  During the offseason, he helped the Knicks re-recruit  and re-sign free agent Carmelo Anthony, whom Fisher believed could adapt to the new offense. On October 29, Fisher made his coaching debut where the team lost their 2014–15 season opener to the Chicago Bulls 104–80. On October 30, Fisher won his first game as a head coach after the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 95–90.[56] The Knicks ended the season with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[57]
