Gadget dresses in a style similar to Inspector Clouseau from The Pink Panther movies, but also has similarities in behavior to Maxwell Smart, the protagonist of the television series Get Smart (1965-1970). The original voice actor for Gadget was Don Adams, who also portrayed Maxwell Smart.[9] The car which Gadget drives is recognizable as a Matra Murena.[9]
