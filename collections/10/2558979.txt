The independence of Czechoslovakia was officially proclaimed in Prague on 28 October 1918[6] in Smetana Hall of the Municipal House, a physical setting strongly associated with nationalist feeling. The Slovaks officially joined the state two days later in the town of Martin. A temporary constitution was adopted, and Tomáš Masaryk was declared president on 14 November.[1] The Treaty of St. Germain, signed in September 1919, formally recognized the new republic.[7] Ruthenia was later added to the Czech lands and Slovakia by the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920.[8] There were also various border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia due to the anexion of Zaolzie region.
