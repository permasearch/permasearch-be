The Saint of Killers first appeared as a heartless murderer, who is transformed into the Angel of Death under the condition that he takes up the role of collecting the souls of those who die by violence. Following his reanimation, Heaven arranged for him to be put into a deep slumber, until he was needed to kill people. The Saint was a primary antagonist in the Preacher series, who is tasked by Heaven to kill protagonist Jesse Custer due to his possession of the entity Genesis.[9] Aside from Ennis and Dillon's Preacher, the Saint was featured in his own four-issue limited series, Preacher: Saint of Killers, which expanded on the Saint's background and motivation,[10] and has appeared briefly in the DC Comics series Hitman, centered on a "wise-cracking assassin plying his trade in Gotham City",[7] and is portrayed by Graham McTavish in the television series adaptation of Preacher.[11]
