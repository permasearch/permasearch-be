The price war with Texas Instruments was seen as a personal battle for Commodore president Jack Tramiel.[23] Commodore dropped the C64's list price by $200 within two months after its release.[7] In June 1983 the company lowered the price to $300, and some stores sold the computer for $199. At one point, the company was selling as many C64s as all computers sold by the rest of the industry combined, while TI lost money by selling the 99/4A for $99.[24] TI's subsequent demise in the home computer industry in October 1983 was seen as revenge for TI's tactics in the electronic calculator market in the mid-1970s, when Commodore was almost bankrupted by TI.[25]
