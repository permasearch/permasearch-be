Chinese authorities looked upon the show unfavourably, asserting that it was spreading the 'wrong values'. State media editorialized against the show on television, in print, and online.[5] Six months after the show first aired, officials from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stepped in to regulate the show. From that point forward, Fei Cheng Wu Rao was to curb mentions of financial wealth and sex, and a third host was added: a party school psychology teacher named Huang Han, who was seen to 'balance' the show to make it more grounded and less controversial as well as adding more banter between the three hosts.[5] A wholesale replacement of the contestant pool with more tame individuals followed.[3] The revised program scrubbed contestant information such as bank account information and salaries etc. Also omitted is the 'final opinions' on a departing male contestant from the women; previously this part of the show was especially prone to pointed insults and ridicule. Moreover, the original reel of the show must undergo heavy editing before airing depending on length and number of contestants present.[3] Despite the changed format, the show remains extremely popular.
