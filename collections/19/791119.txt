In 1934 Whiteman had his last two No. 1 hits, "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", with vocals by Bob Lawrence, which was No. 1 for six weeks, and "Wagon Wheels", which was #1 for one week, his final number one pop hit. From 1920 to 1934 Whiteman had 32 No. 1 recordings, charting 28 of them by 1929. By contrast, during the same period, the 1920s Jazz Age, Louis Armstrong had none.[citation needed]
