When Koki and Jimmy get stranded in the desert, Aviva and the Kratt brothers must rely on the serendipitous trail of Jimmy's lost seed collection to lead them to their friends. But when the Mexican jumping bean trai becomes broken by some unsuspecting creatures inside them, the gang must rely on the eyes, ears and powers of the "desert elves", the owl, to find their friends in the harsh desert habitat. They realized it is an elf owl underground and a elf owl that lives inside a cactus.
