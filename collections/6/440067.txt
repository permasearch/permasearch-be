During the prehistoric eras the vast steppes of Southern Russia were home to tribes of nomadic pastoralists. In classical antiquity, the Pontic Steppe was known as Scythia.[8] Remnants of these long gone steppe cultures were discovered in the course of the 20th century in such places as Ipatovo,[8] Sintashta,[9] Arkaim,[10] and Pazyryk.[11]
