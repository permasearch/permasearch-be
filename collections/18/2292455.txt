Vernita Green, a.k.a. Copperhead (portrayed by Vivica A. Fox), is a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who took part in the massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel. She is second on The Bride's "Death List Five". Four years after the massacre, she is depicted living a normal life under the alias of Jeannie Bell. She is trained in hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting, and it is hinted that she and The Bride share a mutual, professional respect for each other. At the start of the first movie, they engage in a vicious fight, destroying Vernita's living room in the process. However, the fight is interrupted when Green's four-year-old daughter, Nikki, arrives home from school in the middle of the fight, and they stop fighting because The Bride does not wish to kill Vernita in front of her child. Green sends Nikki to her room and she talks with The Bride over coffee, apologizing for betraying her and asking for mercy on behalf of her daughter and family, The Bride coldly refuses and they agree to meet in the middle of the night to have a knife fight. However, Vernita betrays her promise, and shoots at The Bride with a handgun concealed within a box of Kaboom cereal. She misses, and The Bride throws a knife into Vernita's heart, killing her instantly. Nikki unintentionally witnesses her mother's death, for which The Bride apologizes. Before leaving, The Bride then adds that, when Nikki grows up, if she ever wants to avenge her mother's death she'll be waiting for her.
