Cathedral hulls became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when the use of fiberglass made economical production of this hull-form possible. The undesirable aspects of the cathedral hull are greater weight and cost, pounding in rough water, and a boxy appearance. Their advantages include high waterplane area at rest (good initial stability) a dry ride in light chop, and reasonable fuel economy at planing speeds. In exposed waters this hullform has been almost totally replaced by the modified-vee and deep-vee hull forms. After a period of reduced popularity, they live on in modified form as "deck boats" which are very popular in the inland lakes and rivers.
