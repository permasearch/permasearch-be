"Heaven Is a Place on Earth" plays at the beginning of the episode, and over the end credits. Brooker first heard it while running, and knew it would be perfect for the final scene, admitting in an interview he would have been "absolutely distraught" if they were unable to use it.[10] "Girlfriend in a Coma" features in the episode "for about five seconds", yet cost "an outrageous amount of money! It was like shoveling bank notes into a fire", according to Brooker. Executive producer Annabel Jones notes that "it was indulgent but at the same time, it was so important that we set up that era so it felt different".[17] The song "C'est La Vie" by Robbie Nevil was chosen by Harris; it was "one of the first singles that [he] ever bought".[11]
