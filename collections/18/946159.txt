The background represents the Earth and the local view of the sky.  The blue circle directly in the centre represents the Earth, and the upper blue is the portion of the sky which is above the horizon.  The red and black areas indicate portions of the sky below the horizon.  During the daytime, the Sun sits over the blue part of the background and at night it sits over the black. During dawn or dusk, the mechanical sun is positioned over the red part of the background.
