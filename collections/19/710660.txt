Named after Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, the Tasman Manx is a tailless or partially tailed Manx cat with a curly-haired coat not unlike that of a Selkirk Rex, due a recessive mutation which arose in Manx litters in both Australia and New Zealand. As of March 2013[update], the breed is only recognised by the NZCF[33] and the Catz Inc. registry[34]:222â€“227 (also of New Zealand) with breed standards. The coat may be short or semi-long.
