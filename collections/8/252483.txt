In excavations during the 2010-2014 renovations of the cathedral, ninth-century foundations of the St. Mary's chapel were found.[11] The first cathedral building was a small church measuring 6 x 6 m with an apse to the east. The remains of the first altar were found in the apse. The foundations of this first cathedral building consist of sandstone and are extraordinarily thick.[12]
