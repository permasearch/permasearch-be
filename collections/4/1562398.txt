While coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to wheat proteins, it is not the same as a wheat allergy.[75][74] Other diseases triggered by eating gluten are non-coeliac gluten sensitivity,[75][14] (estimated to affect 0.5% to 13% of the general population),[76] gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis.[14]
