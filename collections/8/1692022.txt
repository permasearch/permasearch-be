The eggs usually hatch in 60â€“85 days, depending on the temperature and the depth of the nest. Hatchlings usually emerge from the nest in August and September, but may overwinter in the nest after hatching.[34] Hatchlings sometimes stay on land in the nesting areas in both fall and spring and they may remain terrestrial for much or all of the winter in some places.[32][35] Hatchling terrapins are freeze tolerant,[34] which may facilitate overwintering on land. Hatchlings have lower salt tolerance than adults and Gibbons et al.[23] provided strong evidence that one- and two-year-old terrapins use different habitats than do old individuals.
