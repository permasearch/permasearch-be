Composer Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, and Dead Again, was hired to produce the music for Sense and Sensibility.[93] Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new "gentle" melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film's events.[94][95] He explained, "You had this middle-class English motif, and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion."[93] Doyle explains that the score "becomes a little more grown-up" as the story progresses to one of "maturity and an emotional catharsis."[95] The score contains romantic elements[96][97] and has been described by National Public Radio as a "restricted compass ... of emotion" with "instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way".[98] They also noted that as a reflection of the story, the score is a "little wistful ... and sentimental."[98]
