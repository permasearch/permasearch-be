The FaZe Clan began its existence through YouTube in 2010. FaZe started as a clan that would perform trick shots in Call of Duty and post clips and montages on YouTube. As the members' personalities and audience preferences changed, so did the video content. The FaZe YouTubers—including FaZe Banks, FaZe Apex, FaZe Blaze, FaZe Rug, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Censor, and FaZe Rain—started to vlog and do creative skits to further develop their channels. Although the FaZe YouTubers are the more famous FaZe Clan members, they do not compete in any competitive gaming for FaZe. These YouTubers strictly make YouTube videos in order to extend the FaZe Clan brand and entertain their fans. Currently, each major FaZe member has over 1 million subscribers on YouTube, with some having between three and five million subscribers. The official FaZe Clan YouTube channel has 4.8 million subscribers,[4] while FaZe Rug has the most subscribers out of all the FaZe Members with 8 million subscribers.[5]
