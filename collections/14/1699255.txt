Shoemaker's Holiday, I am sure I did NOT use the term "ghetto" or "ghettoising." Furthermore, the "Criticism" section already exists--I am merely suggesting that given the existence of the section, the unbalanced criticism would be more appropriate there. 2/0, your line-by-line is duly noted and appreciated. As my schedule permits, I hope to respond in-kind with sourced material. My general concern remains however that the overall tone of the article is slanted such that the sourced criticism is treated as authority rather than as opinion. Even if the criticism remains unbalanced with equally weighted positive viewpoints, the wording could be improved to clarify that the criticism is opinion rather than accepted wisdom.
