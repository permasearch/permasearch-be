In Taihoku, at around 2:30 PM as the bomber with Bose on board was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring.[70][71]  The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane.[72]  It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller.[72][70]  The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames.[72][70] Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria,[73] were instantly killed.[72][74]  Bose's assistant Habibur Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline.[72]  When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door, but found it blocked by the luggage.[74]  They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front.[74]  The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch.[72]  The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited.[74] Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned.[74]  According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, "A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku."[72]  The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3 PM.[74] Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter.[75]  Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting very much that he would live.[75]  Dr. Yoshimi promptly began to treat Bose and was assisted by Dr. Tsuruta.[75]  According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, who interviewed all the hospital personnel later,
