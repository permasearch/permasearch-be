Peer education has seemed to improve sexual health outcomes by having positive effects on sexual health knowledge, intentions, and attitudes. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of peers intervening via text messaging to promote sexual health. Studies showed that 88% of American teens (ages 13â€“17) had access to a mobile phone of some kind in 2015. The, It's Okay to Ask Someone (IOTAS) app, was created in 2014 with funding form the Forbes Fun and curricula collaboration with the Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania (PPWP) Education Department. The app's main purpose was to serves as a sexual health text line that would reach beyond the classroom, in which peer educators could participate in by responding to students questions with adult oversight. The PPWP Education Department made sure that the peer educators received appropriate training for answering sexual health question and navigating the app; they developed an 8-lesson student curriculum. The app was then launched in four high schools in western Pennsylvania in which peer educators answered student questions. IOTAS was successful and deemed to be time-effective in answering questions all while upholding the confidentiality of sexual health information beyond the classroom. It also allowed the peer educators to be more involved in their communities and expand their own sexual health knowledge, thus is was great for both those who were receiving and getting the information.[28]
