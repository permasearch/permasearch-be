Bethlehem became a center of heavy industry and trade during the industrial revolution. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation (1857â€“2003), founded and based in Bethlehem, was once the second-largest steel producer in the United States, after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based U.S. Steel. Bethlehem Steel was also one of the largest shipbuilding companies in the world and one of the most powerful symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership.
