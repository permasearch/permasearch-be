In October 2011, Alan Mulholland, the former Under-21 manager, was appointed as Senior manager as Ã“ Flatharta's replacement. The 2012 season saw a vast improvement for the team from the FBD League right through to the League quarter-final which saw wins over Derry, Meath and Monaghan, two defeats by Westmeath and Tyrone, and two draws against Louth and Kildare after extra-time. They had an impressive start to the Connacht Championship beating Roscommon comfortably by 3-15 to 0-10. This promising start to the championship proved a false dawn however, as the semi-final saw Sligo run out winners, by a margin 2-15 to 0-16, with the two goals coming from Adrian Marren. Galway were knocked out of the 2012 championship by Antrim, which raised many questions about the structures and organisation of football in the county and how the county had fallen back, having been a power in the game ten years previously.
