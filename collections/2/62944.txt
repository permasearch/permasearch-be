The Army–Navy game is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football. It has been frequently attended by sitting U.S. presidents.[1] The game has been nationally televised each year since 1945 on either ABC, CBS or NBC. CBS has televised the game since 1996 and has the rights to the broadcast through 2028.[2] Instant replay made its American debut in the 1963 Army–Navy game.[3] Since 2009, the game has been held the Saturday following FBS conference championship weekend.[4]
