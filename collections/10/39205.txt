The collections have also received praise. IGN (9.4/10) awarded God of War Collection (PS3) the "Editor's Choice" Award and praised the enhanced resolutions, lower price point and smoother frame rates, and stated it was the "definitive way to play the game[s]".[159] Due to the success of God of War Collection, Sony announced that further titles would receive similar treatment for release under its new "Classics HD" brand.[17] The Origins Collection was similarly well received. IGN (9/10) stated "Sony succeeded at making good games better",[160] although GamePro criticized it for its lack of new bonus content.[161] God of War Saga also received praise. Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends wrote that the collection "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available," although the collection is not likely for fans of the series, but rather inexperienced players or newcomers.[162] God of War III Remastered was met with generally favorable reception. Praise was given to the smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because the original already had remarkable graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.[163]
