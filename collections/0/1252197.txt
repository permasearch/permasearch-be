Regarded as a five-star recruit by both the Rivals.com and Scout.com recruiting networks, Peterson was listed as the No. 1 running back and overall prospect in the Class of 2004 by Rivals.com.[20] After considering schools such as Texas, Texas A&M, UCLA, Arkansas, and Miami (FL),[21] he decided that he wanted to go to a school where he could be a difference-maker in a national championship run and narrowed his choices down to USC and Oklahoma.[9] Concluding his high school football career at the annual U.S. Army All-American Bowl, he led the West squad with 95 yards on nine carries and scored two touchdowns, and announced at the game that he would attend college at the University of Oklahoma.[22] Following his senior season, he was awarded the Hall Trophy as the U. S. Army National Player of the Year.[22] In addition, he was named the top high school player by College Football News and Rivals.com.[13]
