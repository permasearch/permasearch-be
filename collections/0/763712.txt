On Monday 17 March, Sally announces that Bill has recovered and that Kevin will be returning later in the week, with his son Jack. The following day, he phones his house tenants Stella Price (Michelle Collins), Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Eva moves out to live with her boyfriend Jason, leaving a spare bedroom for Kevin and Jack. Kevin arrives in a taxi, while Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) invites him into The Kabin for a cup of tea and a chat. When Kevin and Jack are inside Rita's flat, Sophie's friend Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly) steals one of their bags with their iPod, camera and Jack's clothes inside. Kevin later spots a man in Sally's house, who turns out to be her boyfriend Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). Mistaking Tim for a burglar, Kevin attacks him, but Sally turns up and reveals who he is. Kevin later goes to visit Tyrone and invites him and Jack to stay at his house until Stella and Leanne find somewhere else. Kevin then returns to work full-time at the garage.
