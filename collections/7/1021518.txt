The four first parables (on to Matthew 13:34) "were spoken in presence of the multitude, and the other three again within the circle of the disciples".[2] German liberal Protestant theologian David Strauss thought this chapter was "overwhelming with parables".[3] At the beginning of the chapter, Jesus sits in a ship or a boat on the Sea of Galilee and addresses the crowd who stand on the shore or the beach.[4] The Textus Receptus has inserted the definite article, (Greek: τὸ πλοῖον, to ploion), suggesting that there was a boat kept waiting for him,[5] but other texts do not include the definite article and the Pulpit Commentary therefore argues that it was "wrongly inserted".[6]
