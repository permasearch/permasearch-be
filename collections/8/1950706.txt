It is possible to give the expression x < y < z its familiar mathematical meaning, and some programming languages such as Python and Perl 6 do that. Others, such as C# and Java, do not, partly because it would differ from the way most other infix operators work in C-like languages. The D programming language do not do that since it maintains some compatibility with C, and "Allowing C expressions but with subtly different semantics (albeit arguably in the right direction) would add more confusion than convenience".[4]
