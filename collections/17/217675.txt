Crosby left money in her will for "the sheltering of senior males who had no other place to live, with these men to pay a nominal fee to the home for their living expenses".[336] In 1923, the King's Daughters of the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport, Connecticut honored Crosby's request to memorialize her by beginning to raise the additional funds needed to establish the Fanny Crosby Memorial Home for the Aged.[337] The non-denominational home was established in the former Hunter house at 1008 Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport;[338] it opened on November 1, 1925 after a national drive by the Federation of Churches to raise $100,000 to operate it.[339] It operated until 1996 when it was given to the Bridgeport Rescue Mission.[340]
