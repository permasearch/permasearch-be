Since Florida's first season in 1906, eighty-nine players have received one or more selections as first-team All-Americans.[13] This includes thirty-two consensus All-Americans, of which six were unanimous.[124]  The first Florida first-team All-American was end Dale Van Sickel, a member of the 1928 team.[125] Florida's first consensus All-American was quarterback Steve Spurrier, the winner of the Heisman Trophy for the 1966 Gators.[13][126]
