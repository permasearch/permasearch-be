Clarke was born in the year of 2131 and raised on the Ark to Jake and Abigail Griffin. Before her imprisonment, Clarke's father discovered that the Ark space station was running out of oxygen, and had an estimated 6 months worth left. He shared this information with Clarke and planned on going public with the information, only to have Abigail report him to the Chancellor in fears it might scare the public after the Chancellor ordered him not to. He was later 'floated', an act in which he is put in an airlock room and the oxygen is released, thus killing him. Clarke acting as an accomplice was imprisoned for treason instead of being 'floated', because she was under the age of 18. Because of her status of prisoner she was considered to be expendable by the council and was volunteered by her mother to be sent down to Earth to test the air to see if it was livable again with 98 other delinquents.
