The "yeah, yeah, yeah" refrain proved an immediate, effective, infectious musical hook.[12][13] Unusually, the song starts with the hook right away, instead of introducing it after a verse or two.[13] "She Loves You" does not include a bridge, instead using the refrain to join the various verses. The chords tend to change every two measures, and the harmonic scheme is mostly static.
