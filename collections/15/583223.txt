Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan commanded Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt.[114] Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18,[115] but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing.[116] Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.[114]
