The song whose lyrics are described just above is widely attributed to Ronald Blackwell.[5] There seems to be no controversy (although various titles are occasionally used) that one with a similar title was earlier written and recorded by the Big Bopper, and released as "Little Red Riding Hood" (N.B.: with "little" spelled out) late in 1958 as the B-side of his second hit.[6] The searchable sites with its complete lyrics as text seem to constitute no more than a handful,[7][8][9][10] but a recording, purported to be of his voice[11] and thus presumably as being authoritative as to lyrics, exists online.
