These are powered by a naturally aspirated 6.3L V12 producing 444 PS (438 hp/327 kW). This engine is based on the M137 5.8L V12 used in the S600 and CL600, but the AMG variants have a larger displacement, a new management system, a new crank case and cooling system, weight-optimized pistons, and a new camshaft with greater valve lift and modified valves. 390 lb·ft (530 N·m) of torque are available between 2500–5800rpm with a peak of 457 at 4400 rpm while horsepower grows by almost 80 over the 5.8L V12. It is mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2001 S63 AMG V12 had 100 hp more than the 2001 S55 AMG, and was a few tenths faster.[52][53]
