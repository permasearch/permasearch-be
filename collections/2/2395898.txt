During the Pit Stop, all teams were moved to Hilton Bora Bora Nui to start the leg of the race. The first Detour of the race was a choice of Pick a Pearl and Take a Trunk, and both Detours required racers to pick up a pair of water shoes and snorkeling gear. In Pick a Pearl, teams traveled to a point half-mile off-shore in the open water where they had to dive and untie lines of pearl oysters. They had to shuck (open) them to find two red pearls and then swim to an oyster farmer, where they could trade the red pearls for the next clue. In Take a Trunk, teams dove underwater, wearing special diving helmets, to look for a series of treasure trunks. They then had to take a trunk over to a submerged umbrella and unpack its contents, setting up an underwater picnic table to receive the waiter's approval. Once they done so, they receive their next clue.
