Jane’s red herd is rustled shortly afterward and Venters tracks it and returns it to Jane. In the process, he wages a gun battle with two of Oldring’s rustlers, killing one and wounding Oldring’s notorious Masked Rider. When he removes the mask and shirt of the wounded rider, he discovers that she is a young woman named Bess, who was probably abused by Oldring. Venters feels very guilty about shooting a woman, and decides that it is his duty to save her.[7]
