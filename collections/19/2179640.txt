Damage to the axillary artery[9] and axillary nerve (C5,C6) may result. The axillary nerve is injured in 37% making it the most commonly injured structure with this type of injury.[10] Other common, associated, nerve injuries include injury to the suprascapular nerve (29%) and the radial nerve (22%).[10]  Axillary nerve damage results in a weakened or paralyzed deltoid muscle and as the deltoid atrophies unilaterally, the normal rounded contour of the shoulder is lost. A patient with injury to the axillary nerve will have difficulty in abducting the arm from approximately 15Â° away from the body. The supraspinatus muscle initiates abduction from a fully adducted position.
