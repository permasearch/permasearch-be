As Taylor went to Las Vegas for the 2008 Las Vegas Desert Classic in July, he was in the unusual position (for him) of not holding any major televised ranking events. He quickly addressed this by winning his fourth Las Vegas Desert Classic title. Taylor then went on to win the World Matchplay,[58] World Grand Prix,[59] the inaugural European Darts Championship,[60][61] and the Grand Slam of Darts.[62][63]
