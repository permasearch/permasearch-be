For example, the word "睡" (to sleep) is an intransitive verb, but may express different meaning when coupled with objects of prepositions such as "to sleep with." However, in Mandarin, "睡" is usually coupled with a pseudo-character "觉," yet it isn't entirely a cognate object, to express the act of resting.
