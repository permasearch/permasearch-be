As of 2013, New Jersey's 21 counties are divided into 565 municipalities. Each municipality is located in exactly one county; there are no independent cities or consolidated city-counties. There is no unincorporated territory in the state, making New Jersey one of the few states outside New England in which every square foot is incorporated.  Title 40 of the New Jersey Statutes provides the state's municipalities to be incorporated under five types (city, town, township, borough and village), with twelve forms of management. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that New Jersey has 250 boroughs, 52 cities, 15 towns, 244 townships, and 4 villages.[13] Several municipalities continue to operate under special charters that do not conform with the government formats prescribed by the current statutes.  New Jersey's municipalities range in population from towns with from small single-digit or double-digit populations (as in Tavistock or Walpack Township) or cities in which of several hundred thousand persons reside (such as Newark, Paterson or Trenton).
