The lyrics of "Fairly Local" are about how Joseph refuses to let others label him as "evil to the core" or "emotional"â€”a reference to depression and angst. He accepts that he has problems that he needs to work through and that his audience may have some of these issues as well. After welcoming that audience to join him in discovering truth, he claims ability to know himself and to do what's right.
