This composition is in the key of D-flat Major, but makes extensive use of the secondary dominant chords, secondary ii窶天窶的 progressions, diatonic circle of fifths, and evaded cadences.[2] The song is extremely chromatic and complex, employing sophisticated mathematics that were rare at this time in jazz:[3] Ellington's rising semitones (G-G#-A-A#-B) at the end of the bridge mirror the opening of both A sections (B-A#-A-G#-G).
