The Danish government was harshly criticized for inadequate laws in regard to sexual violence in a 2008 report produced by Amnesty International.[86] The Danish criminal provisions regarding sexual crimes had remained nearly unchanged for 30 years, which lead Amnesty International to declare that "legislation on rape and sexual violence [conflicted] with human rights principles concerning the need to protect an individual's sexual and physical integrity and right to self-determination."[87] The organization repeatedly urged Denmark to bring legislation on rape in line with international law over several years,[88] which lead to an amendment to the sexual offences code in 2013, following a change in government after the 2011 elections.[89][90]
