In Toy Story 2, Woody is preparing to go with Andy to Cowboy Camp, but his arm is accidentally ripped and Andy decides not to take him to camp. Woody is shelved and fears the worst for his fate. A squeaky toy Penguin named Wheezy is also on the shelf with a broken squeaker. Andy's Mom holds a yard sale and marks Wheezy to be sold for 25 cents. Woody saves Wheezy with help from Andy's new puppy, Buster. Woody, however, gets stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al. At his apartment, Woody discovers his forgotten past and legacy as the star of a 1950s Western children's show "Woody's Roundup", but learns that he will be shipped to Japan to be displayed in a toy museum. Even worse, one of the toys from the franchise, Stinky Pete the Prospector, is intent to make sure that Woody and the rest of the "Roundup" toys get to Japan. It is revealed that Stinky Pete was never sold and had never experienced the love of a child for decades. Al then calls a restoration expert to fix Woody's right arm. After that Stinky Pete convinces Woody to go along with the plan after Buzz and a few of the toys from the first film arrive to rescue Woody, who has a change of heart after watching an episode of Woody's Roundup in which he sings "You've Got a Friend in Me". Stinky Pete is able to prevent Woody from leaving by replacing the bolts on the air vent grille through which Buzz and the others managed to get into Al's apartment.
