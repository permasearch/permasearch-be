White Collar and No Collar were neck-and-neck until Shirin from the White Collar tribe struggled on the 50-piece puzzle; the other two tribes found success with the 10-piece puzzle and won immunity. While Shirin seemed to be an easy target for the White Collar tribe's first vote, So decided to target Carolyn for not stepping up to either the ladder releasing or puzzle solving tasks during the challenge; to save herself, Carolyn told Tyler about her idol. So and Joaquin believed that they were in an alliance with Max and Tyler, but Max's true loyalty was with Shirin and Carolyn, who attempted to get Tyler to join them in voting off So. At Tribal Council, Shirin called Joaquin and So out for their lie regarding the clue to the hidden immunity idol, while So admitted that Carolyn was her target, which prompted a heated debate between the two. Tyler ultimately decided to join Carolyn, Max, and Shirin, as So became the first player voted out.
