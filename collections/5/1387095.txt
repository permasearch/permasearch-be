The Turko-Mongol ruler Timur's attack on India was marked by systematic slaughter and other atrocities on a massive scale which were inflicted mainly on the subcontinent's Hindu population.[64] His army looted Delhi, sparing only the Muslim neighbourhoods of the city. The Hindu population was massacred or enslaved.[65] One hundred thousand Hindus prisoners were killed by his army before he attacked Delhi for fear of rebellion and many more were killed afterwards.[66][67][68]
