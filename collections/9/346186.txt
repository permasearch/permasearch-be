In Robert Heinlein's fantasy Glory Road book, a similar magic object â€“ although not a bag, a fold box is a little black box 'about the size and shape of a portable typewriter', that can be opened again and again 'unfolding its sides and letting them down until it is the size of a small moving van' when folded back up it does not weigh more than a few pounds, even though tons of materials may be carried around in it.
