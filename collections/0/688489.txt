The Grand National is a National Hunt handicap race over a distance of 4 miles 3Â½ furlongs and over 30 fences at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool. The high number of equine deaths in the race has made it a target for animal rights activists. While course officials have repeatedly taken safety measures over the years, such as improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of fences,[4] some have campaigned for further modifications or the abolition of the event that was inaugurated in 1839.[5]
