The Irish rugby union team is one of many teams that draws its players from across the Island of Ireland and therefore can contain players from both Ireland ("The Republic") and Northern Ireland. In the past this has led to issues surrounding certain flag and anthem usage. When Irish internationals were played alternately in Belfast and Dublin, the British national anthem "God Save the Queen" was played before matches in Belfast and the national anthem of Ireland "Amhr√°n na bhFiann" was played for matches in Dublin. "God Save the Queen" is no longer played as some Irish players refused to stand for it.[citation needed] No anthem was played at away games. In the 1987 Rugby World Cup, The Rose of Tralee was used as the away anthem.
