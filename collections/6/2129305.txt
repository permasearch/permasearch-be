In his second start at quarterback, Robinson led Michigan to a 28â€“24 win over Notre Dame against its traditional rival. He finished the game with 502 of Michigan's 532 yards of total offense (258 rushing yards and 244 passing yards), breaking the Michigan record he set in his first start.[50][51] The record stood until Devin Gardner totaled 584 yards of total offense on October 19, 2013 against Indiana.[52] In the first half, Robinson had an 87-yard touchdown run that at the time (surpassed on September 19, 2015 by C. J. Prosise)[53] ranked as the longest run from scrimmage in Notre Dame Stadium's 80-year history, but remains as the longest run by a visitor in Notre Dame Stadium.[54] He also scored the winning touchdown with 27 seconds remaining on a two-yard run, capping a 12-play, 72-yard drive.[50] Robinson broke Mike Kafka's Big Ten Conference record for rushing yards by a quarterback and became the ninth quarterback in NCAA history (and the first since Pat White in 2006) to rush and pass for more than 200 yards in a single game.[55][56] His rushing total also ranks as the all-time best in a road game by any Michigan player, regardless of position.[57]
