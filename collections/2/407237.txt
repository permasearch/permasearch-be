Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material (DNA) of the Lyme disease spirochete. PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results from poor laboratory technique.[99] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false negative results with blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens.[100] Hence, PCR is not widely performed for diagnosis of Lyme disease, but it may have a role in the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid.[101]
