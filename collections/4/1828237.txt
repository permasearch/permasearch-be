The practice of imposing longer prison sentences on repeat offenders (versus first-time offenders who commit the same crime) is nothing new, as judges often take into consideration prior offenses when sentencing. However, there is a more recent history of mandatory prison sentences for repeat offenders.[7] For example, New York State had a long-standing Persistent Felony Offender law dating back to the early 20th century[8] (partially ruled unconstitutional in 2010,[9][10] but reaffirmed en banc shortly after[11][12]). But such sentences were not compulsory in each case, and judges had much more discretion as to what term of incarceration should be imposed.
