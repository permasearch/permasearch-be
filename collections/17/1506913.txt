The list ends here because it’s where the decade truly begins."[155] In August 2014, GQ named it the best album of the 21st century.[156] In 2016, Odyssey named it the best album of the decade so far.[157] In 2017, Complex ranked it as West's best album.[158] In October 2017, DJ Booth named it the best Hip-Hop or R&B album of the decade thus far.[159]
