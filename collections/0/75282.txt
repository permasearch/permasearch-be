The theme tune was performed by Lulu, composed by John Barry, and the lyrics to the song were written by Don Black. Alice Cooper claims his song "The Man With The Golden Gun" was to be used by the film's producers until it was dropped for Lulu's song instead. Cooper's song appears on his album Muscle of Love.
