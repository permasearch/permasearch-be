Cascarones were said to be originally invented in Mexico in the mid-1800s by Emperor Maximilianâ€™s wife, but this can not be true. Another rumor says that they were brought from China to Spain and eventually Mexico by Marco Polo. An article about Christmas celebrations published in the Los Angeles Star newspaper on January 4, 1855, includes the sentence, "In the city cascarones commanded a premium, and many were complimented with them as a finishing touch to their head dress." Maximilian and his wife Carlota did not arrive in Mexico until 1864, nine years later. It was in Mexico that the perfumed powder was replaced with confetti.[3]
