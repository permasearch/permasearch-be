Many lever actions have a tubular magazine under the barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rim-fire primers rather than center-fire primers. The safety problem is that long-range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire center-fire cartridges.  A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some lever actions such as the Savage Model 99 can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The Winchester Model 1895 also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for .30-06 and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.[5]
