In his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[10] Night after night, the teenager with the "slim frame" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[10] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[6]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[11] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[12] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[2] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[2]
