By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.[124] Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.[125] Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.[126] The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.[127] Therefore, a massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.
