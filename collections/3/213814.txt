The European Union has a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 MW. Germany has the third largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States) with an installed capacity was 29,060 MW at the end of 2011, and Spain has 21,674 MW. Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW.[66][67] By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW.[68] But energy production can be different from capacity â€“ in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh compared to Germany's 35 TWh.[69]
