Eminem purposely made Infinite's songs "radio-friendly" in hopes of getting on the air on Detroit radio stations.[5] Featured vocalist are fellow rappers Proof, Mr. Porter, Eye-Kyu, Three, and Thyme as well as singer Angela Workman (in the chorus of "Searchin'").[6] Only around a thousand copies of the album were made.[7] Subjects covered in Infinite included his and his grandma's struggles with raising Hailie Jade Mathers, Eminem's newborn daughter while on limited funds and his strong desire to get rich.[2] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol resulted in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.[8] Eminem recalls: "Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, and I got a lot of feedback saying that I sounded like AZ. Infinite was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be, how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like Infinite was like the demo that just got pressed up."[4]
