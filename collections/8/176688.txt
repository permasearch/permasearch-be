In March 2009, Ballinger uploaded a Miranda video called "Free Voice Lesson", full of awful singing advice, that quickly became her first viral sensation.[18][19] This led to requests for Ballinger to perform live as Miranda,[20] and she later began to tour worldwide.[21] The Miranda Sings YouTube channel has received more than 1 billion views and has more than 8 million subscribers,[22][6] while Ballinger's personal YouTube channel, PsychoSoprano, has more than 900 million views and 5 million subscribers.[23] Miranda has appeared in character on television shows[24] and Ballinger released a 2015 book, Selp-Helf, written in Miranda's voice,[25] that ranked No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous.[26]
