On January 23, 2018, in conjunction with the tariffs placed on solar panels, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced tariffs on washing machines.[66] According to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), imports of large residential washers increased "steadily" from 2012 to 2016, and that domestic producersâ€™ financial performance "declined precipitously".[70] In the first year, the tariffs start at twenty percent for the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers, and all subsequent washers within that year will have a fifty percent tariff. By the third year initial tariff will go down to sixteen and forty percent, following the same pattern.
