Four other City owned-and-operated stations use the name and the format (see Breakfast Television), creating content relevant to their own local audiences. When A stations were part of the apparent CHUM Limited company, each station produced their own similar morning shows under the name A Morning, although due to budget cuts, many of them have been cancelled as of 2009 (though CHRO-TV Ottawa edition of that program, along with a local version of Breakfast Television on A Atlantic, it have since been rebranded under the CTV Morning Live banner since A were bought by Bell Media and all A stations were rebranded as CTV Two in August 2011).
