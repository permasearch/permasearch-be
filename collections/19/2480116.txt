The United States Congress approved construction of a new post office for Washington, D.C., on June 25, 1890.[10] The site, at the southwest corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 12th Street, was chosen by Senator Leland Stanford in 1888[11] in the hope that the building would revitalize the Murder Bay neighborhood between the Capitol building and the White House.[12] The structure was designed in the Romanesque Revival style[13][14] (some classify it as Richardsonian Romanesque)[15] by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department.[13] Construction began in 1892, and the building was complete in 1899.[16][17] The total cost of construction was $3 million.[18]
