The British government's prestige and popularity were enormously boosted by the incident. They had successfully managed to drive a wedge between France and Spain, and demonstrated the power of the Royal Navy â€“ although it was suggested by critics that this gave Lord North a level of complacency and an incorrect belief that the European powers would not interfere in British colonial affairs.

Using his newly found popularity, North took the chance to appoint Lord Sandwich to the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty.
