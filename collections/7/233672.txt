In Hungary, mating takes place in the last week of April, while in the north it happens later in the second week of May. Matings have also been observed in June and even early October, but it is not known if the autumn matings result in any young.[3] Females often breed once every two years,[24] or even once every three years if the seasons are short and the climate is severe.[3]
