Gentamicin, sold under brand names Garamycin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections.[1] This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others.[1] It is not effective for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections.[1] It can be given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, or topically.[1] Topical formulations may be used in burns or for infections of the outside of the eye.[2] In the developed world it is often only used for two days until bacterial cultures determine what antibiotics the infection is sensitive to.[3] The dose required should be monitored by blood testing.[1]
