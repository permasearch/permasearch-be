MacGyver is also passionate about social causes, having on several occasions volunteered to help the less-privileged, showing a particular affinity for and connection with children. For example, he is shown to be a "big brother"[2] and conducts hearing research at a school for deaf children,[3] and helps out in a mountain excursion for delinquent youths.[4] He also strives to protect the environment and endangered species such as eagles,[5] the black rhino,[6] and wolves.[7] It is also established in the episode "Walking Dead"[8] that he became a vegetarian some time during the series run (which had been hinted at before).
