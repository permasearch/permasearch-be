Females lay their eggs singly on the host plant leaves,[20] preferring to oviposit on host plants near nectar sources.[22] The egg is round and green, later turning yellowish green with reddish dots.[20] The size of the egg is large for a butterfly, being 0.8 millimeters (0.03 in) in height and 1.2 millimeters (0.05 in) in width.[23] It takes between 4 and 10 days to hatch.[24]
