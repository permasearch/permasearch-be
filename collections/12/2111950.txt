In support of the words I added, I cited an additional review, by a serious online critic, in the some-critics-had-postive-things-to-say paragraph. I also cited IMDB, something which might be worth discussing. Most genre films - of whatever quality - have their boosters on IMDB, and I wouldn't ordinarily cite these as a ref. In this case, though, the "most useful" reviews of this film on IMDB page accurately reflect opinions widely held by many serious film fans (not just fans of Polanski or of occult-themed films) - to whit, that this film was underrated on its release.
