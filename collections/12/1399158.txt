The Clippers' locker room is smaller than the Lakersâ€™.[65] The arena's seats were originally colored purple, the primary color of the Lakers, as well as the primary colors at the time of construction for the Los Angeles Kings, the National Hockey League (NHL) team that also shares Staples.[68][69][70] However, the seats were replaced with black ones in 2005.[68] The Clippers are the only one of the four Staples tenants without any banners hanging to commemorate championships or retired numbers.[c][71]
