Mumbai Indians had a dismal run in the 2009 edition of the IPL held in South Africa. They were placed at seven in the eight-team points table with just five wins from 14 matches. After the 2009 season, they trimmed their squad by releasing three overseas players in Luke Ronchi, Kyle Mills and Mohammad Ashraful along with several domestic players with an aim of building a new-look team for the 2010 season.
