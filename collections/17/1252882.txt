Furthermore, the layouts of the interior sets would be unfeasible in the exterior sets. For example, the two windows by the fireplace in the Rover's interior set don't exist on the outdoor set; the stairs to the living quarters of the Rovers have changed from right to left to left to right, the toilets would be in Ken Barlow's house and the back room would be in the middle of Rosamund Street.
