The NHL Winter Classic is one of the three series of regular season outdoor games played in the National Hockey League (NHL), and is distinct from the league's other two series, the NHL Heritage Classic and the NHL Stadium Series. The Winter Classic is annually held on or around New Year's Day, generally in a football or baseball stadium, in an area with a resident NHL team. The first Winter Classic was held in 2008 at the venue then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium (now New Era Field) in Orchard Park, New York, between the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins. A total of ten have been held. The most recent game was played during 2017â€“18 season at Citi Field, in Queens, New York on January 1, 2018 between the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres. The Rangers won 3-2 in overtime.
