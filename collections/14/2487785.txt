The Austrian Nazi Party failed to win any seats in the November 1930 general election, but its popularity grew in Austria after Austrian-born Hitler came to power in Germany. The idea of the country joining Germany also grew in popularity, and Anschluss might have occurred by democratic process had Austrian Nazis not begun a terrorism campaign. John Gunther wrote in 1936, "In 1932 Austria was probably eighty percent pro-Anschluss".[27]
