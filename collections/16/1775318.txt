According to the 2009 US Department of State report on Israel and the occupied territories, "The Israeli Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty provides for freedom of worship and the Government generally respected this right in practice."[33] However, Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that places high restrictions on religion,[34] and the U.S. State Department notes that there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.[35] Likewise, the Israeli police enforces a controversial ban against both Jewish and Christian prayer at the Temple Mount where the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque stand. This is a move to prevent any attempts on part of the Muslims or the Waqf (an "Islamic Religious Endowments" organization) to claim offence and start attacking Jews and Christians as a result of the said offence.[35][36][37][38]
