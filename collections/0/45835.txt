After the character was dramatically aged (SORASed), Hope is almost raped by a photographer by the name of Graham Derros. Nick and Aggie Jones save her from being raped. At high school (approaching graduation soon), she met a boy Oliver Jones, a DJ. He is Hope's first serious boyfriend. Instantly, the assertive Steffy takes interest in Oliver and wants to lure him away from Hope. She completes a series of events in order to humiliate Hope. At a fashion show for Forrester, she tampers with a sign taking the letters 'p' and 'e' out of Hope's name to create a sign that reads "Ho Logan". Then, at Hope's graduation party (with a mask theme), her mother has sex with Oliver, thinking it's her husband Ridge; this is revealed by a video which Steffy put together (however, it was later revealed the video was tampered by Justin Barber, who worked for Spencer Publications â€” who are against Forrester Creations). Despite unresolved feelings and never getting a chance with Oliver again, Hope forgives her mother. Meeting Liam Cooper, who was soon revealed to be the son of Bill Spencer, Jr., their relationship grows despite Oliver trying to win back Hope by making her jealous, by being in a relationship with Amber Moore. Their relationship later faces hardship when Amber falls pregnant after supposedly raping Liam, and Liam is thought to be the father during the whole pregnancy. Hope, unable to deal with the idea of Liam being with another woman and having a child, decides she must move on. The baby, when born, is revealed to not be Liam's.
