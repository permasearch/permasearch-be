In 2007, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation announced five finalist design teams that were chosen to submit their ideas for the future park and Great Promenade;[20][21] the GIPEC had awarded leases to its first two tenants a year before.[21] The corporation appointed West 8, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Rogers Marvel Architects, Quennell Rothschild & Partners, and SMWM to design a development plan for Governors Island.[22][23] The plan included 87 acres (35Â ha) of open space on the island, as well as provided for the restoration of the historic district and a new park on the southern half of the island.[20] Each firm was asked their visions for the new park. Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8's proposal featured dramatic topography "in concert with winding pathways and trees to create 'conceal and reveal' vistas, choreographing the park experience."[24] The firm also proposed free bicycle rentals around the island;[20][22][25] and, since the island is windy, designed their proposed topography to provide moments of shelter.[22] With transportation to and from the island, one idea considered was an aerial gondola system designed by Santiago Calatrava.[22][26]
