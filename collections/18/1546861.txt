Amber asks Cedric to cast a magic spell that will give her and James separate birthdays so that she can celebrate the day all by herself. When the spell goes wrong, it accidentally turns James into a baby, and Sofia helps Amber realize how special it is to have a twin, and work together to help Cedric reverse his spell.
