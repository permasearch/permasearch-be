The following morning, Bobbie initiated to talk to Alex about what she saw but they ended up arguing with each other because of it. On the other hand, Teddie went to see Frodo and asked for forgiveness for what happened the other day. When she returned home, she was welcomed by the Bayags who came over to show the gowns that they are going to wear for the wedding. The Salazars did not like the gown designs so Honey Boy (Boboy Garovillo) decided that they play charades - wherein the family who wins gets to decide what gown designs to wear on the wedding day.
