20 years later, the future Dimmsdale is a normal, technologically advanced place. Timmy's children, Tommy and Tammy, are unearthing Timmy's old time capsule. The children take the time capsule to their father Timmy, who is now a working man at the age of 30, dressed in a tie and getting ready for work. His children ask about the time capsule, as Timmy views the photograph he removed from it. As a result of his age, Timmy no longer remembers his fairies and sees only normal goldfish. Timmy pockets the picture and leaves for work, ironically leaving his children under the care of a violent babysitter robot modeled after Vicky. His children beg for him to take them with him, when it's revealed that Cosmo and Wanda are watching over them as goldfish like they did for Timmy 20 years ago, they remark that some things never change.
