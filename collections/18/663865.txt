Thylacines preyed on devils, and devils attacked thylacine young; devils may have hastened the thylacine's extinction.[57] While the thylacine was extant, apart from hunting devils, it may also have put pressure on the devil for survival, by competing for scarce food and dens; both animals sought caves and burrows.[57] It has been speculated that devils may have become more predacious and presided over larger home ranges to fill in the vacancy left by the thylacine.[65]
