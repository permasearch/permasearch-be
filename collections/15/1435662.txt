The enzyme is inhibited by high ratios of ATP:ADP, acetyl-CoA:CoA, and NADH:NAD, as high concentrations of ATP, acetyl-CoA, and NADH show that the energy supply is high for the cell. It is also inhibited by succinyl-CoA, which resembles Acetyl-coA and acts as a uncompetitive inhibitor. Citrate inhibits the reaction and is an example of product inhibition. The inhibition of citrate synthase by acetyl-CoA analogues has also been well documented and has been used to prove the existence of a single active site. These experiments have revealed that this single site alternates between two forms, which participate in ligase and hydrolase activity respectively.[7] This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.
