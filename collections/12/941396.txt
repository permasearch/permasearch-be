Glomus is the only genus in the family Glomeraceae, in the division Glomeromycota. Some members of the genus were originally described as Sclerocystis species, but this genus has been entirely transferred to Glomus. However, further taxonomic changes are likely as the phylogeny of AM fungi becomes better understood.
