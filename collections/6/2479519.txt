While in high school, McVeigh became interested in computers and hacked into government computer systems on his Commodore 64 under the handle "The Wanderer", borrowed from the song by Dion DiMucci. In his senior year, McVeigh was named Starpoint Central High School's "most promising computer programmer,"[12] but he maintained relatively poor grades until his 1986 graduation.[1]
