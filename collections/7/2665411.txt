Will Rogers World Airport recorded an estimated 11.6 inches of snow, smashing the all-time daily snowfall record for the month of February for Oklahoma City (the previous record was 6.5 inches on February 7, 1986).[7] Tulsa also set an all-time snowfall record for the storm for February 1 and the month of February, as the Tulsa International Airport received 14 inches of accumulated snowfall (the previous February snowfall record for the city of Tulsa was 10.5 inches in February 2003, and the previous record for snowfall in a single 24-hour period in Tulsa was 12.9 inches on March 8–9, 1994).[106]Owasso, Oklahoma received the most snowfall accumulation in Oklahoma with 21 inches. Ironically days earlier on January 29, wildfires had burned parts of central and south-central Oklahoma, and ten central and south-central Oklahoma counties were placed under a burn ban due to very dry, wildfire-prone conditions. State Insurance Commissioner John Doak issued an emergency order to allow licensed claims adjustors outside of Oklahoma to help assess damages and losses from the storm for 90 days.[107] On February 2, Governor Fallin asked the White House to approve an emergency disaster declaration request for all 77 Oklahoma counties. In a statement by Fallin, state and local governments would receive 75% reimbursement for expenses associated with responding to the storm if the declaration is approved, including overtime costs, costs associated with operating shelters and clearing snow and ice-covered roads.[108] That evening, President Barack Obama granted Fallin's federal emergency request, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state of Oklahoma.[109]
