The 2018 World Women's Curling Championship (branded as the 2018 Ford World Women's Curling Championship for sponsorship reasons) was held from March 17-25 at the North Bay Memorial Gardens in North Bay, Ontario, Canada.[2] The format of the tournament was changed this year, with 13 teams qualifying for the tournament (as opposed to 12 in previous years), and the top 6 teams from round-robin play will qualify for the playoffs (rather than 4). The playoff system were single-knockout, where the top two teams received a bye while the remaining four played the first round.
