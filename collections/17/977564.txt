After being cast as yachtsman Dennis Conner in the 1986 Australian TV miniseries The Challenge about the 1983 Americaâ€™s Cup challenge, Hammond liked the country so much that he decided to stay. He later became an Australian citizen and has since then appeared in several television miniseries filmed in Australia. This included an important role as an American WW-II officer based in Far North Queensland in the major mini-series Fields of Fire, series I and II, set in the cane-fields of tropical Australia. His character represented the gentler side of the culture-clash between Australians and Americans. He had a starring role as Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne in Mirror, Mirror, an Australia/New Zealand extended miniseries (a complete story of 20 serialised episodes, with cliffhangers between each of the episodes). Hammond also guest-starred in various Australian television series, including satirical television programs such as BackBerner and CNNNN, the science fiction program Farscape, and dramatic series such as The Flying Doctors, MDA and the Australian/USA co-production Mission: Impossible (which was filmed in Australia).
