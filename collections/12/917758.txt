Also on 6 and 7 February, the first of the 60,000 Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medals to be distributed to citizens and permanent residents were handed out by lieutenant governors,[88] commissioners,[83] and other dignitaries across the country; 60 individuals were given theirs personally by the Governor General at Rideau Hall.[82][84][89] All federal Members of Parliament (MPs) received the award automatically and a few refused, some because they belonged to the Quebec separatist Bloc Québécois,[90] and one because he felt the money being spent by the Crown on jubilee events and markers was a waste.[91] Citizens for a Canadian Republic claimed that day that the government's spending of money on the Queen's jubilee was to be expected "from the personality cult dynasties of North Korea or Syria".[92] The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society claimed it would stage "counter-celebrations".[90]
