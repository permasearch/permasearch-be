The Arjunayanas (area of Mathura) and Yaudheyas mention military victories on their coins ("Victory of the Arjunayanas", "Victory of the Yaudheyas"). During the 1st century BC, the Trigartas, Audumbaras[190] and finally the Kunindas[191] also started to mint their own coins, usually in a style highly reminiscent of Indo-Greek coinage.[192][193][194][195]
