Toadsworth (キノじい, Kinojii) is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime steward, first appearing in Super Mario Sunshine, when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game. Paper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her. In Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in Super Princess Peach where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room. He also appeared in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, where he was inhaled by Bowser. In Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.
