Degrassi: The Next Generation is also available in various new media formats. Episodes are streamed on the websites of MuchMusic and TeenNick to viewers with Canadian or US IP addresses.[102][103] Registered users of the Canadian and American iTunes Stores can purchase episodes for playback on home computers and certain iPods.[104] In Canada, Puretracks also offers episodes for download. They are issued as a Windows Media 10 file, and the purchaser owns them forever, although the episodes can only be burned onto a disc three times and copied to a device three times.[105] In the US, Zune and the Xbox Live Marketplace sell every episode of the series.[106]
