In the beginning of season 2, Frederick comes through the portal after Ingrid opened it, and shows up on his family's doorstep, though his motives are still questionable. He takes note that Joanna is poisoned by Argentium and cures her. His mother and sisters are excited to have him back in the family, but Wendy remains distrustful and suspicious of his actions. Her suspicions are encouraged by the mysterious murders occurring around town. He eventually gains her trust when he saves her from the Mandragora, but later loses it again, along with the rest of his family's, when they find out he had been working with Nikolaus, whom he was led to believe to have changed for the better. At the end of the series, he sides with his family against Nikolaus and helps Ingrid create a time portal to save Joanna, Wendy and Freya. He was eventually murdered by a mysterious woman, with his blood drawing "Death to Witches" on the floor.
