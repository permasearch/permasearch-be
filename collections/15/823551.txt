Over the past 65 years, over 13,000 students from more than 160 countries have studied at ISS. Many now hold leading positions in government, international organisations, higher education, planning agencies and non-governmental organisations.[20] These former students create the international ISS alumni community. A community in which ideas, experiences and views are shared, often for a long time after graduating. Two alumni groups can be found on Facebook and LinkedIn: ISS Alumni and Connecting the world. Alumni relations are coordinated by the office ISS Alumni Relations in The Hague.
