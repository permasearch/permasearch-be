Jackson was initially critical of the "Third Way" or more moderate policies of Bill Clinton, so much so that, according to journalist Peter Beinart, Clinton was "petrified about a primary challenge from" Jackson in the 1996 election.[59] However, he became a key ally in gaining African American support for Clinton and eventually became a close adviser and friend of the Clinton family.[58] His son, Jesse Jackson Jr., also emerged as a political figure, becoming a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois.
