The term virgin originally only referred to sexually inexperienced women, but has evolved to encompass a range of definitions, as found in traditional, modern, and ethical concepts.[3][5][6][7] Heterosexual individuals may or may not consider loss of virginity to occur only through penile-vaginal penetration,[3][6][8][9] while people of other sexual orientations often include oral sex, anal sex or mutual masturbation in their definitions of losing one's virginity.[3][7][10] The social implications of virginity still remain in many societies, and can have varying effects on an individual's social agency based upon location.
