There is one airport, Norfolk Island Airport.[5] There are 80 kilometres (50 mi) of roads on the island (53 km (33 mi) paved, 27 km (17 mi) unpaved); however, local law gives cows the right of way.[58] Speed limits are low: 50 km/h (31 mph) maximum in the territory, 40 km/h (25 mph) in town and 30 km/h (19 mph) near schools.[123] There was formerly an airline, Norfolk Island Airlines, which connected Norfolk Island with Brisbane.
