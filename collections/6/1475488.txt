Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart)[111] but is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall.[112] Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April,[90] owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the breeze is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.[90]
