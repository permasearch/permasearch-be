In P2P networks, clients both provide and use resources. This means that unlike client-server systems, the content-serving capacity of peer-to-peer networks can actually increase as more users begin to access the content (especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share, refer a performance measurement study[39]). This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor.[40][41]
