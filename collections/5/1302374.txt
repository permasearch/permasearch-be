After the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988, the nameplate was revived in 1995 for the fifth-generation, a front-drive, V6-powered coupe based on the Chevrolet Lumina sedan. The sixth and final-generation Monte Carlo in 2000 was built alongside the Chevrolet Impala, which succeeded the Lumina as Chevy's mid-sized sedan. The Monte Carlo SS was revived from 2000 to 2007, that was initially powered by 3.8 L V6 (supercharged in 2004 and 2005) and by a 5.3 L V8 for 2006 and 2007.
