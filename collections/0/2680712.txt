The 416 area code has been split twice. The western portion of 416 (including Kitchener) was combined with the southern portion of 613 to form area code 519 in 1953, leaving 416 largely coextensive with the area generally reckoned as the core of the Golden Horseshoe. Despite the Greater Toronto Area's rapid growth, this configuration remained for 40 years.
