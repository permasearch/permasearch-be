Robert Fogel (1926â€“2013), a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in 1993, is well known for his historical analysis and his introduction of New economic history,[14] and invention of cliometrics, a notation system for quantitative data.[15] In his tract, Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History, Fogel set out to rebut comprehensively the idea that railroads contributed to economic growth in the 19th century. Later, in Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery, he argued that slaves in the Southern states of America had a higher standard of living than the industrial proletariat of the Northern states before the American civil war.
