Emerson was, in part, reflecting on his personal vocational crisis after leaving his role as a minister.[1] Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. declared this speech to be America's "Intellectual Declaration of Independence."[2] Building on the growing attention he was receiving from the essay Nature, this speech solidified Emerson's popularity and weight in America, a level of reverence he would hold throughout the rest of his life. Phi Beta Kappa's literary quarterly magazine, The American Scholar, was named after the speech and, when printed, sold well.[3]
