Cudgegong Road and Cherrybrook stations are being built as stations in a cutting, open to the sky, but below ground level while Castle Hill, Showground and Norwest stations will be underground, whereas Kellyville and Rouse Hill will be above ground. The twin tunnels between Epping and Kellyville, at 15.5 km (9.6 mi) long,[20] will be the longest rail tunnels in Sydney when they are built.[26] They will also be the deepest tunnels in Sydney: 67 m (220 ft) below ground at the deepest point below the intersection of Pennant Hills Road and Castle Hill Road—deeper than the floor of Sydney Harbour (about 50 m (160 ft)), and much deeper than the deepest point of the City Circle tunnels at St James (about 11 m (36 ft)).[78] Most of the tunnel will be bored, although the section at Kellyville will be constructed using cut-and-cover techniques.[78][79] Major tunnelling began in 2014.[80]
