Meanwhile, Alice finds a picture in the newspaper of George and Angela boating with friends, and realizes that George lied to her about his intentions for wanting to go to the lake. During a dinner which is attended by the Eastman and Vickers families, George appears to be on the verge of finally advancing into the business and social realm that he has long sought. However, Alice phones the house during the dinner party, and asks to speak with George; she tells him that she is at the bus station, and that if he doesn't come to get her, she'll come to where he is and expose him. Visibly shaken, he announces to the families that his mother is ill, and that he must suddenly leave, but promises Angela that he will return. The next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married, but they find it closed for Labor Day. Relieved, George then suggests spending the day at the nearby lake; Alice unsuspectingly agrees.
