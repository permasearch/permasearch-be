The artist Jules Guérin was commissioned to create six murals for Penn Station; each of his works were over 100 feet (30 m) tall.[81]  The station contained four pairs of sculptures designed by A.A. Weinman, titled "Day" and "Night". These sculpture pairs flanked large clocks on the top of each side of the building.[65][3]:76 The "Day" and "Night" sculptures were accompanied by small stone eagles.[82] There were also 22 larger, freestanding stone eagles placed on Penn Station's exterior.[83]
