The Sly Park Unit includes Sly Park Dam, Jenkinson Lake, the Camp Creek Diversion Dam, and two diversion tunnels. The Sly Park Dam and its similarilly-sized auxiliary dam form Jenkinson Lake, which covers 650 acres (260 ha).[22] Jenkinson Lake feeds the Camino Conduit, a 5 mi (8.0 km) aqueduct.[17] The Camp Creek Diversion Dam diverts some water from Camp Creek into Jenkinson Lake.[23]
