On 15 July, Lafayette was acclaimed commander-in-chief of the National Guard of France, an armed force established to maintain order, and under the control of the Assembly.[101][102] Lafayette proposed the name and the symbol of the group: a blue, white and red cockade.  This combined the red and blue colors of the city of Paris with the royal white, and originated the French tricolor.[98][100] He faced a difficult task as head of the Guardâ€”the king and many loyalists considered Lafayette and those who agreed with him little better than revolutionaries, whereas many commoners felt he was helping the king keep power. On 26 August, the National Assembly approved the Declaration.[103]
