Recognition tests do not require participants to produce a word from memory.  Instead participants are literally shown a word, and are asked to report whether it was a word that appeared during the study phase.  Recognition tests typically show all of the studied words and a number of non-studied words, the lures. Researchers measure how often participants correctly recognize studied items, and how often they incorrectly recognize lures.  The difference between these two proportions is a statistic measuring one's ability to discriminate between studied and non-studied items, and has been used to represent RIF.[17][18] Reaction time is also used to represent RIF, where slower reaction times are thought to represent more RIF due to difficulty in recognizing the studied item.[17][19]
