In response to the 5th JNA Corps advance across the Sava River towards Pakrac and further north into western Slavonia,[179] the Croatian army began a successful counterattack in early November 1991, its first major offensive operation of the war. Operation Otkos 10 (31 October to 4 November) resulted in Croatia recapturing an area between the Bilogora and Papuk mountains.[180][181] The Croatian Army recaptured approximately 270 square kilometers (100 sq mi) of territory in this operation.[181]
