Zits enters another volatile situation with Gus, a nineteenth-century Indian tracker. In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the westward expansion of pioneers created a powder keg in the form of crowded Native American tribes and nervous white settlers.

After Sand Creek, military- sanctioned retaliatory massacres declined and eventually stopped.
