One of the posters for the film showed a cat in a tumble dryer, with the implication being that Junior had put it inside.[13]  A group named In Defence Of Animals organised protests against the posters, and some cinemas took them down in response.[13] The group also objected to a scene in the film in which Junior splinters a cat's legs.[13]
