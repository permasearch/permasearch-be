In April 2013, Stavros was revealed to be alive, after Helena had saved him from the bottom of the pit twelve years earlier. With Stavros on the brink of death, Helena whisked him away to Cassadine Island in Greece, where he had been recovering ever since. Stavros is eventually discovered to be alive by Nikolas sometime in December 2012, and in an effort to discover what his father and grandmother are up to, attempts to endear himself to them. On April 12, Luke and Laura rescue Lulu from Stavros and trap him in his own cryogenic chamber. He is presumed dead.
