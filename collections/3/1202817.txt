The Titans made their first American Football League Draft selection in 1961. They chose Tom Brown, a defensive lineman/guard from the University of Minnesota, known as the "Rock of Gibraltar", who won the 1960 Outland Trophy as the nation's best lineman and finished 2nd in the Heisman Trophy voting.[1] Brown later became a College Football Hall of Famer and Canadian Football Hall of Famer.
