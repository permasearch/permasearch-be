The term two's complement can mean either a number format or a mathematical operator. For example, 0111 represents decimal 7 in two's-complement notation, but the two's complement of 7 in a 4-bit register is actually the "1001" bit string (the same as represents 9 = 24 − 7 in unsigned arithmetics) which is the two's complement representation of −7. The statement "convert x to two's complement" may be ambiguous, since it could describe either the process of representing x in two's-complement notation without changing its value, or the calculation of the two's complement, which is the arithmetic negative of x if two's complement representation is used.
