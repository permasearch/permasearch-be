The trio began work on their third major release, How Does Your Garden Grow?, soon after the end of touring for Friction, Baby. The album was recorded between mid-January and late-April at a studio in New Orleans.[10] The album was produced by record producer Malcolm Burn, who had formerly produced Iggy Pop and U2,[11] and released on August 25, 1998.[10] The album was described as "experimental" and a significant departure from their previous two albums.[7] Griffin described the album in 1998 as "guitar driven ... rhythmic."[10] Likewise, Tom Drummond described the band's thinking on its third major album, "We thought the third album was a very important record, because generally a band either makes or breaks on the third record. We wanted it to be a record that didn't necessarily sound like what people expected." [7] Despite the emphasis on guitar experimentation, two tracks, "One More Murder" and "Je ne m'en souviens pas" contain no guitars.[10]
