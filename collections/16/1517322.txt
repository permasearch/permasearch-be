Sport is an important part of Australian culture dating back to the early colonial period. Cricket, Australian rules football, rugby union and horse racing are among the earliest organized sports in Australia. Sport has shaped the Australian national identity through events such as the Ashes, the Melbourne Cup and the America's Cup.
