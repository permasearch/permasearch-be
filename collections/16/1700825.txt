Only 5 percent of the Memorial's collection is displayed at any time, with the remainder being stored at the Treloar Resource Centre in the industrial suburb of Mitchell.[10] The facility also includes workshops that are used for restoration tasks. The Treloar Resource Centre is occasionally opened to the public for "Big Things in Store" open days.[11]
