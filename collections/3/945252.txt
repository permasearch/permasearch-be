Union starred in the 2007 film Daddy's Little Girls by Tyler Perry (released on Valentine's Day). She played Julia Rossmore, a romantically challenged attorney. The role was written with her in mind.[22] Before working with Perry, she went to see his stage show to both understand him and his audience.[23] She filmed Daddy's Little Girls over the summer of 2006 in Atlanta, Georgia.[24] Union was seen as performing her character well along with Idris Elba and having a "great sense of comedic timing".[25] Union's character also drew comparisons to Eva, her role in Deliver Us from Eva. According to Union, Perry had specifically approached her over not turning the role into the same character.[26] Union made an appearance in the 2007 Christmas film The Perfect Holiday, which opened on December 12. Since she had no children of her own, Union used her mother and sister to portray the divorced single mother of three in the film.[27] Union initially turned down the role, as she did not want to get typecast for playing a mother until she was told of other actresses that had played similar roles and still found success in their careers.[6]
