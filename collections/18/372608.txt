The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was designed during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402â€“1424), shortly before its construction in the early 15th century. It was first discovered by the Western world when European travelers like Johan Nieuhof visited it,[5] sometimes listing it as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. After this exposure to the outside world, the tower was seen as a national treasure to both locals and other cultures around the world.
