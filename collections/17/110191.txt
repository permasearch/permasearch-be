The economy of North India is predominantly agrarian, but is changing fast with rapid economic growth that has ranged above 8% annually. Several parts of North India have prospered as a consequence of the Green Revolution, including Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, and have experienced both economic and social development.[69][70][71] The eastern areas of East Uttar Pradesh, however, have lagged[72][73] and the resulting disparity has contributed to a demand for separate statehood in West Uttar Pradesh (the Harit Pradesh movement).[74][75] Bihar's economy has been the fastest growing state economy in India, higher than all the Indian states including Gujarat.
