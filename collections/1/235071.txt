DID is controversial both within psychiatry and the legal system.[6][3] In court cases it has been used as a rarely successful form of the insanity defense.[8][9] It is unclear if increased rates of the disorder are due to better recognized or sociocultural factors such as media portrayals.[3] A large proportion of diagnoses is clustered around a small number of clinicians which supports the hypothesis that DID may be therapist-induced.[3] The typical presenting symptoms in different regions of the world may also vary depending on how the disorder is depicted by the media.[3]
