The band, founded by guitarist Kellen McGregor, formed in 2006,[2] but it was not until February 2007 that the group decided on the name Memphis May Fire having previously gone by Oh Captain, My Captain.[3] In early 2007, the band recorded and self-released an EP, and began creating a local following.[4] Shortly thereafter, Memphis May Fire caught the attention of Josh Grabelle, the president of Trustkill Records. Grabelle commented on his feelings toward the band in a press release stating, "There is a lot of really exciting, young, dangerous music coming out right now, and Memphis May Fire are the cream of the crop. Not since Bullet for My Valentine's Hand of Blood have we heard a more compelling set of songs for an EP, where absolutely every song is bone-chillingly perfect, and timeless. These guys are on their way to something huge."[5][6] In September 2007 the band had officially signed to Trustkill, and their self-titled EP was reissued through the label in December 2007.[3] In 2007, through 2008, the band embarked on Twelve Gauge Valentine's final-tour along with The Handshake Murders.[7]
