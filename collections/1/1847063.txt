This, however, meant there would be more riders packed into smaller trains, and led some passengers to miss trains because they were standing at the wrong part of the platform.[40] In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the "4" and "6" markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars.[19][41] Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms.[42] In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).[41][43][44][45]
