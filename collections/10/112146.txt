In situ investigations have been performed on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, has suggested that the Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form.[181] Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.[182] The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.[183] A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm ClO− 4, 1.4 ppm ClO− 3, and 16 ppm NO− 3, most likely of Martian origin. The ClO− 3 suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines, such as ClO− 2 or ClO, produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of ClO− 4. Thus, only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics or life forms are likely to survive.[184]
