Alice Jane Witney is a character in the novel Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs. The daughter of George Arthur Witney, the owner of a traveling carnival called Doktor Geistmann's Carnival of Terror, Alice loathes her life, believing the carnival has ruined any chance she has for a better life. After the carnival is run out of Crystal Lake by the superstitious locals, Alice, while driving an RV drunk, runs over Jason Voorhees. Jason, weakened due to his battle with Freddy Krueger, is knocked out after being hit and is collected by Alice and the other carnival workers, who decide to use him as the newest sideshow attraction. While setting up the Jason display in a town, Alice learns from fellow carnival worker Kenton Freely that her mother had hated the carnival and that her father had lied to her - Alice's mother did not die in a carnival accident, she had actually died when George stabbed her to death after finding her and Kenton together; Kenton had been blackmailing George with this information, so he could embezzle from the carnival and eventually take it over. Devastated by this news, Alice, becoming drunk, steals a laptop from one of the carnies and uses it to put Jason up for sale on an internet auction site called ZingBid. Passing out after putting Jason up for auction, Alice awakens to find Jason rampaging through the carnival, having woken after a teenage girl named Glo, who had been possessed by Pamela Voorhees, came in proximity to him. After he kills the Pamela-possessed Glo, Jason falls comatose again and is taken by Alice, who drives away from the ruined carnival. Despite losing her laptop and being attacked by FBI agents and Jason when he briefly revives, Alice manages to reach a computer and successfully sells Jason to a shock rocker named Ross Feratu for five million dollars. Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs ends with Alice relaxing in a resort in the Caribbean, enjoying her new wealth.[1]
