Although main group elements of the second period and beyond usually react by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have achieved a valence shell electron configuration with a full octet of (8) electrons, other elements obey different rules. Hydrogen (H) can only form bonds which share just two electrons, while transition metals often conform to a duodectet (12)[5] rule (e.g., compounds such as the permanganate ion).
