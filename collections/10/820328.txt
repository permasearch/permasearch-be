The maximum length of stay that Medicare Part A covers in a hospital inpatient stay or series of stays is typically 90 days. The first 60 days would be paid by Medicare in full, except one copay (also and more commonly referred to as a "deductible") at the beginning of the 60 days of $1,288 as of 2016. Days 61–90 require a co-payment of $322 per day as of 2016. The beneficiary is also allocated "lifetime reserve days" that can be used after 90 days. These lifetime reserve days require a copayment of $644 per day as of 2016, and the beneficiary can only use a total of 60 of these days throughout their lifetime.[25] A new pool of 90 hospital days, with new copays of $1288 in 2016 and $302 per day for days 61–90, starts only after the beneficiary has 60 days continuously with no payment from Medicare for hospital or nursing home confinement.[26]
