With Nadal widely regarded as invincible on clay courts by many in the tennis world,[43][44] Djokovic emerged as one of the few who could test his dominance on it, and the closest Nadal came to losing for the first time in this tournament came in May 2009. It was the longest Masters match and semi final in Open Era history. Djokovic ranked No. 4 in the world, took the first set 6â€“3. But the world No. 1 Nadal remained resilient, saving three match points and eventually ending up winning in three sets after four hours and two minutes[45] in what he called one of his greatest wins in his career.
