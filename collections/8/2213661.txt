The Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects RÃ¶merberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the Wehrmacht, it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.
