Lyrically, "Love Yourself" is a kiss-off to a narcissistic ex-lover who did the protagonist wrong,[15][9] with Bieber singing in a snappy and spiteful tone[16] while "hating on a girl for loving herself too much."[17] In the pre-chorus, he sings with a husky tone in the lower registers:[16] "My mama don't like you, and she likes everyone," "in a style that molds well to Sheeran's," according to Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos.[1] "And I [never] like to admit that I was wrong. And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on, and now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own," he continues.[1] In the chorus, Bieber sings, "Cause if you like the way you look that much, oh baby you should go and love yourself,"[17] which according to Digital Spy's Amy Davidson, "'love yourself' means 'go f**k yourself' in this context."[18] On March 7, 2017, composer Ed Sheeran stated on the Howard Stern Show that he had Rihanna in mind for the song at first, and the original lyric was indeed "fuck yourself." [19] In the song's bridge, Bieber uses a "brass-and-vocalese" style.[20]
