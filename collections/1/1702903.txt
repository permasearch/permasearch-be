Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA’s and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.[282] The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.[283] Many developed countries are implementing ‘first generation’ institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.[282] There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.[284]
