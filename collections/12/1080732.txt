In this game[10] between Yuri Averbakh and Cecil Purdy, Black castled queenside. Averbakh pointed out that the rook passed over a square controlled by White and thought it was illegal. Purdy proved that the castling was legal since this applies only to the king, to which Averbakh replied "Only the king? Not the rook?" (Evans 1970:38â€“39), (Lombardy & Daniels 1975:188).
