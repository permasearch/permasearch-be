The popularity and catchy nature of the song has seen it used in numerous commercials and television series. The song was heard in TV spots for the American comedy series Ugly Betty. In the United Kingdom the song was featured in series 2 of the BBC television series Gavin & Stacey. An alternative version of the song is played in the British film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, in a scene where the main character Georgia is dressed as a stuffed olive. It has also been used in LACVERT's commercial for their lipstick, Ice Kiss, featuring the Olympic gold medalist Kim Yuna. The Stubborn skit in Gag Concert uses the song too.
