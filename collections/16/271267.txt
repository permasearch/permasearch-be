With an average annual precipitation of 3,668 mm (144.4 in), Lago Frías in Río Negro Province is considered to be the wettest place in Argentina.[139] Although an average annual precipitation of 6,251 mm (246.1 in) has been recorded in Lago Tromen in Neuquén Province, the validity of the data is dubious owing to fewer years of data.[139] Lago Frías also has the record for wettest monthly precipitation in Argentina: 1,147 mm (45.2 in) of precipitation was recorded in May 1951.[135] In contrast, the driest place is Angualasto, San Juan Province, which only receives 24 mm (0.94 in) of precipitation a year.[139] The highest recorded one-day rainfall total occurred on April 2, 2013, when 392.2 mm (15.44 in) of rain fell in La Plata at the La Plata Astronomical Observatory,[140] causing massive flooding and power outages.[141]
