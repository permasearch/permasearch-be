Around this time he had become well known as an entertaining talk show guest, starting with an appearance on The Merv Griffin Show. He made jokes at his own expense, calling himself America's most "well-known unknown" who only made the kind of movies "they show in airplanes or prisons or anywhere else the people can't get out." He proved enormously popular and was frequently asked back by Griffin, then Johnny Carson; he even guest hosted.[16] He was so popular as a guest he was offered his own talk show but he wanted to keep on as an actor.[37]
