The band was founded by Clement Marfo. Marfo, who was educated at Wimbledon College and served as Deputy Head Boy there,[2] started his career as a hip-hop artist, but soon wanted to have a live band to work with and to dabble in the rock scene. Dion, whom Clement met through a mutual friend, introduced Marfo to Richard Sinclair, Daniel Turnbull, Stacey Mansell, and Jonny Douch. Previously, Marfo had found vocalist Kojo Vihram on Myspace and wanted to work with him too, leading to the formation of The Frontline. Although he has been shown to rap, Dion became the band's drummer.[3]
