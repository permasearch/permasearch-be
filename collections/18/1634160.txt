One study by Cynthia Dunn observed a Japanese business that required etiquette training for their new employers.[23] Employers were taught the company's definition of politeness; they were expected to incorporate these beliefs into their day-to-day behavior, such as "kindness," "consideration for others," and "deference and respect".[23] However, self-presentation was also a critical feature employers wanted their employees to improve upon. An attractive self-presentation through various nonverbals and word choice would not only reflect the individual's politeness but the corporation's as well.[23] This decision had very positive consequences in the workplace environment.
