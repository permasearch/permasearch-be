What separated this from the televised series was the fact that the live feed from the house saw significantly less blockage. For example, the live feed showed the house guests moving in and meeting one another, something that's never been shown live or unedited. Also, while more simplistic than on the televised version, viewers got to see competitions from start to finish, which are almost always never shown on the live feed.
