Paul Becker, who was bought on board as the choreographer for the episode, confirmed the news on his instagram account on February 9, 2017.[2] However, during the final day of shooting, Colin O'Donoghue injured his foot while performing his number.[3] Most of the cast did the recording first, with the choreography done afterwards, so the playback can blend in with the scenes.
