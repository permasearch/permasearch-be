On July 21, both the JMA and the JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 08W had developed approximately 582 km (361 mi) to the south of Hong Kong.[48][49] After moving westward for a couple of days, the system strengthened into a tropical storm by both agencies while nearing the island province of Hainan, receiving the name Sonca.[50][48] By July 24, Sonca reached its maximum intensity with a minimum pressure of 994 hPa.[48] Early on July 25, the JTWC issued its final advisory as the system made landfall over in Quảng Trị Province, Vietnam.[51][52] The JMA issued its final advisory a few hours later when it had weakened into a tropical depression,[48] although Sonca maintained its intensity over land until it had fully dissipated on July 29.[48]
