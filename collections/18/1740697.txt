The mid-size luxury segment is commonly referred to as executive cars in Britain, Obere Mittelklasse in German, and Grandes RoutiÃ¨res in French.[14][15][44] Examples of models in this category include Acura TLX, Audi A6, Audi A7, Volvo S90, Genesis G80, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF, Maserati Ghibli, Cadillac CTS, Lincoln MKZ, Lexus GS, and Infiniti Q70.[45][46][47][48] Although Maserati vehicles have traditionally been priced as ultra-luxury cars, the new Maserati Ghibli III is intended to compete with high-spec executive cars, such as the Audi S6/S7, BMW 550i and Mercedes-Benz E550/CLS550.[1][2]
