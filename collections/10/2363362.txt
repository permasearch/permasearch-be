For Bennion, it was "a credit to the two creators that they can pack in such a depth of emotion into 29 minutes".[10] Similarly, Wilson praised the writers for achieving "genuine poignancy" in half an hour,[13] and critics in the Metro said that the episode "packs more drama and suspense into 30 minutes than many a five-part series".[19] Mulkern said the episode was a "superb piece of drama, imbued with an increasing sense of dread".[20] The story's ending was praised, with Dessau saying that "One of the skills of actor/writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton is the way they plant seeds and gradually leak out details. They do it so expertly here that one really doesn't see what is coming."[14] McDowall expressed a similar thought, saying that the "writers so cleverly threw us off the scent, making the eventual realisation so agonising".[11] Wilson called the ending "devastating and unforeseen".[13]
