The second test was notable for the sending off of Sonny Bill Williams, leaving the All Blacks 65 minutes to play with 14 men. At half time, the score remained 9–9, but Beauden Barrett kicked New Zealand into an 18–9 lead before Taulupe Faletau and Conor Murray tries levelled the game at 21–21. On 76 minutes, Charlie Faumuina was penalised for tackling Kyle Sinckler in the air, and Owen Farrell kicked the winning penalty.[63]
