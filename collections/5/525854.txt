Seahawks' LB Malcolm Smith was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player.[1][122] Denver fell to 2–5 in Super Bowls, while five-time league MVP Manning dropped to 11–12 in the playoffs, and 1–2 in the Super Bowl.[122] Including Denver's loss, none of the eight highest-scoring teams in league history won a Super Bowl in the same season, and all four teams who entered the championship with the league's leading passer lost the game.[16] Manning's 34 completions and Demaryius Thomas' 13 receptions were both Super Bowl records.[128][129]
