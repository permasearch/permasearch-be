Following tests of a new instant messaging platform on Facebook in March 2008,[7][8] the feature, then-titled "Facebook Chat", was gradually released to users in April 2008.[9][10] Facebook revamped its messaging platform in November 2010,[11] and subsequently acquired group messaging service Beluga in March 2011,[12] which the company used to launch its standalone iOS and Android mobile apps on August 9, 2011.[13][14] Facebook later launched a BlackBerry version in October 2011.[15][16] An app for Windows Phone, though lacking features including voice messaging and chat heads, was released in March 2014.[17][18] In April 2014, Facebook announced that the messaging feature would be removed from the main Facebook app and users will be required to download the separate Messenger app.[19][20] An iPad-optimized version of the iOS app was released in July 2014.[21][22] In April 2015, Facebook launched a website interface for Messenger.[23][24] A Tizen app was released on July 13, 2015.[25] In October 2016, Facebook released Facebook Messenger Lite, a stripped-down version of Messenger with a reduced feature set. The app is aimed primarily at old Android phones and regions where high-speed Internet is not widely available. Facebook Messenger Lite is only available in Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela, and is set to come to other countries later.[26][27] In April 2017, Facebook Messenger Lite was expanded to 132 more countries.[28][29] In May 2017, Facebook revamped the design for Messenger on Android and iOS, bringing a new home screen with tabs and categorization of content and interactive media, red dots indicating new activity, and relocated sections.[30][31]
