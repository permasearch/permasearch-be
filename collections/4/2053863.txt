Buddhism is one of the largest religions in the United States behind Christianity, Judaism and Islam. American Buddhists include many Asian Americans, as well as a large number of converts of other ethnicities, and now their children and even grandchildren.[1][2] In 2012, U-T San Diego estimated U.S. practitioners at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.[3] In terms of percentage, Hawaii has the most Buddhists at 8% of the population due to its large Asian American community.[4]
