The first ARKET store was opened in Regent Street in August 2017, having been in preparations since June 2015.[45][46] The brand is labeled "a modern-day market"[47] and houses a line known as the "archive", in which each item is known by a nine-digit code organised into department, category, product, and material.[48] ARKET also sells children's clothing and homewares, and has an in-store cafÃ©.[48]
