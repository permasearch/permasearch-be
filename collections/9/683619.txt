During the Reagan Administration, Congress passed the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) in 1981 to reduce federal regulations of Title I.[13] This reflected the administrationâ€™s stance that resource control should be in the hands of states and local jurisdictions rather than at a federal level.[13] Despite the change outlined by the ECIA and the new designation of Title I as Chapter I, little was done to implement it and traditional Title I practices, like the use of pull-outs, continued.[12]
