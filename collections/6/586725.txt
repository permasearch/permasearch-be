In 1945, Rotary International had clubs in 65 countries and was working to further international understanding, good will, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service. The purposes of the UN—to maintain an international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations; to help solve international economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian problems; and to promote human rights—parallel those of Rotary.
