The Oracle Database offers a wide range of options[15] and features in the areas of Availability, Scalability, Analytics, Performance, Security, Management, Developers and Integration. These aim to enhance and complement existing database functionality to meet customer-specific requirements.[16] All Database Options are only available for Enterprise Edition and offered for an extra cost.[15][17] An exception to these two rules is Oracle Real Application Clusters option, which comes included with Oracle Database 12c Standard Edition 2 at no additional cost.[18]
