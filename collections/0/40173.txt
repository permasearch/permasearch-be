Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest stable element, approximately twice the density of lead[5] and slightly denser than iridium.[6] Calculations of density from the X-ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements, giving a value of 7004225620000000000♠22.562±0.009 g/cm3 for iridium versus 7004225870000000000♠22.587±0.009 g/cm3 for osmium.[7]
