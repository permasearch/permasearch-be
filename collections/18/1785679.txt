Spitta also saw a rhythmic figure that appears briefly in the concluding part of the work (bar 137) reappear extensively elaborated in the keyboard Prelude in A minor, BWV 922, which he supposes to have been composed around 1710.[31][84] In Reginald Lane Poole's 1882 biography the work is again merely listed.[85] In the 1905 first version of his Bach biography Albert Schweitzer leaves BWV 565 unmentioned in the chapter on the organ works.[86] In Andr√© Pirro's 1906 biography Bach's organ toccatas are only mentioned as a group. He considers none of them written before Bach's later Weimar years (so closer to 1717 than to 1708).[87]
