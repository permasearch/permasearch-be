In 1926, author Zane Grey bought a miner's cabin at Winkle Bar, near the river.[78] He wrote Western books at this location,[78] including his 1929 novel Rogue River Feud.[79] Another of his books, Tales of Fresh Water Fishing (1928), included a chapter based on a drift-boat trip he took down the lower Rogue in 1925. The Trust for Public Land bought the property at Winkle Bar and transferred it in 2008 to the BLM, which made it accessible to the public.[80]
