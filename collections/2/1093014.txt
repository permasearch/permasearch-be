In April 1992, Freddie Garcia, then ABS-CBN executive vice president and general manager, and Johnny Manahan, then program director, formed the idea of creating a stable of new stars exclusively for the network.[2] This gave birth to Talent Center. In its early years, the Talent Center's project was Ang TV.
