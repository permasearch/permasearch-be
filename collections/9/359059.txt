In the first-season episode "'X' Marks the Spot", the radio warns that the Air Force will test launch an armed missile to strike a location near 140° latitude, 10° longitude (note: this is an impossible location—latitude goes only up to 90°, which is at the poles) The Skipper calculates this as their island's location, based on their starting point when the storm hit before they "... drifted for that three days ... with the prevailing western current ...", meaning the deadly missile will hit the island.[2]
