The Dictatus papae have been attributed to Pope Gregory VII (1073â€“1085) in the year 1075, but some have argued that they are later than 1087.[41] They assert that no one can judge the pope (Proposition 19) and that "the Roman church has never erred; nor will it err to all eternity, the Scripture bearing witness" (Proposition 22). This is seen as a further step in advancing the idea that "...had been part of church history and debate as far back as 519 when the notion of the Bishop of Rome as the preserver of apostolic truth was set forth in the Formula of Hormisdas."[42]
