In 1844, the Oregon territories voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages.  This was repealed in 1845, but prohibition was reinstated in a 1915, four years before the national alcohol prohibition.  When national prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was created. Unlike states that allow liquor sales in grocery stores, liquor in Oregon is sold only in OLCC run liquor stores and establishments that have liquor licenses, and the OLCC has strict guidelines and training to ensure that all licensed venues understand how to safely sell and serve alcoholic beverages.[1]  Alcohol and alcoholism are also studied by the state at the Portland Alcohol Research Center.
