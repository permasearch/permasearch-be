O'Bannon had originally assumed that he would direct Alien, but 20th Century Fox instead asked Hill to direct.[40][42] Hill declined due to other film commitments, as well as not being comfortable with the level of visual effects that would be required.[43] Peter Yates, Jack Clayton, and Robert Aldrich were considered for the task, but O'Bannon, Shusett, and the Brandywine team felt that these directors would not take the film seriously and would instead treat it as a B monster movie.[42][44] Giler, Hill, and Carroll had been impressed by Ridley Scott's debut feature film The Duellists (1977) and made an offer to him to direct Alien, which Scott quickly accepted.[28][44] Scott created detailed storyboards for the film in London, which impressed 20th Century Fox enough to double the film's budget.[18][42] His storyboards included designs for the spaceship and space suits, drawing on such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars.[18] However, he was keen on emphasizing horror in Alien rather than fantasy, describing the film as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre of science fiction".[42][44]
