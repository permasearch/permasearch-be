319 variations of cave mineral deposits have been identified.[4] The vast majority of speleothems are calcareous, composed of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite, or calcium sulfate in the form of gypsum. Calcareous speleothems form via carbonate dissolution reactions.[5][6][7] Rainwater in the soil zone reacts with soil CO2 to create weakly acidic water via the reaction:
