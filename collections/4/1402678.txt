Paramount Home Entertainment and (from 2006 onward) CBS Home Entertainment have released all 11 seasons of Cheers on DVD in Region 1, Region 2 and Region 4. In the US, the last three seasons had music substitutions.  In "Grease", "I Fought the Law" was replaced; its removal affected the comedic value of the scenes it was originally in.
