Roughly halfway through the 2017 model year, Hyundai released a Sport model for the North American market. The Sport slots between the Eco and Limited models and is differentiated externally by different headlights and taillights, ground effects, a more aggressive front and rear bumper and dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets. Under the hood, the Sport features a Turbocharged 1.6-liter direct-injected four cylinder producing 201 hp (150 kW) and 195 lb⋅ft (264 N⋅m) of torque. Transmission options include a 7-speed dual clutch automatic with manual shift mode or a traditional 6-speed manual. Additional modifications for the sport include a flat-bottomed steering wheel, red stitching on the seats, shift boot and steering wheel, larger front brakes, 18" alloy wheels, an independent multi-link rear suspension, a thicker front stabilizer bar and a steering ratio tuned for a quicker, sportier feel.
