On a girls night with Haley, she assures Brooke that Julian loves her and he's not going anywhere. Brooke has a pregnancy scare and wants to tell Julian but he left to see Alex as he fears she will begin using drugs again, and she doesn't get the chance to. Rachel returns to Tree Hill for a vacation and tries to apologize to Brooke for stealing money from her by giving her a cheque with interest, but Brooke slaps her and tells her to stay away. When she gets home to find that Julian is still with Alex, she cries in front of her bathroom mirror and says to herself "Why can't you be the one who gets the baby and the boy?" before throwing her birth control pills in the garbage. However, it is revealed that the doctor not only told Brooke she isn't pregnant, but that she can never get pregnant. She tells this to Julian who feels guilty he wasn't there.. She also battles with Millicent after she demands to be paid $500,000 for being the face of Clothes Over Bros (which she has become after Alex got fired), which hurts Brooke after all she's done for Millie and how ungrateful she's being despite of that. She tells Victoria about her problems with Millicent and how those problems are because of Alex's influence, and Victoria says she will "take care of Alex". Brooke is furious when Julian confides Alex that she can't have kids and that he wants kids. After talking with Victoria about the situation, Victoria helps her realize that Julian might not be the one for her, and she asks Julian to take another movie because she wants time to be alone with herself before she can trust him again. Julian calls her after he finds Alex in her bathtub after slitting her wrists, and she goes to the hospital to support her now estranged boyfriend. After finding out about Millicent's actions Brooke fires her and tells her to get help.
