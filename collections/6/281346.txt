There is an unabridged audio book read by White himself which reappeared decades after it had originally been recorded.[32] Newsweek writes that White reads the story "without artifice and with a mellow charm," and that "White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don't listen (at least, not to the sad parts) while driving."[32] Joe Berk, president of Pathway Sound, had recorded Charlotte's Web with White in White’s neighbor's house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable experience) and released the book in LP.[33] Bantam released Charlotte’s Web alongside Stuart Little on CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired the two of them for rather a large amount.[33]
