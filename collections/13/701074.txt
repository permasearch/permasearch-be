The channel also produces some original programming, which (as of April 2016[update]) includes shows such as Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters, Switched at Birth, Stitchers, Shadowhunters, Young & Hungry, and Baby Daddy. Until the debuts of Melissa & Joey (which ran from 2010 to 2015), and Baby Daddy (which ran from 2012 to 2017), Freeform (as ABC Family) had long faced minimal success with its original sitcoms, with its drama series often outlasting its comedies.
