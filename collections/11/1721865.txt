In 2002, Honda Canada, in recognition of the one millionth sale of the Civic in Canada, introduced a limited edition version of the Civic called the Civic Coupe Si Veloz ('Veloz' meaning 'swift' in Spanish). The Veloz edition adds a front, rear, and side skirts, rear spoiler, carbon fibre trim pieces, chrome exhaust tip, custom Veloz embroidered floor mats and Veloz badges.[4]
