Pepperidge Farm, a sister company of Arnott's, began importing the Tim Tam to the United States of America in 2008.[6] The Tim Tams are still "Made in Australia" and packaging in the United States bears the slogan "Australia's Favorite Cookie." In 2017, an additional flavour, dark chocolate-mint, was produced for and introduced only in the American market.[7]
