In 2009, a Chinese manufacturer, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, announced that it would acquire Hummer, pending government approvals, but later withdrew its bid.[2] On February 24, 2010, Reuters reported that the Chinese ministry of commerce had prevented the deal,[3] although a ministry spokesperson denied rejecting the application, which had been stalled for eight months.[4] At the end of February, General Motors announced it would begin dismantling the Hummer brand.[5]
