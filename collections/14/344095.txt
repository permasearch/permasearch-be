Amsterdam becomes attracted to pickpocket and grifter Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is infatuated. Amsterdam's interest is dampened, however, upon learning that she was once Bill's ward and still enjoys his affections. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and Bill becomes his mentor, involving him in the dealings of corrupt Tammany Hall politician William M. Tweed. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt, and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion. Jenny nurses Bill's wounds, and she and Amsterdam have a furious argument which dissolves into passionate lovemaking. Bill speaks to Amsterdam of the downfall of civilization and how he has maintained power through the spectacle of violence and fear. He says that Priest Vallon was his last worthy enemy, and that the Priest once beat him but spared his life, leaving him ashamed, which gave him the strength of will to return and fight for his own authority.
