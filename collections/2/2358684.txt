In 2002, Archos released the first "portable media player" (PMP), the Archos Jukebox Multimedia[29] with a little 1.5" colour screen. Manufacturers have since implemented abilities to view images and play videos into their devices. The next year, Archos released another multimedia jukebox, the AV300, with a 3.8" screen and a 20GB hard drive.
