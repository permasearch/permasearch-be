The original alignment of US 17 through town, Ehringhaus Street became the business route in 1969 with the creation of US 17 Bypass (Hughes Boulevard). Ehringhaus Street is home to numerous familiar national and regional chain stores and restaurants, including those housed in Southgate Mall, the only enclosed shopping mall in northeastern North Carolina. Ehringhaus Street bridges the other shopping districts, connecting Downtown Elizabeth City at its eastern end to the Halstead and Hughes Boulevard corridors toward its western terminus.
