According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, "exchanging fire for an hour".[122] A subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter period of time.[123] The suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured.[124] He was arrested at 8:42Â p.m.[125][126] and taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition[127] with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand.[128]
