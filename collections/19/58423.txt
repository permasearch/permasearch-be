The "zombie idea" developed by George Romero does not exist in The Walking Dead alternate universe; hence, of all the myriad terms used to describe the undead by different communities throughout the show, the word "zombie" has been deliberately avoided. While it has been used extremely rarely in the comics, it has never been used in the show.
