In November 2016, the Facebook page for Black Mirror shared an article in The Washington Post about Social Credit System, a rating system proposed by the government of China;[note 1] in Den of Geek!, Rob Leane notes that this is very similar to the rating system that appears in "Nosedive".[29] The Sesame Credit app was launched by Ant Financial in December 2017, leading to further comparisons to the episode.[30][31][32] Sesame Credit rewards users that, based on a rating derived from social media discovery tools and other Big Data patterns alongside financial credit ratings, are loyal to China, its government, and its brands through better loan rates and other services, while those that have their rating fall below a threshold are unable to procure some services.[33] Brooker joked, "I promise you we didn't sell the idea to the Chinese government!" About seeing the concept of the episode come to life in the real world, Brooker said, "It was quite trippy".[34] Brooker comments that a key difference between China's rating system and the one in "Nosedive" is that "that there's a central government assessing things. Being state-controlled, it feels even more sinister", and also points out that Social Credit System "sounds like an attempt to make the population behave in a particular way".[35]
