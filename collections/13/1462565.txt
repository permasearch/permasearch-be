During the Crusades, there were in fact too many armored knights in France for the land to support. Some scholars believe that one of the driving forces behind the Crusades was an attempt by such landless knights to find land overseas, without causing the type of internecine warfare that would largely damage France's increasing military strength.[21] However, such historiographical work on the Crusades is being challenged and rejected by a large part of the historical community. The ultimate motivation or motivations for any one individual are difficult to know, but regardless, nobles and knights from France generally formed very sizeable contingents of crusading expeditions.[22] Crusaders were so predominantely French that the word "crusader" in the Arabic language is simply known as Al-Franj or "The Franks"[3] and Old French became the lingua franca of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.[4]
