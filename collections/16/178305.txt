The voyage is the longest passage made by a Mormon emigrant company. The ship Brooklyn sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around Cape Horn, stopping at the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, then to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), finally docking in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.
