Ahmir Khalib Thompson was born in Philadelphia on January 20, 1971. His father was Lee Andrews of Lee Andrews & the Hearts, a 50s doo-wop group.[3] His mother, Jacquelin Thompson, together with his father, was also part of the Philadelphia-based soul group Congress Alley.[4] His parents did not want to leave him with babysitters, so they took him on tour with them.[5] He grew up in backstages of doo-wop shows. By the age of seven, Thompson began drumming on stage at shows, and by 13, had become a musical director.
