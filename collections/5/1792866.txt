Buddy Love is often interpreted as a lampoon of Lewis' former show business partner Dean Martin. Lewis, however, has consistently denied this. In his 1982 autobiography and again in a DVD featurette entitled The Nutty Professor: Making The Formula, Lewis stated that the character was based on every obnoxious self-important hateful hipster he ever knew. In the DVD commentary, Lewis speculates that he perhaps should have made Love more evil â€” since to his surprise more fan mail came for Love than for the professor. Film critic Danny Peary has made the claim in his 1981 book Cult Movies that the character of Love is actually the real counterpart of Jerry Lewis. Lewis has stated that the two represented good and evil.[7]
