During Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference on June 15, 2015, Microsoft announced plans to introduce Xbox 360 backward compatibility on the Xbox One at no additional cost.[10] Supported Xbox 360 games will run within an emulator and have access to certain Xbox One features, such as recording and broadcasting gameplay.[11] Games do not run directly from discs. A ported form of the game is downloaded automatically when a supported game is inserted, while digitally-purchased games will automatically appear for download in the user's library once available.[10] As with Xbox One titles,[12] if the game is installed using physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes.[10][11]
