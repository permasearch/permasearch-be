The game increases in difficulty as you progress up the mountain. There are no checkpoints; the player is at a constant risk of losing some or all of their progress.[7] The game concludes when a player reaches the highest point of the map and then enters space. Upon reaching the conclusion, a message asks players if they are recording the game play. When a player indicates they are not, the game provides access to a chatroom populated by other players who have completed the game.
