Wilhelm Hofmeister demonstrated the morphological alternation of generations in plants,[9] between a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing generation (gametophyte).[10][11] By that time, a debate emerged focusing on the origin of the asexual generation of land plants (i.e., the sporophyte) and is conventionally characterized as a conflict between theories of antithetic (Čelakovský, 1874) and homologous (Pringsheim, 1876) alternation of generations.[8] Čelakovský coined the words sporophyte and gametophyte.[citation needed]
