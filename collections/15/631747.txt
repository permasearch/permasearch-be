Another ownership group interested in starting a Montgomery-based bowl at Alabama State's stadium has reportedly switched focus to Charleston, South Carolina. In the face of obstacles related to a NCAA ban on playing postseason games at predetermined locations in South Carolina due to the Confederate battle flag being flown at a civil war monument on the State House grounds, the ownership group instead chose to stage the Medal of Honor Bowl all-star game at Johnson Hagood Stadium beginning in 2014.[24] However, with the Confederate flag's removal from the State House grounds on July 10, 2015, the NCAA lifted its ban that day.[25] As such, on August 27 of that year, the Medal of Honor Bowl announced their plans to become a traditional postseason bowl game beginning on December 18, 2016, pending NCAA approval. The all-star game format was not played that year as a result.[26] However, in April 2016, the NCAA announced a moratorium on new bowl games;[12] organizers have subsequently announced plans to hold the bowl (as an all-star game again) in January 2018.[27]
