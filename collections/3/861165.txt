The "Law of Manu" was cited favorably by Friedrich Nietzsche, as he deemed it to "be incomparably spiritual and superior work" to the Christian Bible,[94] and he endorsed the political exclusion that Manu's system was considered to bring.[95] Nietzsche furthermore considered the caste system to be a good idea, and stated that "caste-order, order of rank is just a formula for the supreme law of life itself", a "natural order, lawfulness par excellence",[96][97] adding that, "to prepare a book of law in the style of Manu means to give a people the right to become master one day, to become perfect, - to aspire to the highest art of life."[97]
