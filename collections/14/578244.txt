Sales at Grace Brothers are getting incredibly low, so Old Mr Grace decides to either cut the staff's wages by 10%, or move them into the bargain basement. The staff are so annoyed, they come into work late and hold a roof top protest. After failing to write a slogan on the wall of the store, their protest is quickly cut short as a fire breaks out in the store.
