Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolutions of 1848.[107] In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.[107] Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000[108] or 5,000 francs[109][110] he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.[110] Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,[108][111] the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.[110][112]
