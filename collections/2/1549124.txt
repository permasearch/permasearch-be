Shaw witnessed her father's death in an automobile accident at a young age but did not exhibit typical emotional reactions to it. In her first appearance, she claims that she has alexithymia, making her unable to feel and/or express common human emotions like fear or sadness.[3] Shaw once trained as a surgeon; although very technically capable, she was criticized by her superiors for her indifference and lack of sensitivity to her patients and it is implied that she was removed from the program before she could complete her surgical training because of these emotional characteristics.  She is capable of deducing emotionally correct actions, such as rescuing Fusco's son rather than Fusco (S3 Ep9, "The Crossing") and taking on Genrika as her unofficial ward (S3 Ep5, "Razgovor"). She unexpectedly reveals human emotion by passionately kissing Root before sacrificing herself to save the team (S4 Ep11, "If-Then-Else").
