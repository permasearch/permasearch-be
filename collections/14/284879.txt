On Christmas Eve, Zedd and Rita send their troops to the North Pole to capture Santa Claus and his elves, thus preventing Santa from delivering his Christmas presents. Meanwhile, Kimberly misses her parents, who won't be able to go home for Christmas. The Rangers go to the rescue, but realize they can't use their morphers to fight Rito, Goldar, and the Tengas. After easily tying Goldar, Rito, and the Tengas with a red ribbon, Santa Claus sends them as a present to Zedd and Rita. Zedd and Rita are angry. Meanwhile, the Rangers go back home - before they do, however, Santa gives them a bag of gifts to take back to Angel Grove to give to the kids at Ernie's Juice Bar, where Kimberly and a group of children are going to be singing Christmas songs. Throughout the episode, there is a girl who is in the singing group, who is not to eager about this because her father won't be there to see it, all she wants to do is be with him, so she tells her to makes friends and she does with Kimberly. The girl's father show's up, and Kimberly's parents come for Christmas. Meanwhile, Zedd and Rita, Goldar, Rito, and the others are enjoying Christmas, and Rito gives a present to Goldar and says Goldar is Rito's best friend. In the end, Kimberly, the rangers, Bulk and Skull, who had earlier told the girl that if they saw Santa they'd tell him to have her father come, Kimberly's parents, the music group, and most of the people at Ernie's Juice Bar sing together.
