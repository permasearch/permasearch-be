Death Stranding is an action game set in an open world environment, which also includes multiplayer functions.[2][3] Kojima compared the genre to how his earlier game Metal Gear – now considered as a stealth game – was called an action game during its release because the stealth genre was not considered to exist at the time.[4][5]
