English names for fields of study are usually created by taking a root (the subject of the study) and appending the suffix logy to it with the interconsonantal o placed in between (with an exception explained below). For example, the word dermatology comes from the root dermato plus logy.[3] Sometimes, an excrescence, the addition of a consonant, must be added to avoid poor construction of words.
