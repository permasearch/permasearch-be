The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics. IGN.com said of the song that it "lopes along to a feel good melancholic guitar strum while [Simpson] waxes like any lovelorn 19-year old would about the current love of their life."[6] Another review said that the "stringy" guitar riffs in "Pieces of Me" were "simple, yet effective," with the "catchy chorus bringing the song to life."[7] According to one review of the album, Simpson's singing on the track goes from "impassioned wail to innocent cooing ably."[8] A UK review of the single called it "palatable" "as guitar-led lipstick confessionals go".[9] It has also been described as a "perfect choice" for the album's first single, having "a tempo between fast and slow, with hints of both throughout the song."[10]
