The program was launched in late February 2006, and ended in late June 2017.[3] By November 2006, over a million prizes had been redeemed.[4] The program had since been extended annually since its inception, but terminated on June 30, 2017. Any points left over from one year by one member carried over into the next, provided the member had accrued or debited points within a 90-day period. Current members had from late March to late June 2017 to redeem any points accumulated over the years. Leftover points were then donated to charity.[5] In September 2013, the My Coke Rewards Beta was launched.[6] The new system which ran on the same website, but with /beta after the .com on the address, used social media challenges and My Coke Rewards codes to gain "status" points to level up, with +5 status points just by creating an account.[7] The levels were bronze, silver, and gold, which replaced the test phase levels of Red, Gold, and Twilight, and points or status were rewarded when a user leveled up.[6] The "status" points were discontinued in mid-June 2016. The program ended in late June 2017.
