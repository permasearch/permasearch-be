The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing genres. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels the overworld, a large outdoor map with various environments.[9] While the player begins the game armed only with a small shield, a tantalizing cave immediately beckons them within, where a sword is entrusted to Link by an old man for use as their primary weapon; With the auspicious first message, “IT’S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS”.[14] Throughout the adventure, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues, mainly found in caves scattered throughout the land; Some easily accessible, and others  hidden beneath obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls.[15]
