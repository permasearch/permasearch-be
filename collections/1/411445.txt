In 1967, Brian Clough and Peter Taylor took over and led them to their greatest glory. Having clinched the influential signing of Dave Mackay, Derby were promoted to the First Division in 1969, finished fourth in 1970,[6] were banned from competing in Europe due to financial irregularities in 1971 and won their first ever Football League Championship in 1972.[6] Though Derby did not retain their title the following season, they did reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they lost to Juventus. Clough's frequent outspoken comments against football's establishment eventually led to him falling out with the board of directors at the club, and Clough and Taylor left in October 1973. Such was their impact on the club that, 37 years later, a 9Â ft (2.75 metres) bronze statue of the pair was erected outside Pride Park in commemoration of their legacy.[8]
