General Philip Schuyler learned of the retreat from Oriskany and immediately organized additional relief to be sent to the area.  The siege at Fort Stanwix was eventually lifted on August 21 when a relief column approached, led by General Benedict Arnold.  While still at Fort Dayton, Arnold sent messengers into the British camp who convinced the British and Indian besiegers that his force was much larger than it actually was.[33]
