In contract law, a warranty has various meanings but generally means a guarantee or promise[1] which provides assurance by one party to the other party that specific facts or conditions are true or will happen. This factual guarantee may be enforced regardless of materiality[2] which allows for a legal remedy if that promise is not true or followed.
