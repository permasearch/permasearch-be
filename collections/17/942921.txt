Geddy Lee's high-register vocal style has always been a signature of the band – and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially during the early years of Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin.[99][134] A review in The New York Times opined Lee's voice "suggests a munchkin giving a sermon".[135] Although his voice has softened, it is often described as a "wail".[134][136] His instrumental abilities, on the other hand, are rarely criticized. He has cited Jeff Berlin, Jack Casady, John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Chris Squire as the bassists who had the biggest impact on his playing style.[137] An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and ability on the bass guitar have proven influential in the rock and heavy metal genres, inspiring such players as Steve Harris of Iron Maiden,[138] John Myung of Dream Theater,[139] Les Claypool of Primus,[140] and Cliff Burton of Metallica[141] among others. Lee is notable for his ability to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously. This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, sing, manipulate keyboards, and trigger foot pedals as in the song "Tom Sawyer".[88] Because of this, he remains in one place during songs with complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.
