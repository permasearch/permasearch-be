Although not approved for this indication, studies such as STAR*D have shown buspirone to be an effective augmentation agent alongside treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for clinical depression and is also used to counter the sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction) associated with SSRIs.[18][19][20][21] The drug has also been found to be effective in the treatment of depression as a standalone drug.[10]
