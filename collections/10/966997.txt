Not all of the attention was positive. In a 2013 series of reviews of cosmic Marvel storylines for Multiversity Comics, Drew Bradley felt that the story was only great if read in its entirety. At that time, the collected edition of act one was out of print, and most of act two had not been reprinted in any form. He felt the story would not live up to its hype if readers skipped the lead-in material.[75] Mark Ginocchio enumerated ten reasons he felts the series was overrated on the pop culture website What Culture. He said the transition from PÃ©rez to Lim was jarring for a reader, describing it as "neither seamless nor unnoticeable".[51] He also regretted that The Infinity Gauntlet overshadows Starlin's earlier Thanos stories, which Ginocchio felt were superior.[76] Writing for Digital Spy, Hugh Armitage complained that the comic lacked real consequences, calling it "essentially [...] a really bizarre love story".[77]
