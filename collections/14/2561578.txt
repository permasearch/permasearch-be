In April 2007 the county formed the special-purpose King County Ferry District to take over operations of both the West Seattle and Vashon Island passenger-only ferries. The district is funded through a property tax levied on all property in the county.[9] The ferry district took over operation of the West Seattle/Downtown Seattle route from King County Metro on April 27, 2008.[10]
