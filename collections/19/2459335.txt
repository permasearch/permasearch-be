Baker atoned for his first-inning error by connecting for a three-run homer in the third off Yankee starter Mike Torrez. The Yankees regained the lead with single runs in the fourth and fifth on an RBI groundout by Rivers, who finished the game with three hits (including two doubles), and an RBI single by Chris Chambliss. Torrez settled into a groove after Baker's home run, shutting out the Dodgers for the rest of the way. Torrez finished with nine strikeouts in the complete-game win.
