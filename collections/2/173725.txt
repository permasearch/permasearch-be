The U.S. was ranked the 41st worst among 141 countries (30th percentile) on income equality measured by the Gini index.[4] The UN, CIA World Factbook,[200] and OECD have used the Gini index to compare inequality between countries, and as of 2006, the United States had one of the highest levels of income inequality among similar developed or high income countries, as measured by the index.[18] While inequality has increased since 1981 in two-thirds of OECD countries[201][202] most developed countries are in the lower, more equal, end of the spectrum, with a Gini coefficient in the high twenties to mid thirties.[203]
