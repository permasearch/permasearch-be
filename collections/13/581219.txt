Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of phosphorus which occupies the same group (column) of the periodic table. The most common oxidation states for arsenic are: −3 in the arsenides, which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the arsenites, and +5 in the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As3− 4 ions in the mineral skutterudite.[16] In the +3 oxidation state, arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons.[8]
