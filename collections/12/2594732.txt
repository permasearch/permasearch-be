The Akosombo Dam benefited some industrial and economic activities from the addition of lake transportation, increased fishing, new farming activities along the shoreline, and tourism.[5]  The power generated has provided for primary interests within Ghana, while also supplying power to the neighboring countries of Togo and Benin.[10]  Ghana’s industrial and economic expansion triggered a higher demand for power, beyond the Akosombo's power plant capabilities.  By 1981, a smaller dam was built at the town of Kpong, downstream from Akosombo and further upgrades to Akosombo have become necessary for maintaining hydropower output.[1]  Initially, the dam’s power production capabilities greatly overreached the actual demand; while, the demand since the dam’s inception has resulted in the doubling of hydropower production.[18] Increasing demands for power exceed what can be provided by the current infrastructure.  Power demands, along with unforeseen environmental trends, have resulted in rolling blackouts and major power outages.[1][18]  An overall trend of lower lake levels has been observed, sometimes below the requirement for operation of the Akosombo Dam.[18]
