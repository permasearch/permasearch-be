Reaction to the show among critics has been mostly positive, though the week it premiered, Alex Pareene, columnist for the left-leaning website Salon.com, slammed it as "boring and lame" and "not even worth getting outraged about."[13] Entertainment Weekly TV critic Ken Tucker dubbed the show his "favorite guilty pleasure" and praised its freewheeling style and zany humor, calling it "a delightfully nutty show with an undercurrent of ragin’ crazy."[14] Mediaite's Frances Martel, examining cable news' shift toward more personality-driven commentary, praised The Five for adding an element of entertainment to the news: "Beyond having opinions, the new generation of cable news talk shows spearheaded by The Five have personalities, characters and character arcs that are worth tuning in for. ... Unlike the previous, host-driven generation of opinion shows, The Five adds a refreshing new element to cable news– a plot."[15] The Daily Show with Jon Stewart would later take that line of thought to strange new places when "correspondent" Samantha Bee debuted her "one-woman show" about the supposed romantic subplot on The Five.[16]
