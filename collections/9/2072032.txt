In 1957, United Artists Records Corporation and United Artists Music Corporation were created after UA failed to buy a record company.[8] In 1968, UA Records was merged with Liberty Records, along with their many subsidiary labels such as Imperial Records and Dolton Records. In 1972, the group was consolidated into one entity as United Artists Records. It was later taken over by EMI and managed by Capitol Records which continues to control the catalog.
