Defined by the National Capital Act,[6] the National Capital Region consists of an area of 4,715 km2 (1,820 sq mi)[7] that straddles the Ottawa River,[7] which serves as the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. This area is smaller than that of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA), which is 6,287 km2 (2,427 sq mi) in size.[3] Ottawa–Gatineau is the only CMA in the nation to fall within two provinces.
