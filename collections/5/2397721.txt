The first efforts to create a corpus of music suitable for a new Jewish entity that would eventually become Israel were in 1882.[25] This was the year of the First Aliyah, the first wave of Jewish immigrants seeking to create a national homeland in Palestine.  As there were no songs yet written for this national movement, Zionist youth movements in Germany and elsewhere published songbooks, using traditional German and other folk melodies with new words written in Hebrew.  An example of this is the song that became Israel's national anthem, "Hatikvah".[26] The words, by the Hebrew poet Naftali Herz Imber, express the longing of the Jewish people to return to the land of Zion.  The melody is a popular eastern European folk melody.
