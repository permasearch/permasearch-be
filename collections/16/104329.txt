In 1976, Cartwright landed a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials on WING radio in Dayton.[4] A representative from Warner Bros. Records visited WING and later sent Cartwright a list of contacts in the animation industry.[8] One of these was Daws Butler, known for voicing characters such as Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Elroy Jetson, Spike the Bulldog and Yogi Bear. Cartwright called him, and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine.[5] Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as "absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite".[9]
