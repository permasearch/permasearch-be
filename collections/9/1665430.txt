Following the Muslim revolution in the Poonch and Mirpur area[83] and Pakistani backed[28]:18 Pashtun tribal intervention from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa aimed at supporting the revolution,[84][85] the Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance. India set the condition that Kashmir must accede to India for it to receive assistance. The Maharaja complied, and the Government of India recognised the accession of the princely state to India. Indian troops were sent to the state to defend it. The Jammu & Kashmir National Conference volunteers aided the Indian Army in its campaign to drive out the Pathan invaders.[86]
