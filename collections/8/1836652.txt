Lara later awakens from a dream reminding her what her father said about the alignment and an object linked to it called the Triangle of Light. Aware of a clock ticking, she searches for it and discovers a secret chamber under the staircase with a carriage clock that had spontaneously begun ticking. Bryce probes it and discovers a strange device hidden inside the clock.
