Filming for series 3 began in November 2012, with an airing date scheduled for May 2013.[33] In November Jones and Sharp were photographed filming on location in Manchester for the series.[33] As the fourth series had a different air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months.[34] A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 was the reason that the fourth series was instead filmed in summer.[34]
