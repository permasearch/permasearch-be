Many listeners[citation needed] detect sexual innuendo in the lyrics, with the key in its lock thought to symbolize sexual intercourse, or in phrases such as "I go pretty far" and "I've been all around the world". Another common viewpoint on the song, is that the song is clearly an innocent reflection upon the typical workings of a child's mind regarding their possessions (In this case, quad skates and the associated key essential for tightening/loosening a locking clamp on the skates).
