"All Night Long (All Night)" is a hit single by American singer-songwriter Lionel Richie from 1983. Taken from his second solo album, Can't Slow Down, it combined Richie's soulful Commodores style with Caribbean influences. This new, more dance music, pop-inspired approach proved popular, as the single reached number one on three Billboard charts (pop, R&B and adult contemporary).[2] Richard Marx contributed backing vocals as an unknown until his 1986 debut album appeared.
