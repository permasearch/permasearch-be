Cleaning events can either be rapid, such as overnight, or over many days where solar power slowly goes up.[4] For example, the MER-A Spirit rover, on April 18, 2009 and April 28, 2009 the power output of the solar arrays were increased by cleaning events.[5][6] The power output of Spirit's solar arrays increased from 223 watt hours per day on March 31, 2009 to 372 watt hours per day on April 29, 2009.[6] Spirit had experienced multiple cleaning events during its operation that aided in its mission extension. However, the lack of cleaning event was noted as a factor in its demise.[7]
