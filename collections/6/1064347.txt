As a result of its small size and high negative charge density, the fluoride anion is the "hardest" base (i.e., of low polarizability). Because of this, fluorides in real salt crystals often have higher effective charges than oxides of the same metal, even though oxygen's formal charge is twice as great as fluorine's.[citation needed]
