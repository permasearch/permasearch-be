Unable to have children of his own, Milton S. Hershey founded the Hershey Industrial School, (Now called Milton Hershey School) in 1909 for white orphaned boys. In 1918, Milton S. Hershey donated all of their considerable wealth, of around $60 million, to the boarding school upon Catherine Hershey's death, in 1915. The Hershey Trust Company is now the largest shareholder and beneficiary to the school. Before his death, Milton Hershey ensured the school would live on by donating 30% of all future Hershey profits to the school. Due to this generous donation by America's largest chocolate company, MHS now has over 12 billion in assets, making it one of the richest schools in the world. Today, the Milton Hershey School provides a free education, health care, clothing, and food in a home like setting to 2000 plus kids in financial need. The school's programs include sports, arts, religious studies, sciences, math, language, and many other subjects. School colors are gold and brown. Students must wear a uniform to class provided to them by the school to encourage equality. Their admissions is primarily based on age and financial need. The school also provides "house parents", who are married couples to care for the kids in the student homes. The school's "fellowship" project provides students with Hershey employee visits to build long-lasting relationships and provide career counseling. Additionally, the school is located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a city created by Milton Hershey himself. Many of its designs resemble Hershey chocolate products, such as the Hershey Kisses street lights. Most notably perhaps is the fact that Mr Hershey prohibited The Hershey Company from using the school as an advertisement or marketing strategy. The school's primary goal is to provide students with the skills necessary to support themselves throughout life.
