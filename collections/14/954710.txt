The academy had originally wanted Streisand to sing "I Finally Found Someone"[6] and asked her,[7] however Streisand declined the opportunity to perform the song at the Oscar ceremony. Various publications speculated that Streisand had snubbed the Academy due to her film not being nominated for Best Picture.[8][9] Natalie Cole was asked to step in to replace her but she became sick just before the show. As a result Streisand offered to resume her role, but Oscar producers had already asked Celine Dion to do it instead. Streisand had been told that Dion had already started rehearsing the song along with Because You Loved Me, which she was also set to perform.[10] The director of the Oscars, Louis Horvitz, said that “Barbra called us after saying no several times, but the ship had sailed”. Meanwhile, Streisand said that Dion would “be wonderful” and that “she can have the butterflies, not me". Streisand ended up taking a bathroom break while Dion performed the song,[11] which led to press speculation of Streisand's divaness[12] and the two singers feuding at the ceremony.[13] Billboard would describe this event as a "faux media scandal".[14] Nevertheless, the singer later apologised[15] and claimed that the performance schedule was not made clear on the program.[16][17] The Record said Streisand's decision not to perform despite being in the audience was an "especially strange development".[18] The pair met during a commercial of the show, wherein Streisand invited her to sing a duet,[19][20] a project that ultimately became Tell Him,[21] which gave her a second Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category for the 1998 ceremony alongside its inspiration I Finally Found Someone.[22][23][24][25]
