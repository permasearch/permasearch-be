On 10 January 2005, Grocon, the firm building Eureka Tower, proposed adding a 53.8 m (176.5 ft) communications mast/observation tower. The proposal is currently before the local planning commission. This mast would be a significant structure, used for providing an adventure climb to the tip of the summit.
