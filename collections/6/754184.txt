The most common NOCSAE test is the drop test. This test uses a 13-pound dummy head full of sensors and a gelatin material. The head and helmet is dropped from a height of 60 at one of the six NOCSAE specified locations on the helmet. These locations include the front, rear, left side, right side, right boss, and left boss. The sensors in the dummy head measure the amount of force that the head experiences. The NOCSAE has certain regulations such as the peak severity index can never more than1200 SI. If a helmet fails to meet these requirements, they do not pass the NOCSAE drop test.[19][20]
