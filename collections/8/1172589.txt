Since 1925, the Chicago Tribune has been housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Tribune Tower is owned by Tribune Media. Tribune Tower once housed the physical storefront of the Chicago Tribune Store, but more recently the store has switched to an online presence.[109]
