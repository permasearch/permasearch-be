The development of the Mohegan Sun casino and 9/11 has caused major demographic changes to the surrounding communities of Montville and Norwich. About 23% of Manhattan Chinatown residents, numbering somewhere around 14,000 relocated to Connecticut and have developed an "unexpected" Chinatown, though the area is not officially labeled as such. The characteristics of these communities have gone from low density "suburban" to higher density, with many houses with unused rooms converted to housing as many as 12 people in what was typically room for four occupants. Also, many of Chinese descent grow vegetables in the front yard, a practice considered unacceptable to some pre-existing demographics, with some incidents sparking racial tensions.[38][39]
