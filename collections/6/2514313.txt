The erythema migrans rash is classically 5 to 6.8 cm in diameter, appearing as an annular homogenous erythema (59%), central erythema (30%), central clearing (9%), or central purpura (2%).[8] Because of the "bull's-eye" description to describe the Lyme disease rash, the condition commonly called ringworm is sometimes confused with Lyme disease.[8] Uncommonly, EM may be less than 5 cm in diameter.[9] Multiple painless EM rashes may occur, indicating disseminated infection.
