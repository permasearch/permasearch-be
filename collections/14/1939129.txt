Worship leaders and songwriters Mack Brock and Chris Brown had an interview with Kevin Davis in Reading, Pennsylvania for a 'Behind the Song' feature published on NewReleaseToday.[13] Mack Brock shared that the song was inspired by a sermon titled "Don't Stop at 6" that Steven Furtick preached at a Hillsong Conference, whereby Matt Redman identified a song concept.[13] Chris Brown, in relation to the song's takeaway message, said "We want people to know that God is faithful."[13]
