Locomotor behavior in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids.[42] Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs;[42][67] slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus;[113] fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs;[42][114] partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, seen in the ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus;[42] and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited by many of the sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus.[2][42] The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer.[2] Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.[65]
