Published feasibility studies have shown that a pacemaker-like device (Rheos® Baroreflex Activation Therapy™, CVRx Inc.) designed to electrically activate the baroreceptors, also known as baroreflex activation therapy, significantly lowers blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. One study published on a group of 16 patients reported an average systolic blood pressure reduction of 34 mmHg after three months of treatment and 35 mmHg after 24 months. A drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg was achieved in 12 of 16 (75%) patients at 2 years, and 5 of 16 (31%) achieved a systolic BP of less than 140 mmHg at 2 years.[1] Results published on a separate group of 10 patients from another feasibility trial reported an average systolic blood pressure reduction of 24 mmHg after three months of treatment.[2] Baroreflex activation therapy devices (BAROSTIM NEO™, CVRx Inc.) have received CE Mark for European sale, but have not received FDA approval for sale in the United States.
