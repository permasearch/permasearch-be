Aunt Enchantra and Aunt Hagatha are two of Samantha's other aunts. They occasionally ride in an antique car called "Macbeth" (sometimes driven by chauffeur Rasputin, other times operating sans driver), which enters the Stephens' home through the wall. Enchantra was played by three different actresses, including Estelle Winwood, while Hagatha was played by five, including Jane Connell, Reta Shaw, and Ysabel MacCloskey.
