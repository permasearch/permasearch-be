Corinthos Coffee is a legitimate coffee import business owned by Sonny Corinthos. The business also doubles as a front for Sonny's dirty dealings, as some of his coffee shipments also carry illegal contraband. From 2006 to 2008, Corinthos Coffee operated out of a local coffee shop in town where many Port Charles residents went to get coffee. The coffee shop was burned down by rival mobster Andrei Karpov in 2008. Corinthos Coffee is now headquartered at the Metro Court Hotel. In addition to the coffee business, Sonny also owns an Italian restaurant named, Pozzulo's. From 2009 to 2013, Pozzulo's served as a front for his mob operation, until Sonny moved his illegal business dealings to his new Corinthos Coffee location at the Metro Court. Sonny turned over management of Pozzulo's to his son Michael, who made plans to turn the restaurant into a legitimate and thriving eatery.
