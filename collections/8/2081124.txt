Pleiotropy in genes has been linked between certain psychiatric disorders as well. Deletion in the 22q11.2 region of chromosome 22 has been associated with schizophrenia and autism.[22] Schizophrenia and autism are caused by the same gene deletion, but manifest very differently from each other. The phenotype the gene produces depends on the stage of life the individual develops the disorder in. Childhood manifestation of the gene deletion is typically associated with autism, while adolescent and later expression of the gene deletion often manifests in schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.[23] Though the disorders are linked by genetics, there is no increased risk found for adult schizophrenia in patients who experienced autism in childhood.[24]
