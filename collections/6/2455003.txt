Sheen worked predominantly in theatre in the 1990s and has since remarked that he will always feel "slightly more at home" on stage. "It's more of an actor's medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you."[19] His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991.[20] He later described the role as "a big break. One day, I was at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour."[21] Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an "excellent" performance[22] while The Observer wrote of "a notable West End debut".[23] In 1992, Sheen's performance in Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination[24] and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him "the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer".[12][25] His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award.[26][27] and was described by The Independent as "quite thrilling".[28] Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in the world premiere of Harold Pinter's Moonlight at the Almeida Theatre[29] and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series Gallowglass.[30]
