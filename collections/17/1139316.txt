In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year. Because of a foot injury he had to resort to a handbike near the end of January 2010. However, on 5 February he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero.[124] By 30 March he broke the existing record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009. On 5 February 2011, Engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days.[125] Ricardo Abad MartÃ­nez, from Spain, later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009,[126] and subsequently 500 marathons in a row, from October 2010 to February 2012.[127]
