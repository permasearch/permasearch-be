Keppel initiated the famous study of race relations in the United States by the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal, deliberately appointing, during 1937, an "outsider" and a non-American to manage the study on the theory that the task should be performed by someone unencumbered by traditional attitudes or earlier conclusions. Widely heralded, Myrdal's book American Dilemma (1944) had no immediate public policy effect, although it was later much cited in legal challenges to segregation. Keppel believed foundations should make the facts available to the public and let them speak for themselves. His cogent writings about philanthropy left a lasting impression on the foundation field and influenced the organization and leadership of many new foundations.
