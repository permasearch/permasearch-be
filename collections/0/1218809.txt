In Game 4, the Giants sent 21-year-old rookie Madison Bumgarner to the hill against the Rangers' Tommy Hunter. Bumgarner was brilliant for San Francisco, hurling eight shutout innings while allowing only three hits. Bumgarner allowed only one Ranger to reach second base. A two-run homer by Aubrey Huff in the third inning off Hunter was enough for the Giants win. The other two runs were scored on a run-scoring double by AndrÃ©s Torres in the seventh and a home run to dead center by Buster Posey in the eighth. Bumgarner also became the fifth youngest pitcher to start a World Series game, and the fourth youngest to win one. Bumgarner and Posey were the first rookie battery to start a World Series game since Spec Shea and Yogi Berra in 1947.[13][14]
