Zahn attended Gustavus Adolphus College for one semester but dropped out after seeing the original West End production of Les Misérables. "I remember sitting through the second act thinking, I’m good as that guy standing on the barricade," Zahn recalled. "I wanted to be part of the circus."[4] In 1987, Zahn made his professional stage debut in a Minnesota production of Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues after falsely claiming to be a member of Actors' Equity.[2] His fellow actors suggested that Zahn study acting, inspiring him to enroll in American Repertory Theater's two-year training program.[5] At A.R.T., he worked with the venerated stage director Andrei Șerban.[6]
