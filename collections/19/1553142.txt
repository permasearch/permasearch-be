Ocean Gyre: The fact that the westerlies and trade winds blow in opposite directions and that the continents prevent water from circling the globe contributes to the formation of circular ocean currents, clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis force also plays a part. The trade winds push water west. At the doldrums it flows back east producing the equatorial countercurrent. See Ocean gyre.
