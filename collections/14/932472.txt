During the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Carter performed a memorable dunk when he jumped over 7-foot-2-inch (2.18 m) French center Frédéric Weis. Teammate Jason Kidd said it was "One of the best plays I've ever seen." The French media later dubbed it "le dunk de la mort" ("the Dunk of Death").[123] The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal that year and Carter led the team with 14.8 points per game. Carter admitted he channeled his frustrations in his personal life and Tracy McGrady leaving the Raptors before the Olympics.[124]
