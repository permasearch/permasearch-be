This is a list of units that are not defined as part of the International System of Units (SI), but are otherwise mentioned in the SI,[1][2] because either the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) accepts their use as being multiples or submultiples of SI-units, they have important contemporary application worldwide, or are otherwise commonly encountered worldwide.
