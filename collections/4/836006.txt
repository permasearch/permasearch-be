In "There's a Storm Coming", Wallace and Clyde trick Alan out of the other half of the Dyad of Nebulon that Horace holds. Upon forcing the location of Mighty Med out of Alan and leaving him bound and gagged, Wallace and Clyde rejoin Horace's piece of the dyad with theirs at Mighty Med's entrance and joined together as Catastrophe to seek revenge on Horace. When he finds Horace, Catastrophe gets out of Horace's freeze trap and destroys the weapon that Horace would use in the event of Catastrophe's attack. Due to the reactor going nova, Catastrophe's powers were disabled as Alan breaks the dyad in half, regressing Catastrophe back to Wallace and Clyde. When Wallace and Clyde try to persuade Alan use the dyad's powers to become more powerful than he ever wanted to be and to give Wallace and Clyde a continent to rule over, as long as it's not Australia, Alan throws the Dyad of Nebulon pieces into the reactor, stating that it's too much work. Afterward, Wallace and Clyde are arrested by the Mighty Med security team, along with Megahertz and Experion.
