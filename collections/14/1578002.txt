The Times of India gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote Idharkuthaane Aasaipattai Balakumara lacks the sophistication of a Soodhu Kavvum or Pizza but makes up for it in sheer likeability. His debut Rowthiram was an uneven effort but in Idhaaba, Gokul is more sure-footed, deftly weaving plotlines and confidently untying the knots in his script".[23] IANS gave 3.5 out of 5 and wrote Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara (IAB) doesn't merely entertain, but also addresses a domestic issue with a very strong dose of humour. It's undoubtedly one of the smartest yet funniest Tamil films in recent times.[24] Behindwoods gave 3.25 stars and stated "Idharkuthaane Aasaipattai Balakumara is not an adhesive that keeps you glued on the seat, but is a spring that might make you bounce with laughter".[25] The critics from Sify.com mentioned "Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara (IAB) is a good fun ride. It is a comedy film laced with black humour and works due to its smart writing."[26] Rediff gave 3 out of 5 stars, wrote "Director Gokul in his film, Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara has created some weird, quirky and offbeat characters in hilarious situations who keep the audience entertained, writes" and called it a "laugh riot".[27] Oneindia gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Director Gokul has done a good job in making the film a worth entertainer. His screenplay, though has jerks at parts, is good and the introductory scene gets a special mention" and called the film "a one time watchable movie".[28]
