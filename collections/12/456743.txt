A few miles north of the Gaviota Tunnel, SR 1 splits from US 101 and heads northwest, running along the Pacific coastline parallel and to the west of US 101. US 101 passes through Buellton, Los Alamos, Orcutt, Santa Maria, and Nipomo. South of Santa Maria, US 101 widens from a four-lane highway to a six-lane freeway. SR 166 joins US 101 for about 3 miles (4.8 km) before splitting just north of the city limits, while US 101 continues as a four-lane freeway before reverting to expressway status north of Nipomo.
