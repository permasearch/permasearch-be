Modulation of affect The ego performs this function by preventing painful or unacceptable emotional reactions from entering conscious awareness, or by managing the expression of such feelings in ways that do not disrupt either emotional equilibrium or social relationships.  To adequately perform this function, the ego constantly monitors the source, intensity, and direction of feeling states, as well as the people toward whom feelings will be directed.  Monitoring determines whether such states will be acknowledged or expressed and, if so, in what form.  The basic principle to remember in evaluating how well the ego manages this function is that affect modulation may be problematic because of too much or too little expression.   As an integral part of the monitoring process, the ego evaluates the type of expression that is most congruent with established social norms.  For example, in white American culture it is assumed that individuals will contain themselves and maintain a high level of personal/vocational functioning except in extremely traumatic situations such as death of a family member, very serious illness or terrible accident.  This standard is not necessarily the norm in other cultures (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011).
