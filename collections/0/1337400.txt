Amorsolo is best known for his illuminated landscapes,[5] which often portrayed traditional Filipino customs, culture, fiestas and occupations. His pastoral works presented "an imagined sense of nationhood in counterpoint to American colonial rule" and were important to the formation of Filipino national identity.[1]  He was educated in the classical tradition and aimed "to achieve his Philippine version of the Greek ideal for the human form."[6]  In his paintings of Filipina women, Amorsolo rejected Western ideals of beauty in favor of Filipino ideals[7] and was fond of basing the faces of his subjects on members of his family.[8]
