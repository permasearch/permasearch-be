Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone.[90][91] Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises.[90] Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females.[91][92] In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate.[93] Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication.[74][93] Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males.[74][94] Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call krik, and a louder call resembling a crow's caw.[95] When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus.[74][94]
