Sytner sold The Cavern Club to Ray McFall in 1959 and moved to London.[1] Blues bands and Beat groups began to appear at the club on a regular basis in the early 1960s. The first Beat night was held on 25 May 1960 and featured a performance by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes (which included Ringo Starr as drummer). By early 1961, Bob Wooler had become the full-time compÃ¨re and organiser of the lunchtime sessions.[citation needed]
