Differences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of Gunsmoke. In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholicâ€”at least in the program's early years. On radio's Gunsmoke, Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore.[30] He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.
