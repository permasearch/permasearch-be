The book speculates that Saruman commands various hybrids of Orcs and Men, including in the Shire. Some of these, called "half-orcs" in The Two Towers, were sallow-skinned, squint-eyed, and as tall as men. Merry describes them as "horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces". An account of the first Battle of the Fords of Isen in Unfinished Tales clearly treats Uruk-hai and "orc-men" separately.
