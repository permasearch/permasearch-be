The harm to a child from PCE has implications for public policy and law. Some US states have pressed charges against pregnant women who use drugs, including assault with a deadly weapon, corruption of a minor, manslaughter, child abuse, and distribution of drugs to a minor.[48] However these approaches have generally been rejected in the courts on the basis that a fetus is not legally a child.[38] Between 1985 and 2001, more than 200 women in over 30 US states faced prosecution for drug use during pregnancy.[40] In South Carolina, a woman who used crack in her third trimester of pregnancy was sentenced to prison for eight years when her child was born with cocaine metabolites in its system.[38] The Supreme Court of South Carolina upheld this conviction.[38] As of 2013, all but one of the women prosecuted in the US for drug use while pregnant have won their cases on appeal.[48]
