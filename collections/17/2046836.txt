The right thumb operates four keys. The top key is used to produce B♭2 and B♭3, and is used in B4, C4, D4, F4, and E♭4. The large circular key, otherwise known as the "pancake key", is held down for all the lowest notes from E1 down to B♭1. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in Ravel's "Boléro", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G4. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G4, but with the E1 key (pancake key). The next key operated by the right thumb is known as the "spatula key": its primary use is to produce F♯1 and F♯2. The bottom key is used less often: is used to produce A♭1 (G♯1) and A♭2 (G♯2), when the tone may be improved by combining this with the backmost key E♭1 of the right hand little finger: this is most advantageous in pieces like Dukas's "The Sorcerer's Apprentice".
