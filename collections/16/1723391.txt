Meanwhile, the player must also cater to various survival game aspects as balancing hunger, thirst and fatigue, but also unusual ones such as urine and dirtiness. For nutrition, the player can buy food and beer from the store or drink water directly from faucets, fatigue can be restored by sleeping or by drinking coffee in a pub, the player can freely urinate anywhere, and dirtiness must be decreased thanks to a shower. Drinking too much beer (or hard liquor) will eventually get the player drunk, which first causes the player to waver and their vision to distort, but eventually the player can pass out and wake up at a random place on the map the next day. Police traffic stops randomly spawn along the main road of the in-game world, issuing fines for speeding or drink-driving violations; if the player fails to pay for a fine, police officers will eventually surround player character's home to arrest him and imprison him in jail for a period of time scaled based on the cost of the fine. In recent experimental updates, the player can now use a sauna to get rid of stress, drinking vodka, or, smoke cigarettes. Failing to do so will lead to an increase of stress that eventually can kill you.
