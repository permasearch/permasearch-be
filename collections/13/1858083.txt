The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System included a highway along I-94's route in Michigan.[38] This highway was included on the 1955 plan for the "National System of Interstate and Defense Highways" with a proposed spur in the Battle Creek area.[39] The modern I-94 was numbered I-92 between Benton Harborâ€“St. Joseph and Detroit with I-77 from Detroit to Port Huron in the August 1957 plans.[40]
