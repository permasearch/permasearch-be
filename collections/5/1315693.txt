Estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, as well as GH/IGF-1, produce their effects on breast development by modulating the local expression in breast tissue of an assortment of autocrine and paracrine growth factors,[20][39][57][58][59] including IGF-1, IGF-2, amphiregulin,[60] EGF, FGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),[61] tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), tumor necrosis factor β (TNF-β), transforming growth factor α (TGF-α),[62] transforming growth factor β (TGF-β),[63] heregulin,[64] Wnt,[35] RANKL,[35] and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).[35] These factors regulate cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation via activation of intracellular signaling cascades that control cell function, such as Erk, Akt, JNK, and Jak/Stat.[10][65][66][67]
