There is a modified version of the game called "Thoughtful Solitaire", in which the identity of all 52 cards is known.  Because the only difference between the two games (Klondike and Thoughtful) is the knowledge of card location, all Thoughtful games with solutions will also have solutions in Klondike. Similarly, all dead-ends in Thoughtful will be dead ends in Klondike.[7]  However, the theoretical odds of winning a standard game of non-Thoughtful Klondike are currently not known exactly. The inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as "one of the embarrassments of applied probability".[12]
