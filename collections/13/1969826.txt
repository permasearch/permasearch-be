Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San Diego to La Mesa was originally built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass of the old US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard.[32] Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960,[33] and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962.[34] Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce.[35] In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed.[30][31] By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard was one of the first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.[36]
