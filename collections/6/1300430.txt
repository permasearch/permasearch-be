The planning of the Sullivan Expedition began in 1778 as a way to respond to the Iroquois victories and massacres.[42] This plan came about from the complaints of New Yorkers at the Continental Congress.[45] The New Yorkers had suffered from the massive Iroquois offensives from 1777 to 1778, and they wanted revenge. Besides the brutal battles described previously, the New Yorkers were especially concerned with Joseph Brant. Joseph Brant had Mohawk parents and British lineage, and at a young age, he was taken under the superintendent for Indian affairs.[46] Brant grew to be a courteous and well-spoken man, and he took up the fight for the British because of harassment and discrimination from the Americans during the lead-up to the American Revolution.[47] Thus, Brant formed a military group known as Brant's Volunteers, which consisted of Mohawks and Loyalists.[47] Brant and his band of volunteers led many raids against hamlets and farms in New York, especially Tryon County.[45] As a result of Brant's exploits, the Iroquois offensives, and several massacres the Iroquois inflicted against colonial towns, in 1778 the Seneca and other western nations were attacked by United States forces as part of the Sullivan Expedition. George Washington called upon Continental Army General John Sullivan (general) to lead this attack upon the Iroquois.[48] He had received anywhere from 3000 to 4500 soldiers to wreak havoc upon the helpless Iroquois.[42][45] Overall, the Sullivan Expedition wreaked untold havoc and destruction upon the Iroquois lands, as the soldiers "destroy[ed] not only the homes of the Iroquois but their food stocks as well".[49] Seneca woman Mary Jemison recalled how the Continental soldiers "destroyed every article of the food kind that they could lay their hands on".[50] To make matters worse for the Iroquois, an especially hard winter added in 1780 caused more suffering for the downtrodden Iroquois.[51] The Sullivan Expedition highlighted a period of true total war within the American Revolution. The Americans looked to cripple the Iroquois. They accomplished that, but they instilled a deep hatred in the Iroquois warriors.
