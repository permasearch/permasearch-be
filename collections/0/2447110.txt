Although there is much similarity between the modelling of real options and financial options,[11][18] ROV is distinguished from the latter, in that it takes into account uncertainty about the future evolution of the parameters that determine the value of the project, coupled with management's ability to respond to the evolution of these parameters.[19][20] It is the combined effect of these that makes ROV technically more challenging than its alternatives.
