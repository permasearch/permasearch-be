Official statements by the North Korean government attribute the origin of Juche to Kim Il-Sung's experiences in the Anti-Imperialist Youth League in 1930 in his "liberation struggle" against Japan.[4][17] The first documented reference to Juche as an ideology appeared in 1955 in a speech given by Kim Il Sung entitled "On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work". The speech had been delivered to promote a political purge similar to the earlier Yan'an Rectification Movement in China.[18]
