In European countries, regional airports are often classed as airports that don't serve the country's capital/most major city.  Examples of larger regional airports include Barcelona El Prat Airport, Spain and Manchester Airport, England, which are both among Europe's busiest airports and are used by both large and small planes.  In countries like France, Germany, and Sweden, a regional airport is an airport for small planes, even though they go to the national hub, just like flights from larger airports.  Examples of small regional airports include Coventry Airport and Worship Airport. In northern Norway, a country with long distances and many short-runway airports, regional airports are those with flights to a regional hub, not to the capital.
