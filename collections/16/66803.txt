Miners worked at a claim only long enough to determine its potential. If a claim was deemed as low-value—as most were—miners would abandon the site in search for a better one. In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would "claim-jump" the land. "Claim-jumping" meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site.[74][75] Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators.[69][74][75] This often led to heightened ethnic tensions.[76] In some areas the influx of many prospectors could lead to a reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure.[77]
