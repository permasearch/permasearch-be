In "Eggtown", Kate goes on trial for her father's murder.   Jack testifies on her behalf as a character witness.  He lies under oath and tells the court that it was Kate that saved him and the other survivors.  Under cross-examination, he is asked whether he loves the defendant and he replies "Not anymore."  Kate looks crestfallen and demands that Jack's testimony cease.  Kate's mother, the prosecution's star witness, tries to reconcile with Kate, and then decides not to testify.  She is consequently released on ten years probation, provided that she does not leave California.[25] Kate meets ups with Jack after she is released and he confesses to her that he lied on the stand (about no longer loving her) and Kate is delighted.  She invites him to come home with her, but he hesitates because he is not ready to see Aaron (his nephew) again.  In "Something Nice Back Home", Kate is seen living in an established relationship with Jack, who is also acting as a surrogate father for his nephew Aaron. Later, Jack asks Kate to marry him, which she happily accepts. Jack later confronts Kate about her "errands", which involved her meeting with Sawyer's daughter; Clementine and his ex-girlfriend Cassidy. Kate refuses to tell Jack any details about this, as she knows Sawyer would not want anybody else to know. Jack is angered by her secrecy and raises his voice, waking Aaron up. Kate rushes to comfort him then Jack leaves, paranoid, ending their relationship.[27]
