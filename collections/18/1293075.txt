"Jama" means robe and "war" is yard. The base of the Jamawar is mostly resham,  with perhaps an addition of a little polyester. The brocaded parts are woven in similar threads of silk and polyester. Most of the designs seen today are floral, with the kairy  (i.e. the paisley) as the predominant motif.
