Many of the members of the Club of Rome are seen as Elites, and critics argue passages in the book looking at how to unite divided nations by motivating them to rally around a new common fabricated enemy are clear indicators the work is conspiratorial in nature. In one passage the authors conjecture about new needed enemies or rally points for global society, "either a real one or else one invented for the purpose." Critics argue that statements like the previous made the book conspiratorial. Although, this kind of viewpoint can be seen as conspiratorial in one interpretation, it can also be seen as simply a group of well-intentioned geopolitical leaders and academics like Henry Kissinger "thinking outside the box" and exploring how to prevent shortfalls in the global governance models of the nineteenth-century and the twentieth-century like balance of power. The failure of those older models are widely blamed by Henry Kissinger in his 1994 book Diplomacy with leading to the global human catastrophes of the First World War And the Second World War.[2]
