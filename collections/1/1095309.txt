The Romulan Warbird made its first appearance in this episode, with it being the final design of Andrew Probert for the Star Trek franchise, having previously designed both the Enterprise in Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the Enterprise-D for The Next Generation. The double hulled nature of the starship originated in early designs, however the wings were originally vertical rather than horizontal, with the size of the ship made to be deliberately larger than that of the Enterprise.[13]
