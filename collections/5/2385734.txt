In 1971, the band switched labels to Columbia Records and released the hit album A Space in Time, which marked a move toward more commercial material.[12] It featured the group's biggest hit, "I'd Love to Change the World".[12] In late 1972, the group issued their second Columbia album Rock & Roll Music to the World and, in 1973, the live double album Ten Years After Recorded Live. The band subsequently broke up after their final 1974 Columbia album, Positive Vibrations.[12] The members reunited in 1983 to play the Reading Festival,[14] and this performance was later released on CD as The Friday Rock Show Sessions â€“ Live at Reading '83' . In 1988, the members reunited for a few concerts and recorded the album About Time (1989) with producer Terry Manning in Memphis.[11][12] In 1994, they participated in the Eurowoodstock festival in Budapest.
