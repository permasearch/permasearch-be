After injuring his ankle and hand early in the 2006 season, Franklin made his way back to senior level through the VFL, and returned in round 9 against the Sydney Swans. In round 12, he kicked six goals against Richmond, in what was his breakout game. On July 13, 2006, Franklin signed a two-year deal to remain at Hawthorn after being linked with clubs such as Essendon, Fremantle and the West Coast Eagles. Another six-goal game late in the season prompted predictions of Franklin to be the next big-name forward in the AFL.
