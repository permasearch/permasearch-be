Development on the game began after Atlus's success with collaborating with an external developer on the 2012 fighting game Persona 4 Arena, based on the wish to create a collaborative spin-off with the Etrian Odyssey development team and fan demands for a Persona title on the 3DS. The Persona Q development team was made up of staff from the main Persona series and Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan. Series character designer Shigenori Soejima designed the cast's new deformed "chibi" appearances, while the music was composed by Atsushi Kitajoh and Toshiki Konishi with supervision by series composer Shoji Meguro. First announced in 2013 alongside both Persona 4: Dancing All Night and Persona 5, it was the first Persona title to be developed for a Nintendo platform. It released to strong sales and positive reviews from critics, with several enjoying the blend between Persona and Etrian Odyssey's gameplay styles. A sequel, Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, is planned for release on the Nintendo 3DS on November 29, 2018 in Japan.[1]
