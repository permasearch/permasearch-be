Since that time several new tracks have surfaced on various compilations and through County's official website. Many of these tracks, both live and studio recordings, were collected on the Ratcage Records release So New York, including collaborations with Lisa Jackson and former Electric Chairs guitarist Eliot Michaels. A live show, recorded on County's birthday, was released on the 2002 CD Wash Me in the Blood (of Rock & Roll)- Live at Squeeze Box by Fang Records.[18] The CD features a duet on "California Sun" by County and former nemesis "Handsome" Dick Manitoba of The Dictators.
