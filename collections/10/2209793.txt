The highlight of Edwards' playing career occurred in the twelfth game of the 1978 season, in the final seconds of a game against the New York Giants at the Meadowlands on November 19. The Giants led 17–12 and the Eagles had no time-outs remaining; but instead of simply taking the snap from center and taking a knee, Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik attempted to hand the ball off to running back Larry Csonka. However, the ball came loose, and Edwards picked it up and returned it for a touchdown, enabling the Eagles to win 19–17.[3][4] This play became known in Philadelphia as The Miracle at the Meadowlands and in New York City as simply "The Fumble."[5] The Eagles made the playoffs and the Giants finished at 6–10.
