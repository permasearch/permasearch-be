The University of South Carolina campus is home to twenty-five residence halls; the most recently completed hall opened in the fall of 2011. The housing on campus is under the supervision of Department of Student Housing, and quality of life is enhanced through the Residence Hall Association, whose structure was determined by former president and vice president Amanda Pippin and Steve Smith.
