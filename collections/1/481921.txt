New Moon begins on Bella's eighteenth birthday. She dreams about looking much older than Edward Cullen, her boyfriend. During a birthday celebration at the Cullens, Bella gets a small paper cut while unwrapping a present. Edward's brother, Jasper, instinctively thirsting for her blood, launches an attack, though he is stopped. Edward realizes that his relationship with Bella puts her in danger. In a misguided attempt to protect Bella, he convinces her that he no longer loves her and moves away with his family, leaving her heartbroken and depressed for months.
