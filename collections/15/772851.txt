By 1980, the trends towards suburbanization started in the 1950s continued.  This was the second census (see also 1960) to show a decline in the combined total population of the top ten cities, with 1,142,003 (5.2%) fewer people than the 1970 Census' top ten cities. This is the first census in which half of the top ten cities are in the Sun Belt, specifically the West South Central and South Western area of the country.[24]
