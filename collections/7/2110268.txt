In this method, deafness is approached as a cultural, not a medical, issue.[13] In a bilingual-bicultural program, deaf children are recommended to learn sign language such as American Sign Language (ASL) as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language such as English as a second language.[13][14] Bilingual-bicultural programs consider spoken or written language and sign language equal languages, helping children develop age-appropriate fluency in both.[14] The bilingual-bicultural approach believes that since deaf children learn visually, rather than by ear,[13] classes should be conducted in a visual language. To avoid harming the students' accuracy and fluency in either language, sign language and spoken language are not used simultaneously, since they use different grammar, syntax, and vocabulary; sign language is usually used as the language of instruction, though some bilingual-bicultural schools use spoken language in some contexts with some students.[citation needed] Many bilingual-bicultural schools have dormitories; students may either commute to school or stay in a dormitory as part of a residential program, visiting their families on weekends, holidays and school vacations.
