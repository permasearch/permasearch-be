Jammu and Kashmir had a Muslim majority (77% Muslim by the previous census in 1941[12]). Following the logic of Partition, many people in Pakistan expected that Kashmir would join Pakistan.

So many in India too had expectations that Kashmir would join India.[13][14] The Maharaja was faced with indecision.[note 2]
