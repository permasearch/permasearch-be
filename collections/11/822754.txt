In recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a medical tourism destination,[181] and a number of health tourism providers are developing the industry.

Malta is popular with British medical tourists,[182] pointing Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the Trent Accreditation Scheme.
