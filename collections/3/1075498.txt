Knowledge is the common heritage of humanity. Knowledge, like education, must therefore be considered a global common good. If knowledge is considered only a global public good, access to it is often restricted.[51] The current trend towards the privatization of knowledge production, reproduction and dissemination is a cause for serious concern. The knowledge commons is gradually being privatized through law and, more specifically, through the Intellectual Property Rights regime, which dominates knowledge production. The progressive privatization of the production and reproduction of knowledge is evident in the work of universities, think tanks, consultancy firms and publishing. As a result, much of the knowledge considered to be a public good, and which belongs to the knowledge commons, is actually being privatized. This is disturbing, especially when it comes to the ecological and medicinal knowledge of indigenous communities that is being appropriated by global corporations. Some resistance to this trend is emerging among indigenous peoples. It is also producing counter movements of sharing in the digital world.[52]
