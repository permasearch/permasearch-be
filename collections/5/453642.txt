Donald Trump's campaign drew heavily on his personal image, enhanced by his previous media exposure.[187] The primary slogan of the Trump campaign, extensively used on campaign merchandise, was Make America Great Again. The red baseball cap with the slogan emblazoned on the front became a symbol of the campaign, and has been frequently donned by Trump and his supporters.[188] Trump's right-wing populist positions—reported by The New Yorker to be nativist, protectionist, and semi-isolationist—differ in many ways from traditional conservatism.[189] He opposed many free trade deals and military interventionist policies that conservatives generally support, and opposed cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits. Moreover, he has insisted that Washington is "broken" and can only be fixed by an outsider.[190][191][192] Trump support was high among working and middle-class white male voters with annual incomes of less than $50,000 and no college degree.[193] This group, particularly those with less than a high-school education, suffered a decline in their income in recent years.[194] According to The Washington Post, support for Trump is higher in areas with a higher mortality rate for middle-age white people.[195] A sample of interviews with more than 11,000 Republican-leaning respondents from August to December 2015 found that Trump at that time found his strongest support among Republicans in West Virginia, followed by New York, and then followed by six Southern states.[196]
