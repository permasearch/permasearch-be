Because of the secretive nature of the messages, the cryptographic function employed by particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two[31]) cases. It is assumed that most stations use a one-time pad that would make the contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits. In one confirmed case, West Germany did use a one-time pad for numbers transmissions.[32]
