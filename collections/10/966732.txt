Many married women still use the title with their spouse's last name but retaining their first name (e.g., Mrs Jane Smith). Other married women choose not to adopt their spouse's last name at all. It is generally considered polite to address a woman by Ms rather than Mrs, unless the preference of the woman in question is clearly known. This is especially true in written communication, as dictated by professional etiquette. [5]
