MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and house parties.[10] In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.[36] MDMA is used less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.[37]
