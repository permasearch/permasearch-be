While he is in The Waterhole, Hamish notices Tyler Brennan playing pool and joins him for a game. He later turns up at Number 24 and introduces himself, and Tyler realises that Hamish is his father. He tells him to leave. Tyler's brother Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) confronts Hamish, who states that he wants to get to know his son. Tyler later visits Hamish at Lassiter's with his girlfriend Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and they talk. Hamish accepts Tyler's invitation to dine at The Waterhole with him and his brothers, Mark and Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). Hamish reveals that he never met their father Russell, but it emerges that he has the missing ace of spades playing card sent to him by Russell. Hamish gets to know Sheila Canning (Colette Mann). Hamish visits the boat Russell left to Tyler and Aaron, and encourages him to leave a message for Russell on his voicemail, like Aaron is doing. Hamish later pulls out Russell's phone and listens to Tyler's message. Hamish asks if he can stay on the boat, as he does not like the noise from the renovations at the hotel. Hamish continues to charm Sheila, before he meets up with his partner Louise McLeod (Maria Theodorakis) to tell her that he is working hard to secure the boat, so they can leave the country and avoid paying a large tax bill. He also plans to bring Tyler with them. When Tyler tells Hamish of his plans to sell the boat, Hamish convinces him to keep it and fix the engine himself.
