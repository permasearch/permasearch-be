The track was released on December 31, 2014 to the iTunes Store. The track features English musician and former member of The Beatles and Wings, Paul McCartney, and was the first of two rumored collaborations between the two artists, the other being a track called "Piss On Your Grave".[7] The song also features uncredited vocals by Ty Dolla $ign. West's wife Kim Kardashian tweeted upon the release of the track that it is her favorite track by West, saying, "People always ask me what my favorite Kanye song is and it's Only One. Kanye feels like his mom sang thru him to our daughter."[8] Kanye West is described in a press release as not being able to remember singing the words to "Only One" when he and McCartney were later reviewing the early 2014 sessions that generated the song. Later, West "realized that perhaps the words had never really come from him … he understood in that moment that his late mother, Dr. Donda West, who was also his mentor, confidante, and best friend, had spoken through him that day ... A message had been passed down through generations."[9] Kim also said, "I cry every time I hear this song. And such a beautiful photo of Kanye and North by Inez and Vinoodh."[10] In the song Kanye is singing from the perspective of his late mother Donda West who died in 2007. "Only One" was the first McCartney–West collaboration to be released commercially. The two would later feature on Rihanna's "FourFiveSeconds", released just twenty-four days after "Only One".
