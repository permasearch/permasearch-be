From the creation of the United States Army to 1821, non-commissioned officer (NCO) and staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) rank was distinguished by worsted epaulettes. Corporals wore one green epaulette on his left shoulder, sergeants wore one red epaulette on his right, while SNCOs (i.e., sergeants major quartermaster sergeants, drum majors, and fife majors) wore a red epaulette on each shoulder.[2] In 1780, the sergeant major insignia received a brass half-crescent placed on the skirt of the epaulette. From 1787-1821, NCO and SNCO rank was indicated by either white or yellow epaulettes (white for foot regiments and yellow for mounted regiments). Corporals wore one epaulette on the left shoulder, while sergeants wore one on the right. SNCOs wore an epaulette on both shoulders, with the sergeant major receiving either a nickel or brass (nickel with white and brass with yellow, again depending upon whether belonging to a foot or mounted regiment) full-crescent on the epaulette's skirt.
