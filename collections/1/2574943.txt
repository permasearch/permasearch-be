The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrastâ€”elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony.[29][30] The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.[1][7][19]
