In the first series, 24 contestants made it into the three semi-finals, and in subsequent series this has been increased to 40 (45 in series 6-10) contestants across five live shows. The act which receives the most public votes in each semi-final goes through to the final, with the second finalist being decided by the judges from the second and third most popular contestants. In series 6, a "wildcard" element was introduced. This is where judges pick an eliminated act from the semi-finals, and that act is sent through to the final. In series 6, the wildcard act selected was The Mend. In series 7, the wildcard was Steve Hewlett and in series 8,al Jon Clegg. Series 9 featured a second wildcard, voted for by the public from the five acts who lost the judges' vote in the semi-finals.[1] The judges' wildcard was Boyband and the public's wildcard was Jessie-Jane McParland.
