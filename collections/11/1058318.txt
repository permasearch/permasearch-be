Rugby Sevens, while still under the rugby union banner, does not use this system, and instead gives points for wins and draws. Sevens is a faster, more try-friendly game with a shorter time limit and a tendency to have runaway results. Sevens competitions are also usually one- or two-day affairs with an emphasis on the final bracket. All of this means there is little reason in using the Bonus Point System for the 7-a-side game.
