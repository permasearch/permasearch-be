One critical assessment contended that, apart from a few independent reviews, the HOS methodology generated little analysis except among consultants associated with the company.[35] That evaluation, conducted by a consultant for the United States Navy asserted that "the HOS literature tends to advertise their ideas and products more than making a contribution in substance to the field of Computer Science."[35] Edsgar Dijkstra described the USE.IT software as "mechanized aids for the application of obsolete techniques."[36] A detailed analysis of the HOS theory and AXES language was used by Harel to develop a derived language for a more modern form of structured programming derived from HOS called the And/Or programming language from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[37] Referring to Dijkstra's classic work on structured programming, Harel states: “As will become clear, the "layers" in which the program is arranged, these being in the heart of the idea of structured programming, correspond to the levels of the tree.” Harel goes on to show at that time how HOS and his derived And/Or programming language relates to mathematical logic, game theory and artificial intelligence. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers.[38] and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems[39]
