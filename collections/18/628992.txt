On July 20, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that formed over to the southwest of Midway Atoll, just to the west of the International Date Line.[42] The JTWC classified the system as subtropical, however.[43] By July 21, the subtropical storm started to show tropical characteristics, where it prompted both agencies to start issuing advisories, receiving the designation of 09W and the name Kulap.[44][42] During the next day, Kulap briefly reached its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) after imagery depicted some convection over near its compact center.[45] After moving westward in a marginally favorable environment, the JMA had reported a minimum pressure of 1002 hPa with peak 10-minute winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) during the early hours of July 24. However several hours later, Kulap had entered in a very unfavorable environment such as cooler waters of 25 °C (77 °F).[46] Due to strong shear and an interaction with Typhoon Noru to its south, Kulap had rapidly weakened; therefore, both agencies issued their final advisory on July 26.[47] The JMA, however, tracked Kulap's remnants until July 28 when it was absorbed by the outflow of Typhoon Noru.[42]
