There was an album. Terry: "A couple of weeks after we recorded the single, we went in and recorded an album which we never heard until about five years ago. We never heard it at that time and that was over forty years ago."[3] In fact, Chattahoochee released two further singles off The Murmaids album--"Heartbreak Ahead" and "Wild and Wonderful"--and subsequently used the Murmaids name for at least two singles which did not feature any of the three "Popsicles and Icicles" singers.  The vocalists on these latterday Murmaids singles have been identified as Cathy Brasher—a solo act on the Chattahoochee roster—and Yvonne Young.[8][9] Kim Fowley has said the Murmaids joined with Jackie DeShannon to form the Chattahoochee act the Lady-Bugs, whose cover of "How Do You Do It?", the Gerry and the Pacemakers'63 UK No. 1, lost out to the US re-release of the original in the summer of 1964.[10] However, Terry Fischer does not mention any involvement of any of the original Murmaids in that recording.
