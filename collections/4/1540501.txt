After the fall of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon X as the heir of Apocalypse, a new cadre of Horsemen was chosen, however the team was renamed as Ministers instead of Horsemen, with Azazel and the resurrected Emplate and the Summers brothers revealed to be among this group, Azazel as the Minister of Death,[15] Emplate as the Minister of Pestilence, Cyclops as the Minister of Famine and Havok as the Minister of War.[16] Each Minister has a special area of control and their own special troops.
