On April 9, James Earl Salisbury died of SARS at a hospital in Hong Kong. An American Mormon[10] and a teacher at Shenzhen Polytechnic,[11] he had been sick for approximately one month before his death,[12] but he was originally diagnosed with pneumonia.[13] His son Michael "Mickey" Salisbury was with him in China and also contracted the disease, but he survived it.[14] Salisbury's death led to more open admissions by the Chinese government about the spread of SARS.[15]
