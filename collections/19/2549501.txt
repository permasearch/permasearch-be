The next morning two of the friends, Kaylee (Brooke Butler) and Mitch (Mitchel Musso) wake up on the lifeguard shack. Kaylee's boyfriend, Jonah (Dean Geyer), awakens in a nearby convertible next to a girl named Chanda (Meagan Holder). In the back seat are Vance and his girlfriend, Ronnie (Cynthia Murell). Gilbert wakes up, stuck from the waist down in a trash barrel, having been put there as a prank after passing out. A girl named Marsha (Nikki Leigh) wakes up, topless, having fallen asleep on top of a picnic table. The rest of the teenagers, including Heather, are nowhere to be found; there are, instead, a bunch of empty sleeping bags in their places.
