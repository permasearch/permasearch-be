The British Olympic Synchronised Swimming team are in the local area to train, and Joyce has managed to persuade them to stay at the Solana. Hazel, the team's strict coach, is not impressed by the facilities, but agrees to Joyce's idea for a gala display in the hotel pool. Liam ends up escorting the girls on a tour along the coast - but was it actually a sightseeing trip? Madge is keen on Mohammed, the son of a wealthy property developer who knew Mel - but Mick and Janice are surprised when they find out that she wants to marry him. Back on the boat, Liam is unable to persuade the young swimmers to head back to the Solana. Do they mess up the gala performance?
