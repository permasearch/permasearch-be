In his 1821 play, Almansor, the German writer Heinrich Heine—referring to the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, during the Spanish Inquisition—wrote, "Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn human beings." ("Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.") Over a century later, Heine's own books were among the thousands of volumes that were torched by the Nazis in Berlin's Opernplatz, even while his poem Die Lorelei continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as "by an unknown author".[43] In Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the book deals with the concept of censorship by via burning books. It is said that Ray Bradbury wrote the book due to his concerns of literature being burned in America during the McCarthy era and as well, fearing that mass media would reduce the interest in reading books.[44]
