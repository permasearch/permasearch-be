The first episode of the season premiered in Los Angeles on September 23, 2015, with the season, consisting of 22 episodes, airing on ABC beginning on September 29, 2015 until May 17, 2016. The premiere was watched by 4.90 million viewers, higher than any episode of the entire second half of season two.[1] Overall, the season had generally consistent ratings, and received positive reviews; critics felt the series had 'hit its stride' with the season, and particularly praised the risky bottle episode "4,722 Hours", though the pacing of the season received criticism for trying to do too much at times. The series was renewed for a fourth season on March 3, 2016.[2]
