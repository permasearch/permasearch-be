The 2015–16 season saw Kevin McHale fired after a bad start where the team only won 4 of its first 11 games, and assistant J. B. Bickerstaff took over coaching duties.[131] Inconsistent play led to the Rockets struggling to remain in the playoff qualifying zone,[132] and surrounded by trade rumors.[133] Houston only clinched its 2016 playoffs spot by winning its last game, finishing the season 41–41 to earn an eight seed and a match-up against the Warriors.[134] Like in the previous year, the Rockets were once again defeated by Golden State in 5 games.[135]
