The commune of Cité Soleil in Port-au-Prince has been called "the most dangerous place on Earth" by the United Nations. It is one of the largest slums in the Northern Hemisphere.[156] Many of its residents are supporters of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,[157] who, according to the BBC, "accused the US of forcing him out – an accusation the US rejected as 'absurd'".[158]
