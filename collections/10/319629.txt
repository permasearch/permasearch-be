The poet Thomas Hoccleve, who may have met Chaucer and considered him his role model, hailed Chaucer as "the firste fyndere of our fair langage."[32] John Lydgate referred to Chaucer within his own text The Fall of Princes as the "lodesterre â€¦ off our language".[33] Around two centuries later, Sir Philip Sidney greatly praised Troilus and Criseyde in his own Defence of Poesie.[34]
