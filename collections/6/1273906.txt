Ernest Rutherford was Langsworthy Professor of Physics at the Victoria University of Manchester[8] (now the University of Manchester). He had already received numerous honors for his studies of radiation. He had discovered the existence of alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays, and had proved that these were the consequence of the disintegration of atoms. In 1906, he received a visit from a German physicist named Hans Geiger, and was so impressed that he asked Geiger to stay and help him with his research.[9] Ernest Marsden was a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger.
