Penny Fitzgerald (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a living peanut with antlers growing out of her head and, following the events of the episode "The Shell", Gumball's girlfriend. Their mutual affection and incapability of expressing their feelings for one another was a running theme in the series[13] until "The Shell", where Gumball finally directly reveals his feelings for her and they have their first kiss in the woods.[7] In the same episode, it is revealed that underneath Penny's shell lies a yellow, fairy-like inner alien self which shape-shifts based on her emotional state.[7] Penny's father Patrick, the head of a local construction company, is extremely overprotective of his daughter,[14] and does not trust Gumball until he saves her from getting run over by his own car in the episode "The Knights" and "The Shell" for helping his daughter through her emotions.[15] She is a member of the Elmore Junior High cheerleading and synchronized swimming teams.[14]
