The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places, and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 km/h (12 mph), diving up to 4.5 m (15 ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws.[23] To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support.[29] As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.[25]
