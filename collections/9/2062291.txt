Contrary to what others around her believed, Alisoun desired power through any various method available. Alisoun does not take men seriously. Alisoun only uses them for their money, belongings, and property; only considering them as sex objects in their own right.[12] When the Wife of Bath states, "but well I know, surely, God expressly instructed us to increase and multiply. I can well understand that noble text"[7] to bear fruit, not in children, but financially through marriage, land, and from inheritance when her husband's pass;[13] Alisoun chose to interpret the meaning of the statement by clarifying that she has no interest in childbearing as a means of showing fruitfulness, but the progression of her financial stability is her ideal way of proving success.
