The trial stage occurs at the beginning of an intercultural relationship when partners are beginning to explore their cultural differences. During this stage, each partner is attempting to determine what cultural identities they want for the relationship.

During this stage, individuals are more willing to risk face threats to establish a balance necessary for the relationship.
