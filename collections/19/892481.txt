Taylor matched John Lowe`s record by making 28 consecutive appearances at the World Championship in the 2017 edition. He didn't drop a set in matches against David Platt and Kevin Painter and had a three sets to nil lead against Kim Huybrechts in their third round match. Huybrechts took two consecutive sets, but missed darts to force a decider and Taylor hit double seven to set up a quarter-final match against Raymond van Barneveld.[193] In a rematch of the final ten years prior, Taylor recovered from a 3â€“1 deficit but lost the next two sets and, consequently, the match.[194] Taylor was sixth in the world rankings after the event and he stated his intention to cut back on non-televised appearances in the 2017 season.[195]
