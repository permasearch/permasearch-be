Caffuzzi was appointed acting pastor on June 24.[1] The congregation increased rapidly.[1] By the end of 1907, the congregation had swelled from its 150 figure in 1906 to 1,134 adults and 150 children by the end of 1907, and 2,500 adults in 1914.[1] By 1914, the Sunday school had an attendance of 800 children.[1]
