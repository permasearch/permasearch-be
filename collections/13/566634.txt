Through improvisation, Motor Trend developed a way to neutral-drop launch the LFA. Lexus LFA had the heavy advantage in the test was over 140 kg (300 lb) lighter than the Nissan GT-R while putting down 60 wheel horsepower more when they strapped both cars to a Mustang dyno in this test while Nissan GT-R came with stickier high-grip tires and also offered a launch control with AWD. However, this flawed method that did not control traction through alteration of ignition timing and stability control like a launch control system does, it was the best method they had available, which resulted in a 3.8 seconds 0−60 mph (versus 3.5 seconds for the Nissan GT-R). However, Lexus LFA achieved 0−100 mph 0.4 seconds quicker and by quarter-mile mark, LFA was travelling 4 mph faster at the ​1⁄4 mile trap with a time of 11.8 seconds (versus 11.9 for Nissan GT-R).
