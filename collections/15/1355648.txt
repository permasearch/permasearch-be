Rangel supported legalization of the numbers game, saying "For the average Harlemite, playing numbers ... is moral and a way of life."[11] He also opposed harsher penalties on prostitutes, on grounds of ineffectiveness.[11] He was strongly concerned by the effects of drugs on Harlem, advocated that drug pushers be held accountable for the crimes committed by their users, and in general believed the problem was at the level of a threat to national security.[45][46]
