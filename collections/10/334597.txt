The 29th Division attacked towards Beaumont-Hamel. Part of the attack was filmed and showed the detonation of a 40,000 lb (18,000 kg) mine beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt at 7:20 a.m., ten minutes before the infantry attack began.[86] The detonation of the mine alerted the Germans and British troops failed to occupy all of the mine crater, before German troops arrived and took over the far lip. Many troops of both brigades were shot down in no man's land, which was dominated by Redan Ridge and then caught by German artillery barrages. German white signal rockets were seen and taken for British success flares, which led the divisional commander Major-General de Lisle to order the 88th Brigade from reserve, to exploit the success. The brigade included the Newfoundland Regiment, which advanced on open ground from reserve trenches 200 yd (180 m) back from the British front line.[87]
