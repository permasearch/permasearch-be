After a 10-year hiatus, America built another production automobile equipped with disc brakes - the 1963 Studebaker Avanti[13] (the Bendix system was optional on some of the other Studebaker models[14]). Front disc brakes became standard equipment in 1965 on the Rambler Marlin[15] (the Bendix units were optional on all American Motors' Rambler Classic and Ambassador models[16]), as well as on the Ford Thunderbird,[17] and the Lincoln Continental.[18] A four-wheel disc brake system was also introduced in 1965 on the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.[19]
