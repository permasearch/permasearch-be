Diagonalizable matrices and maps are of interest because diagonal matrices are especially easy to handle: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known, one can raise a diagonal matrix to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that same power, and the determinant of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries. Geometrically, a diagonalizable matrix is an inhomogeneous dilation (or anisotropic scaling) — it scales the space, as does a homogeneous dilation, but by a different factor in each direction, determined by the scale factors on each axis (diagonal entries).
