The modern English word hour is a development of the Anglo-Norman houre and Middle English ure, first attested in the 13th century.[2][b] It displaced the Old English "tide" (Old English: tīd, "time")[4] and "stound" (stund, "span of time").[5] The Anglo-Norman term was a borrowing of Old French ure, a variant of ore, which derived from Latin hōra and Greek hṓrā (ὥρα). Like Old English tīd and stund, hṓrā was originally a vaguer word for any span of time, including seasons and years. Its Proto-Indo-European root has been reconstructed as *yeh₁- ("year, summer"), making hour distantly cognate with year.
