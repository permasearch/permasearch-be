Australian batsman hold two Test wicket partnerships records. Sid Barnes and Don Bradman came together in the second Test of the 1946â€“47 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground and put together a fifth wicket partnership of 405 runs. The other record is the fourth wicket partnership of 449 which was set by still active Shaun Marsh and the recently retired Adam Voges. This came in the first Test against the West Indies at Bellerive Oval in December 2015.[12]
