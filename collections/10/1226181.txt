In August 1981, Mikkos Cassadine appears on his private island in Greece with several of his business associates, including his brothers, Victor and Tony.[10] Mikkos presents his plan to use the world's largest uncut diamond, the Ice Princess to power his weather machine and force the entire world to bend to his will, and allow him to rebuild the world in his own pure, perfect image. The first step of Mikkos's plan is to freeze the world, starting with Port Charles, New York; the hometown of Luke and Laura Spencer. By freezing Port Charles, Mikkos could bring the world to its knees and force its leaders to do his bidding. Mikkos refuses to negotiate with the World Security Bureau (WSB) and lowers the temperature in Port Charles so low that it is declared as disaster area.[10] However, the machine malfunctions killing Tony and Alexandria Quartermaine along with others. However Mikkos remains. Luke, Laura and WSB agent, Robert Scorpio break into the Cassadine compound, to stop Mikkos; during a struggle with Luke, Mikkos is frozen to death after falling into his own ice chamber. Luke is able to shut down the machine and Port Charles is safe; Victor is sent to prison. However, Mikkos's murder at the hands of the Spencer clan would affect the show for years to come.[10]
