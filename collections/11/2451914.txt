Courtney Portnoy (voiced by Sharon Horgan) is a human tongue-twisting celebrity actress and one of Princess Carolyn's managerial clients, though she is also represented by Rutabaga Rabitowitz.  She gets set up in a fake relationship with Todd. She is shown to be highly superficial and materialistic. She starred in the movie "Ms. Taken", an inter-universe spin-off of the Liam Neeson "Taken" movie series, but the film was abandoned by the studio following a series of highly-publicized mass shooting incidents. After a series of mishaps with her career including Todd calling off the fake engagement and "Ms. Taken" getting pulled, she fires Princess Carolyn.
