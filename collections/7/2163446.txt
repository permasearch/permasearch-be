This song is considered 'dark' in tone, and is comparable to Collins' earlier hit single "In the Air Tonight", as both contain powerful drum kit along with simplistic Synthesizers and guitar riffs, coupled with angry lyrics directed at Collins' failed first marriage.[1] The drums also illustrate the gated reverb recording technique that defined Collins' sound throughout the 1980s. During "I Don't Care Anymore", the drum track switches several times between "standard" studio sound and a gated reverb overlay. The song earned Collins his first Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1984, but lost to Michael Jackson's "Beat It".[2]
