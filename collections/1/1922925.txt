Arpaio's jail detention practices included serving inmates edibles recovered from food rescue[29] and limiting meals to twice daily.[30] He also banned inmates from possessing "sexually explicit material" including Playboy magazine, after female officers complained that inmates openly masturbated while viewing the articles. The ban was challenged on First Amendment grounds, but was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[31] In February 2007, Arpaio instituted an in-house radio station he called KJOE,[32] broadcasting classical music, opera, Frank Sinatra hits, patriotic music, and educational programming five days a week, four hours each day.
