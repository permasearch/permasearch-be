Their relationship continued to be frosty as Strachan moved into management himself.[203] In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson stated that Strachan "could not be trusted an inch â€“ I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry".[203] Strachan's reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, My Life in Football, was one of being "surprised and disappointed", although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan's Coventry City in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County.[203] By 2006 they appeared to have "declared something of a truce",[203] ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan's Celtic.[205]
