The Church does not approve of the use of abortion as a means of birth control or family planning, but recognizes a woman's right to receive one. Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's physical or mental health is at risk.[131] The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions.[132]
