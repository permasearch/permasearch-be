In the final episode, as a nod to St. Elsewhereâ€™s finale, "The Last One" (complete with a replica of the series' namesake building in a snow-globe stared at by a mentally challenged male), Liz's life serves as the inspiration for a sitcom that is pitched by her great-granddaughter 100 years in the future. The series is green-lighted by immortal NBC president Kenneth Parcell ("Last Lunch") -- even though the series includes every one of the banned features on the list which Kenneth gave to Liz when beginning his tenure in "Hogcock!".
