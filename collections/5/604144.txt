On September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of Trevor Noah's tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart's set.[35] A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped.[36] On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote The Daily Show's RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions' respective cities).[37] The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show that Washington is "a little broke" and needs "repair".[38] Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.
