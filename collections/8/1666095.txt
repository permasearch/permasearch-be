He also watches as the kidnappers board Enterprise, and how, in order to save Archer's life, Commander Tucker overloads two conduits and dies after becoming mortally wounded. He notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now sure of what course he should take.[1] The final shot of the episode is a montage of the ships named Enterprise as Captains Picard, Kirk, and Archer recite the "Where no man has gone before" monologue.
