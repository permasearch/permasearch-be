Lyrically, "Nobody's Fault but Mine" has been called "Led Zeppelin's 'Hell Hound on My Trail'".[1] Robert Johnson's 1937 Delta blues song tells of a man trying to stay ahead of the evil which is pursuing him, but it does not address the cause or lasting solution for his predicament. In Blind Willie Johnson's "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", the problem is clearly stated: he will be doomed, unless he uses his abilities to learn (and presumably live according to) biblical teachings. Led Zeppelin retain Blind Willie's admission that he ultimately is to blame, but add Robert Johnson's sense of despair. However, they shift the focus from religion to one "relevant to the Zeppelin lifestyle of the day".[2] Their lyrics include "that monkey on my back", a commonly used reference to addiction, and "the devil he told me to roll, how to roll the line tonight";[7] to overcome, Plant concludes "gonna change my ways tonight". "For Robert [Plant] and perhaps the others, it was a sort of exorcism".[1]
