Seasonal wind shifts lead to long-lasting wet seasons which produce the bulk of annual precipitation in areas such as Southeast Asia, Australia, Western Africa, eastern South America, Mexico, and the Philippines. Widespread flooding occurs if rainfall is excessive,[64] which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas.[65] Floods cause rivers to exceed their capacity with nearby buildings becoming submerged.[66] Flooding may be exacerbated if there are fires during the previous dry season. This may cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic and repel water.[67]
