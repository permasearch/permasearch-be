Cortana is an artificial intelligence constructed from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, the creator of the SPARTAN supersoldier project; Halsey's synaptic networks became the basis for Cortana's processors.[1] Cortana is classified as a "smart" AI, meaning that her creative matrix is allowed to expand, in contrast to the limited matrix of other "dumb" AI characters in the stories.[1] Cortana and other AIs are subject to a seven-year lifespan, after which they begin to dissemble and think themselves to death in a process known as rampancy.[2][3]
