If the refinanced loan has the same interest rate as previously, but a longer term, it will result in a larger total interest cost over the life of the loan, and will result in the borrower remaining in debt for many more years.  Typically, a refinanced loan will have a lower interest rate.  This lower rate, combined with the new, longer term remaining on the loan will lower payments.
