Originally described by Kaplan (1957)[28] is often known by its acronym SCUD. This disease is known to be caused by a variety of bacteria entering through some sort of abrasion, combined with poor animal husbandry. The disease is identified by its progression and what starts as ulcerative lesions of the plastron leads to a septacemic infection causing the degradation of the liver and other organs.[29] Without treatment, this will lead to death.
