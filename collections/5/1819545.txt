Asian Americans are Americans of Asian descent. The term refers to a panethnic group that includes diverse populations, which have ancestral origins in East Asia, Southeast Asia, or South Asia, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.[6] This includes people who indicate their race(s) on the census as "Asian" or reported entries such as "Asian Indian, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Pakistani, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other Asian".[7] Asian Americans with no other ancestry comprise 5.4% of the U.S. population, while people who are Asian alone, and those combined with at least one other race, make up 6.5%.[1][2]
