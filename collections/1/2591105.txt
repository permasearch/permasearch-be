Uzbekistan also maintains the world's second-highest rate of modern slavery, 3.97%[55] of the country's population working as modern slaves. In real terms, this means that there are 1.2 million modern slaves[55] in Uzbekistan. Most work in the cotton industry. The government allegedly forces state employees to pick cotton in the fall months.[56] World Bank loans have been connected to projects that use child labour and forced labour practices in the cotton industry.[57]
