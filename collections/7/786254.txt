Elise and Tucker proceed to the basement to look for the ghost and search for the red door to enter The Further and rescue Melissa. Meanwhile, Imogen and Specs try to find a Bible that Garza held dear, as Elise believes it can help them. While in the basement, Elise sees something in the exhaust vent of the plumbing systems and finds a night gown that belonged to the female ghost, revealing her name to be Anna. A flashback reveals that the day Elise saw Anna in the laundry room she was actually alive and had escaped from the cellar room where Gerald kept her, similar to Garza. When Gerald walks in the laundry room he did see Anna, but pretended that there was nothing there. Elise also sees that after she ran away, her father brutally kills Anna. Entering the vents, Elise discovers several suitcases filled with human remains of the various women that have been abducted by the men of the house. As Elise examines a suitcase, she is ambushed by Key Face who takes her into The Further and leaves Elise's unconscious body in the real world.
