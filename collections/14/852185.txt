The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas. During 2014, there were approximately 68,000 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.[80] During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.[81] The figure was 280,873 in 2010,[82] 201,053 in 2009 and 126,633 in 2008.[83]
