Governors-General served at the pleasure of the sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. Governors-General could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional governor-general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first Governor-General of British India was Warren Hastings, and the first Governor-General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten.
