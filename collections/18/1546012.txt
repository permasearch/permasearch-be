A series of studies conducted within the last decade found similar results in students studying abroad in Spain for a short-term and/or semester long program. These studies found that students can improve their speaking proficiency during one semester, there is a positive relationship between students’ integrative motivation and interaction with second language culture, and student contact with the Spanish language has a great effect on their speaking improvement.[7] We especially see these results in students who live with host families during their program. Anne Reynolds-Case found improvements in understanding and usage of the vosotros form after studying in Spain.[8] One study specifically studies culture perceptions of students studying abroad in Spain. Alan Meredith defines culture as consisting “of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts.” Questionnaires were given to students living with host families during a two-month program in Spain. He studies how these groups perceive customs, such as concern for personal appearance, physical contact, cooking styles, politics, etc. The study found a variety of results depending the cultural custom. However, the American students’ perceptions most closely aligned with the Young Spaniards (16-22 years old).[9] At the same time, Angela George’s study found little significance in the adoption of regional features during their semester abroad.[10] Though most of these studies focused on students who came from America to study in Spain, the United States is not the only one sending their students. Brian Denman’s article demonstrates an increase of Saudi student mobility for education, including locations such as Spain.[11]
