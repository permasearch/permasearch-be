United Russia has come in for criticism that it is "the party of crooks and thieves" (партия жуликов и воров, a term coined by activist Alexey Navalny)[74] due to the continuing prevalence of corruption in Russia.[75] In October 2011, Novaya Gazeta published an article describing how members of the public were writing the slogan on banknotes in protest.[76] In December 2011, Putin rejected the accusation of corruption, saying that it was a general problem that was not restricted to one particular party: "They say that the ruling party is associated with theft, with corruption, but it's a cliché related not to a certain political force, it's a cliché related to power [...] What's important, however, is how the ruling government is fighting these negative things".[75]
