The 2011 Tucson offered in the U.S. a new GL trim which replaces the 2010 GLS model as Tucson's base trim. The GL is powered by a new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to either a five-speed manual or an available six-speed automatic transmission in order to obtain better fuel economy than the 2.4-liter engine. The 2011 GLS trim includes the features of the 2010 "Popular Equipment Package" and an automatic transmission as standard equipment. Limited models now include standard electrochromatic mirrors with Homelink and has received Sachs dampeners to provide a smoother ride. The electronic stability control and motor driven power steering systems have been enhanced for improved performance.  All AWD models now receive standard heated seats. This model was a prominent vehicle used by the survivors in The Walking Dead (TV series).
