There are many results on the error rate of the k nearest neighbour classifiers.[14] The k-nearest neighbour classifier is strongly (that is for any joint distribution on     ( X , Y )   {\displaystyle (X,Y)}  ) consistent provided     k :=  k  n     {\displaystyle k:=k_{n}}   diverges and      k  n    /  n   {\displaystyle k_{n}/n}   converges to zero as     n → ∞   {\displaystyle n\to \infty }  .
