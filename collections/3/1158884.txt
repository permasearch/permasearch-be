On June 26, CNN reported that satellite images from June 2018 show that North Korea was making numerous improvements to the infrastructure at a nuclear research facility.[203] However, the media source 38 North, an American agency which monitors North Korea, told CNN that only two small roof buildings had been newly erected, which might be used for hospitality roles for senior officials or nuclear inspectors. Other improved infrastructures were already developed before the Trump-Kim Summit.[204][205] On June 30, NBC reported that, according to an assessment by the U.S. intelligence agencies, North Korea might have increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons at multiple secret sites after the summit, though if the process of enrichment had occurred, it must have begun before the summit.[206][207] On August 3, experts monitoring U.N. sanctions against North Korea sent a report to the UN Security Council saying North Korea "has not stopped its nuclear and missiles programs" and is still violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.[208][209] US requested China and Russia about further sanctions on North Korea. However China disagrees with the request, and Russia raised uncertainties about the accusations by the council. China and Russia beckoned on UN council to consider relaxing sanctions to compensate North Korea for opening up the discussion with the US as  North Korea's halting missile tests and demonstrating their shared interest in the region.
