When specifying wiring sizes in a three-phase system, we only need to know the magnitude of the phase and neutral currents. The neutral current can be determined by adding the three phase currents together as complex numbers and then converting from rectangular to polar co-ordinates. If the three-phase root mean square (RMS) currents are      I  L 1     {\displaystyle I_{L1}}  ,      I  L 2     {\displaystyle I_{L2}}  , and      I  L 3     {\displaystyle I_{L3}}  , the neutral RMS current is:
