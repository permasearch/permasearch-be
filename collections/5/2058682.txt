This building dates from the 15th century and houses a pair of shops. It was originally built at Horsham, Sussex. The three-storey building has jettied upper floors. It is timber-framed with a peg tile roof and peg tiles to the upper floors on at least one side. The upper floors serve as the Museum's library and are not normally open to the public.[34]
