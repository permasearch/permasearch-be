In August 2010 PepsiCo replaced the original Sierra Mist formula with Sierra Mist Natural,[14] which is sweetened with sucrose (table sugar) instead of high fructose corn syrup. The new formulation contains four other ingredients: carbonated water, citric acid, natural flavor, potassium citrate, and a preservative.[21]
