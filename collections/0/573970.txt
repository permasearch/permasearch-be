McDonald's locations in South Korea serve a shrimp burger as well as a Bulgogi Burger, a pork patty in bulgogi marinade. The bulgogi-flavored sauce was developed by Ottogi, a large South Korean food manufacturer that provides all of the condiments to the country's McDonald's.[43] A 24-hour McDelivery service was launched in 2007 and now is available across South Korea.[44]  McDelivery also has an app available on both Google Play and the Apple Store.[45][46]
