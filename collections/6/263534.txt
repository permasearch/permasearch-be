After his brief stint in Portland, he was traded back to San Antonio, along with Erick Barkley and a 2003 2nd-round pick, in exchange for Charles Smith, Amal McCaskill, and Antonio Daniels on August 2, 2002. He supported the Spurs from the bench in nearly every game (75) the following year, in what would be his final season in the league.[19] In Game 6 of the 2003 Western Conference Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr made four second-half three-pointers that helped eliminate Dallas. The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the New Jersey Nets in the 2003 NBA Finals, 4â€“2.
