In 2006, GN Netcom consolidated its Contact Center and Office (CC&O) headset division under the Jabra brand. This was followed by a restructuring in 2008, which established two distinct divisions within Jabra; CC&O and Mobile. This restructuring thus facilitated a greater focus on business-to-business and consumer markets respectively.[4][5]
