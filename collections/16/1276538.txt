The city of Starkville and the Mississippi State campus have been a tour stop for many artists such as 2 chainz, Bon Jovi, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan[31] and most famously for Johnny Cash in 1965. After Johnny Cash's performance he was arrested, which led him to write the song "Starkville City Jail".[32]
