The PRC and ROC governments claim that during negotiations with China over the Ryukyu Islands after the First Sino-Japanese War, the islands were not mentioned at all in a partition plan suggested by US ex-President Ulysses S. Grant.[54] The lease of the islands in 1896 and subsequent purchase in 1930 by the Koga family[54] were merely domestic arrangements made by the Japanese government which had no bearing on the legal status of the islands.
