The maritime application of CAMM is known as Sea Ceptor.[23] The system will provide the principal air defence capability for the Royal Navyâ€™s Type 23 and Type 26 Frigates, as well as arming other navies around the world. Sea Ceptor can be easily retrofitted onto a wide range of platforms, from 50m OPVs to frigates and destroyers.
