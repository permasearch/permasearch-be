Kendall makes his first on-screen appearance in "Stress Relief", and appears again in "Company Picnic," in which he and Toby talk about past Human Resources stories, showing a similar personality to Toby. Since he was the corporate HR representative, it is presumed that he lost his job or was transferred out of New York to a new Sabre branch that needed its own HR person on hand.
