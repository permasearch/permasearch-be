Ives opposed HB 2675, the law provides that each class or course in comprehensive sex education offered in any grades 6 through 12 should include instruction on both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. It also makes changes to provide for all public schools that teach sex education in grades 6 through 12 shall emphasize that abstinence from sexual intercourse is a responsible and positive decision. Schools are no longer required to emphasize that abstinence is the “expected norm.”[26]
