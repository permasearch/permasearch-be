Williams felt secure he would not run out of ideas as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.[43] He also explained that he often used free association of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.[49] He noted that the competitive comedy club atmosphere could cause problems. For example, some comedians accused him of intentionally copying their jokes, although Williams strongly denied ever doing so.[43] Whoopi Goldberg defended him, explaining that it is difficult for comedians not to pick up and reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done "all the time."[50] He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.[50]
