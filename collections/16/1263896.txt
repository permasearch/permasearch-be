On September 3, 2008, the band played a concert in Minneapolis at the Target Center, on the second day of the Republican National Convention. The band surprised the crowd when they silently stood on stage while wearing orange Guantanamo Bay-like prisoner suits with black hoods over their heads. They opened up with "Bombtrack."[28] An impromptu demonstration spilled out into the streets afterwards. 102 people were arrested as riot police ended the gathering.[29]
