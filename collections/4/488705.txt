Lee hoped Hunter would get a love interest at some point during his tenure, commenting "everyone wants a girlfriend!"[2] In August 2015, Daniel Van Boom of the Daily Mail Australia published photos showing Lee filming a romantic moment between his character and Olivia Fraser Richards played by Raechelle Banno.[16] Hunter befriends Olivia following her return to the Bay two months later.[17] While they are spending time together at the beach pool, Olivia asks Hunter not to look at her when she gets out of the water. However, Hunter "can't resist a peek" and is shocked when he notices Olivia's thighs are covered in scars.[17] Hunter realises that Olivia is hiding something, and he later tells VJ about the scars, as he feels that he cannot talk to Olivia about it.[17] VJ, who is competing with Hunter for Olivia's affections, takes the opportunity to tell Olivia that Hunter saw her scars and says he will be there for her.[17] Olivia helps Hunter to deal with his mother's death and bond with his new family.[8] Their relationship is tested by Hunter's failure to plan for the future,[8] and the arrival of Lindsay Ford (Georgia Flood), who wants Hunter for herself.[18]
