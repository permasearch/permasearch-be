A raised beach, marine terrace, coastal terrace,[1] or perched coastline is a relatively flat, horizontal or gently inclined surface of marine origin,[2] mostly an old abrasion platform which has been lifted out of the sphere of wave activity (sometimes called "tread"). Thus, it lies above or under the current sea level, depending on the time of its formation.[3][4] It is bounded by a steeper ascending slope on the landward side and a steeper descending slope on the seaward side[2] (sometimes called "riser"). Due to its generally flat shape it is often used for anthropogenic structures such as settlements and infrastructure.[3]
