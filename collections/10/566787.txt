"Got to Get You into My Life" is a song by the Beatles, first released in 1966 on the album Revolver. It was written by Paul McCartney, though officially credited to Lennonâ€“McCartney.[3][4] The song is a homage to the Motown Sound, with colourful brass instrumentation,[5] and lyrics that suggest a psychedelic experience.[2] "It's actually an ode to pot," McCartney explained. A cover version by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers peaked at number six in 1966 in the UK.[6] The song was issued in the United States as a single from the Rock 'n' Roll Music compilation album in 1976, six years after the Beatles disbanded. It reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,[7] the Beatles' last top ten US hit until their 1995 release "Free as a Bird".
