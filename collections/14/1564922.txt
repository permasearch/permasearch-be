They recorded a second album, Happy Birthday Ruthy Baby, with McGuinness Flint—again writing most of the songs—before leaving to form the duo Gallagher and Lyle in 1972, signing to A&M Records after their initial solo album was first released on UK and US Capitol**. They recorded four albums: Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, Willie and the Lapdog, Seeds and The Last Cowboy, again under the auspices of Glyn Johns. But it was not until they teamed up with US producer David Kershenbaum for their fifth album Breakaway, in 1976, that they charted again, with the hits "Heart on My Sleeve" and "I Wanna Stay with You", both of which reached Number 6 in the UK Singles Chart and also charted in the US.[2]
