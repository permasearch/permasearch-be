Riesling is produced predominantly in Martinborough and south. The same may be said with less forcefulness about GewÃ¼rztraminer (which is also planted extensively in Gisborne). Pinot gris is being planted increasingly, especially in Martinborough and the South Island. Chenin blanc was once more important, but the viticultural peculiarities of the variety, particularly its unpredictable cropping in New Zealand, have led to its disfavor. Milton Estate in Gisborne produces an example of this variety.
