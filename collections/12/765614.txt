The Hells Angels' official website attributes the official "death's head" insignia design to Frank Sadilek, past president of the San Francisco chapter.[31] The colors and shape of the early-style jacket emblem (prior to 1953) were copied from the insignias of the 85th Fighter Squadron and the 552nd Medium Bomber Squadron.[31]
