In 'The Inbetweeners Movie', Jay is the force behind the idea that the boys should go out, drink and sleep with random girls; however, he ends up falling for a girl named Jane who, despite being overweight, is easy-going and funny. He initially insults her and implies he is embarrassed by her weight, to which she writes him off, but they reconcile when he realises his pre-conceived ideas about girls aren't quite right and that he really likes Jane. Despite his series-long judgemental nature about girls' appearances, he appears to have overcome it when Neil makes a careless remark about her weight, and he replies with "What a horrible thing to say". She gives him his first ever blowjob and they immediately become a couple.
