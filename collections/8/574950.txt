In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase rule of thumb,[7] which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin.[3] Patricia T. O'Conner, former editor of the New York Times Book Review, described it as "one of the most persistent myths of political correctness".[5] During the 1990s, several authors, including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers, wrote about the false etymology of rule of thumb.[3] Sommers analyzed the history of the phrase and its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.[11] Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.[3]
