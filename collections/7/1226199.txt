In 1988 Sean started to suffer from a mid-life crisis. During this time he fell for Dr. Greta Ingstrom, but her husband resurfaced. Sean went back to his past love Tiffany, who was unhappy with his wandering ways. Sean and Tiffany were able to work out their differences. The two were married in the Quartermaine mansion amongst friends and family. After the wedding, Sean assists his friend Felicia Jones in tracking down her husband Frisco's grave after she was informed he had been killed. Sean's insidious past came back to bite him in the form of his nemesis Cesar Faison who arrived in Port Charles in 1990. Through flashbacks, it was revealed the two had plotted to destroy Robert and Anna's marriage back their WSB days. Back when Sean was head of the WSB, he helped Cesar fake his death. Then one of the heads of rival spy agency, the DVX, helped to break the Scorpios apart, with Robert staying with the WSB and Anna going to work for DVX. Robert and Anna found out the truth. Nevertheless, Sean still helped his friends defeat Faison, before he could force Anna into marrying him. Cesar took his revenge on Sean in 1991, when he poisoned Sean's wife Tiffany with a mysterious illness that left her comatose. Cesar held the only cure and used this as leverage to make Sean do his bidding, though at the time Sean did not realize Cesar was behind Tiffany's illness. When Sean found out Cesar was behind everything, he once again teamed up with Robert and Anna to bring him down.
