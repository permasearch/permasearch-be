Max Weber famously argued that the state is that which controls the monopoly on the legitimate use of force.[111][112] The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term failed state refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.[113]
