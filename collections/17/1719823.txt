On February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims.[47] With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only get into cars with University stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at UCSC.[20] He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen "Allison" Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which reassured Liu to also enter.[43] He then fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with his .22 caliber pistol and wrapped their bodies in blankets.[47]
