The Ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon. The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface, returning those images until they were destroyed upon impact. A series of mishaps, however, led to the failure of the first five flights. At one point, the program was called "shoot and hope".[6] Congress launched an investigation into “problems of management” at NASA Headquarters and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[7] After reorganizing the organization twice, Ranger 7 successfully returned images in July 1964, followed by two more successful missions.
