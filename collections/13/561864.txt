Bacteria that ferment any of the three sugars in the medium will produce byproducts.[3] These byproducts are usually acids, which will change the color of the red pH-sensitive dye (phenol red) to a yellow color. Position of the color change distinguishes the acid production associated with glucose fermentation from the acidic byproducts of lactose or sucrose fermentation. Many bacteria that can ferment sugars in the anaerobic butt of the tube are enterobacteria.
