Bail proceedings: accused can decline to answer incriminating questions: note that court has duty to inform accused of this right: s 60 (11B)(c) of CPA. What is the position if accused is not expressly informed of this right, and incriminates himself during bail proceedings? Best view appears to be that such evidence would not be automatically excluded: Du Toit et al: commentary on s 60 (11B)(c): Why exclude if it is clear that accused understood the position perfectly? Makes sense especially in the case of accuseds who already know of this right, or are well versed in the law.
