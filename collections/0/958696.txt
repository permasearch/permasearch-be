The series has sometimes drawn criticism for narrowness in the musical genres it includes—described as focused on "hipster-infused indie rock" by Zachary Crockett at Vox[2]—to the exclusion of genres like country and hip-hop.[3] However reviewers also say the series' musical focus has broadened in scope over time.[2][4] As of July 2017, R&B singer T-Pain's appearance on the series is Tiny Desk Concerts' most popular video with 10.7 million times (Anderson Paak's appearance is the second-most viewed, seen 8.4 million times).[2]
