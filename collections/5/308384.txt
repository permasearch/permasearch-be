In the 1650s, individual Quaker women prophesied and preached publicly, developing charismatic personas and spreading the sect. This practice was bolstered by the movement's firm concept of spiritual equality for men and women.[57] Moreover, Quakerism initially was propelled by the non-conformist behaviours of its followers, especially women who broke from social norms.[58] By the 1660s, the progress of the movement resulted in more structured organisation, which led to separate women's meetings.[59] Through the women's meeting, women oversaw domestic and community life, including marriage.[30] From the beginning, Quaker women, most notably Margaret Fell, played an important role in defining Quakerism.[60][61] Others active in proselytising included Mary Penington, Mary Mollineux and Barbara Blaugdone.[62] Quaker women even published at least 220 texts during the seventeenth century.[63] However, within the Quaker movement, some resented the power of women within the community. In the early years of Quakerism, George Fox faced resistance in developing and establishing women's meetings. As controversy increased, Fox did not fully adhere to this agenda; For example, he established the London Six Weeks Meeting in 1671, as a regulatory body, led by thirty-five women and forty-nine men.[64] Regardless, conflict culminated in the Wilkinson–Story split, in which a portion of the Quaker community left to worship independently in protest of women's meetings.[65] After several years, the schism became largely resolved, testifying to the resistance of some within the Quaker community, and to the radical spiritual role of women that George Fox and Margaret Fell had encouraged. Also particularly within the relatively prosperous Quaker communities of the eastern United States, the focus on the child and "holy conversation" gave women unusual community power, although they were largely excluded from the market economy. With the Hicksite–Orthodox split of 1827–1828, Orthodox women found their spiritual role decreased, while Hicksite women retained greater influence.
