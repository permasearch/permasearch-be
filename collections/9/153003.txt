The system was adopted by Arabic mathematicians in Baghdad and passed on to the Arabs farther west. There is some evidence to suggest that the numerals in their current form developed from Arabic letters in the Tamazgha, the western region of the Arab world.[4] The current form of the numerals developed by the Berbers in North Africa, distinct in form from the Indian and Eastern Arabic numerals. It was in the North African Berber city of Bejaia that the Italian scholar Fibonacci first encountered the numerals; his work was crucial in making them known throughout Europe and then further to the Europeans who spread it worldwide. The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade, books and colonialism.
