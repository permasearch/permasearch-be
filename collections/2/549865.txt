The freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug is also questioned, recognizing that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature[153] and that addictions in and of themselves curb individual freedom. Likewise, the proposal that addictive drugs should be legalized, regulated and opened to "free market dynamics" is immediately belied by the recognition that the drug market for an addict is no longer a free market â€“ it is clear that they will pay any price when needing their drug.[1]
