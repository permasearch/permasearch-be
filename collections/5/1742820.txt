At its launch, the Fusion was available in S, SE, and SEL trims. The base engine was the 160 hp (119 kW) Mazda-designed 2.3 L Duratec 23 I4, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. SE and SEL models were available with a 221 hp (165 kW) 3.0 L Duratec 30 V6 and a 6-speed automatic.[7] The Fusion shares some interior parts with the otherwise unrelated Mk III Ford Mondeo, such as part of the console and the seats. Both automatic and manual transmissions are available (the latter only with the I4 engine).
