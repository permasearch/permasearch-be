Hamilton's most controversial proposal was the establishment of a National Bank in Hamilton's Report on a National Bank, debated by the Second Congress, that assembled December 6, 1790.[192] Hamilton proposed Congress to charter a national bank capitalized at $10 million, one-fifth provided by the federal government, and the rest by individual investors, whose main purpose was to assist the nation's financial operations.[192] Although Madison and Jefferson objected, the bank easily passed Congress and the law was presented to Washington for signing on February 14, 1791.[192] Washington asked for advise from his cabinet, Jefferson and Randoph strongly opposed the new bank constitutionally, while Hamilton supported the bank, believing it would legally be operated on the government's enumerated powers.[192] Washington sided with Hamilton and signed the legislation on February 25, however, the rift between Hamilton and Jefferson widened and became openly hostile.[192] Historians believe that the Hamilton-Jefferson rift was a manifistation of divisions between the North and South over slavery.[192]
