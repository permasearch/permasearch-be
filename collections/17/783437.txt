In Mexico, caguama and ballena are popular names for a 940 ml (33.1 imp fl oz; 31.8 U.S. fl oz) beer bottle. The Mexican beer brands which are sold in these bottles include Tecate, Carta Blanca, Sol, Indio, Victoria, Corona Familiar and Pacífico. The name "caguama" refers to the Loggerhead sea turtle, which is called "caguama" in Spanish.[25] There are larger sizes of beer bottle called a super caguama or a caguamon. The ballena is Spanish for whale.
