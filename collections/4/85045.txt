In 2014, Twenty One Pilots played a number of music festivals and other events around the United States, such as Lollapalooza,[57] Bonnaroo,[58] Boston Calling, and Firefly.[59] Requests from many of these cities were incorporated into the band's first headlining tour, the Quiet Is Violent World Tour, which began in September 2014 and ended in November of the same year.[60]
