The HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space values, also known as HSB (hue, saturation, brightness), and the hex triplets (for HTML web colors) are also given in the following table. Colors that appear on the web-safe color palette—which includes the sixteen named colors—are noted.[1] (Those four named colors corresponding to the neutral grays have no hue value, which is effectively ignored—i.e., left blank.)
