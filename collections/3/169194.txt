The tube closes overnight. The first trains run from about 05:00 and the last trains until just after 01:00, with later starting times at weekends.[191][192] The nightly closures are used for maintenance,[191] but some lines stay open on New Year's Eve[193] and run for longer hours during major public events such as the 2012 London Olympics.[194] Some lines are occasionally closed for scheduled engineering work at weekends.[195]
