In the 1940s, O'Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the "Black Place", about 150 miles west of her Ghost Ranch house.[50] O'Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled "a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet."[41] She made paintings of the "White Place", a white rock formation located near her Abiqui√∫ house.[51]
