Except for this difference between ACR (types A and D) and plumbing (types K, L, M and DWV) pipes, the type only indicates wall thickness and does not affect the outside diameter of the tube. Type K ​1⁄2 inch, type L ​1⁄2 inch, and type D ​5⁄8 inch ACR all have the same outside diameter of ​5⁄8 inch.
