The novel's content has been the frequent target of censors. It ranks number 8 on the American Library Association list of most commonly challenged books in the United States for 1990–1999.[1] On the ALA list for 2000–2009 it ranks #28.[7] The challenges stem from death being a part of the plot;[8][9] Jesse's frequent use of the word "lord" outside of prayer;[10] allegations that it promotes secular humanism, New Age religion, occultism, and Satanism;[11] and for use of offensive language.[12]
