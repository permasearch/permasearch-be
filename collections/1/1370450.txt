Despite slipping ratings and a fear the show would be axed, NBC announced in March 2005 that The West Wing would be returning for a seventh season.[47] The change from Wednesdays to Sundays cost the show approximately 30 percent of its audience;[42] the first two episodes of the season garnered the series' lowest ever ratings and Deseret News said the move of time slot sealed the show's fate.[48][49] In January 2006, it was announced that the seventh would be the final season. Kevin Reilly, entertainment president for NBC, said that after poor viewing figures for the "last couple of seasons [they reached] a point where you look at the ratings and you just say, 'it's time.'"[50]
