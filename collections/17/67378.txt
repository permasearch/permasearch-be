Paper Lace's version of "Billy Don't Be a Hero" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1974,[1] and did likewise in Australia, where it spent eight weeks at the top spot. Thereafter, Bo Donaldson's and the Heywoods's version reached number one in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 on 15 June 1974, and number one in Canada on 7 July. The US version sold over three and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1974. Donaldson's and the Heywoods's version was a massive hit in North America, but it remained largely unknown elsewhere as of late July 2017. Billboard ranked it as the No. 21 song for 1974.
