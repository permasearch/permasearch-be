Since the origins of the image were not widely known for several years after XP's release, there has been considerable speculation about where the landscape was. Some guesses have included locations in France, England, Switzerland, the North Otago region of New Zealand, and southeastern Washington.[11] Dutch users believed the photograph was shot in Ireland's County Kerry since the image was named "Ierland" in the Dutch release of the software; similarly, the image was named "Alentejo" in the Portuguese version, leading users speaking that language to believe it had been taken in the eponymous region of Portugal.[8]
