There has been extensive habitat destruction (pollution, dams, and drainage for irrigation) in the Chao Phraya basin and overfishing also presents a problem.[16][21][22][23] Within mainland Southeast Asia, the only freshwater region with similar high levels of threat is the lower Mekong.[16] It has been estimated that only around 30 native fish species still are able to reproduce in the mainstream of the Chao Phraya River.[16]
