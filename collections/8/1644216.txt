Related to the MTA's East Side Access project is its long-planned widening of the two-track LIRR Main Line by adding a third track.[116][117] Completion of Main Line third track construction was assumed during East Side Access project planning and referenced in the original East Side Access environmental impact statement as necessary to support service level increases caused by adding service to and from Grand Central.[118] The MTA has said that it considers the Main Line third track an "essential" project to support East Side Access,[119] and that the Main Line third track will "complement the East Side Access megaproject, which is doubling the LIRRâ€™s capacity into Manhattan."[117]
