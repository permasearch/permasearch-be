The game was also called on radio by Al Helfer for the Mutual network, by Buck Canel and Felo Ram√≠rez for a Spanish language network, and by Nat Allbright in a studio re-creation for the Dodgers' secondary network in the South. Harry Caray, who had called St. Louis Cardinals games during the season, was in the WMCA booth with Hodges and may have also participated in broadcasting the game.[30][31]
