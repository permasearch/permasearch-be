The XR250R was introduced pre 1981, and was originally equipped with a variation of the engine that had powered the XL250S since 1978. For 1983 the model was dropped from Honda's line-up, but came back in 1984 with a completely new engine dubbed the "Radial Four Valve Chamber" (RFVC) engine. The original 250 cc (15 cu in) RFVC engine had a bore and stroke of 75 mm × 56.5 mm (2.95 in × 2.22 in), but in 1986 this was changed to 73 mm × 59.5 mm (2.87 in × 2.34 in). 1986 also saw the adoption of a large, single carburetor rather than the dual progressively opening carburetors of the 84-85 models. In 1996 the engine of the XR 250R, the mainstay of the XR range, was updated and now produced 19 hp (14 kW) at 8100 rpm.[6]  Changes included a new crankcase with better engine mounts (which incorporated the swingarm pivot) for a stiffer chassis, smaller exhaust valves to address a problem with cracking cylinder heads, and an improved automatic decompressor for easier starting.  Although the XR250R was always quite heavy compared to its 2 stroke competition and both front and rear suspension were rather basic, it proved reliable and likable and was successful as an entry-level off-road machine.  The XR250R was discontinued after 2004.
