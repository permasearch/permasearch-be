The aye-aye is classically considered 'solitary' as they have not been observed to groom each other.[citation needed] However, recent research suggests it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to 80 acres (320,000 m2), while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to 20 acres (81,000 m2). It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.[23] Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.[24]
