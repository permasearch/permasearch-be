"Foux Du Fafa"[1] (a.k.a. Foux Da Fa Fa[2]), is sung in French but consists almost entirely of beginner French phrases such as "OÃ¹ est la piscine?" (Where is the swimming pool?), many of which contain grammatical errors. The title itself, "Foux Du Fafa", is just a nonsense phrase and has no meaning in French. The visuals that accompany this song are in the style of a 1960s Scopitone music video.
