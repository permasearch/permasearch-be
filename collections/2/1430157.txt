While benzodiazepines may have short-term benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2â€“4 weeks) use can result in a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality,[108][109] disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep,[110] withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders,[108][109] inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction,[111][112][113] and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress.[114] Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines.[108][115] Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.[108][116]
