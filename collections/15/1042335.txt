Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707â€“1751) is often said to have died of complications after being hit by a cricket ball, although the connection between the incident and his official cause of death is unproven. Glamorgan player Roger Davis was almost killed by a ball in 1971 when he was hit on the head while fielding.[21] The Indian batsman Nariman 'Nari' Contractor had to retire from the game after being hit by a ball on the head in the West Indies in 1962.[22]
