Islands develop from coral reefs through one of two processes, uplift and accretion.[1] In uplift, part or all of the coral reef becomes land as a result of the earth's crust rising above sea level.[1] In accretion, rocks and sand are layered on top of coral reefs during cyclonic storms, and the gradual accumulation of other solid material through the action of wind and waves leads to the development of the island.[2] The process is later enhanced with the remains of plant life which grows on the island.
