Rover purportedly tied helium balloons to various objects to see how many it would take to lift them off the ground. One was supposedly a kitten, "Jinxy the Cat", which escaped on a 45-minute flight, followed closely by Cleveland television stations and prompting 911 calls from concerned listeners.[16] The stunt was copied by radio stations in Philadelphia, Denver and in New York by Nick Cannon.[17] Rover later said "No, there was no cat out there. It was all theater of the minds."[17]
