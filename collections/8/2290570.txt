Plutarch in his "Sayings of the Spartans" also mentions this comment, but he attributes it to Leonidas I, Dienekes' general in the battle. According to Plutarch, when one of the soldiers complained to Leonidas that "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun," Leonidas replied, "Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?"[4] The "Laconic saying" of "then we will fight in the shade" was cited by Latin writers such as Cicero (in umbra igitur pugnabimus, Tusculan Disputations I.42) and Valerius Maximus (in umbra enim proeliabimur, III.7, ext. 8).
