When New Mexico became a state in 1912, the Legislature named a Commission for the purpose of designing a state seal. In June 1913, the Commission, which consisted of Governor William C. McDonald, Attorney General Frank W. Clancy, Chief Justice Clarence J. Roberts and Secretary of State Antonio Lucero, filed its report adopting the general design of the Territorial Seal, substituting only the date 1912. That seal is still in use today as the official seal of New Mexico.
