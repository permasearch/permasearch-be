The episode "T.A.H.I.T.I." introduces the Kree alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy.[162][163] This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU,[4] with Jed Whedon saying that it was something "in the works" for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film."[164] The third season introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,[6][165] while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline.[166] Gregg noted in January 2016 that the "writer and director [of the Inhumans film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that."[167] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had "a little more freedom" and were "able to do a little bit more" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the "classic" Inhumans.[168] Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.[169] It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.[170]
