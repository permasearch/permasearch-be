There is no evidence of a professional priesthood among the Norse, and rather cultic activities were carried out by members of the community who also had other social functions and positions.[287] In Old Norse society, religious authority was harnessed to secular authority; there was no separation between economic, political, and symbolic institutions.[288] Both the Norwegian kings' sagas and Adam of Bremen's account claim that kings and chieftains played a prominent role in cultic sacrifices.[287] In medieval Iceland, the goði was a social role that combined religious, political, and judicial functions,[287] responsible for serving as a chieftain in the district, negotiating legal disputes, and maintaining order among his þingmenn.[289] Most evidence suggests that public cultic activity was largely the preserve of high-status males in Old Norse society.[290] However, there are exceptions. The Landnámabók refers to two women holding the position of gyðja, both of whom were members of local chiefly families.[289] In Ibn Fadlan's account of the Rus, he describes an elder woman known as the "Angel of Death" who oversaw a funerary ritual.[291]
