In 1998, the Boston Red Sox selected DiNardo in the 10th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign, opting to attend Stetson University instead.[2] Three years later, he would sign with the New York Mets when they selected him in the 3rd round.[3] In the summer of 2001, DiNardo made his professional debut with the Brooklyn Cyclones, the Mets Single-A affiliate.[4]
