Isolation refers to separating those who are sick from those who are not. Quarantine refers to separating those who may have been exposed to a disease until they either show signs of the disease or are no longer at risk.[116] Quarantine, also known as enforced isolation, is usually effective in decreasing spread.[117][118] Governments often quarantine areas where the disease is occurring or individuals who may transmit the disease outside of an initial area.[119]  In the United States, the law allows quarantine of those infected with ebolaviruses.[120]
