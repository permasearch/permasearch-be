The film's entire recording process took approximately three years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively.[14] Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately,[14] which took Kelly some time to get used to because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of live-action films.[13] For The Lion King, a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of.[13] Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, "it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role.[14] Because Nala is a "very straight character", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task.[13] Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress.[14] In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala.[16][17] According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' "biggest role to date".[18] A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song "I Just Can't Wait to Be King";[16] the singer was 15 years old at the time.[16] Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song "Can You Feel the Love Tonight".[16] The film's love theme, "Can You Feel the Love Tonight"'s lyrics were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist Tim Rice, who wrote the song alongside composer Elton John.[16] At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa,[4][19] despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind.[20] However, John lobbied in favor of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" being a love song performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed.[16]
