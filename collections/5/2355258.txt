Another finding is a six-fold excess of binding sites insensitive to the testing agent, raclopride;[42][43] Seeman said this increase was probably due to the increase in D2 monomers.[30] Such an increase in monomers may occur via the cooperativity mechanism[44] which is responsible for D2High and D2Low, the supersensitive and lowsensitivity states of the D2 dopamine receptor.[45] More specifically, "an increase in monomers, may be one basis for dopamine supersensitivity".[46]
