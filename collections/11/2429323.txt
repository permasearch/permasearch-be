Most infants, though not all, will reflexively hold their breath when submerged to protect their airway and are able to survive immersion in water for short periods of time.[2] Infants can also be taken to swimming lessons. Although this may be done to reduce their risk of drowning, the effects on drowning risk are not reliable.[3] It is extremely important to note that while babies can imitate swimming motions and reflexes, they are not yet physically capable of swimming.
