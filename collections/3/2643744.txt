There is evidence that A. sinensis may affect the muscles of the uterus. Women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant should not use A. sinensis, because it may induce a miscarriage.[5] Taking A. sinensis can cause skin to become extra sensitive to the sun, leading to a greater risk for skin cancer.[5] One case of gynaecomastia has been reported following consumption of dong quai root powder pills.[10] Large and prolonged doses of the plant is not advised as it contains compounds that are considered carcinogenic.[5]
