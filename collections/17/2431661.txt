In 2005, the Fugees embarked on a European tour - their first together since 1997 - from November 30 to December 20, playing in Finland, Austria, Norway, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia. They had been scheduled to play at the Hammersmith Apollo on 25 November 2005; however they were forced to move the gig to December due to production issues.[8] The tour received mixed reviews. On February 6, 2006, the group reunited for a free show in Hollywood, with tickets given away to about 8,000 fans by local radio stations. Later that month, a new track called "Foxy" was leaked, a song dubbed the "REAL return of the Fugees" by several online MP3 blogs.
