George C. Homans was born in Boston on August 11, 1910, son of Robert and Abigail (Adams) Homans, he was the great-great grandson of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States, and great-great-great grandson of John Adams, the second President of the United States. "At George's birth, his mother wrote to her Uncle Henry: 'His head is a mass of lumps which will make him look very distinguished when, as a bald old gentleman, he sits upon the bench dispensing justice.' "[1] Through this letter she also explains how Homans received his name: "He is to be named George Caspar for my brother, as the Homans family did not consider that I was the sort of person to produce a good doctor, and so reserved the name [John] for my brother-in-law Jack's benefit..."(Homans 1984:1). The Homanses came from a lineage of distinguished doctors that began when the first John Homans came to the country from Ramsgate, Kent, England in the 18th century. His son, Dr. John Homans, who graduated from Harvard, was the first to become a doctor and begin the reputation of the John Homanses (Homans 1984:1-2). However, "George's father was a lawyer, but George was the first member of the family to eschew the law".[1]
