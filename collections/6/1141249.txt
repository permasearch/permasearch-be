Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 provides two different mechanisms under which a landlord can give notice to obtain possession of their property. In either case, since the coming into force of the Housing Act 1996, the notice must be in writing.[vi] An agent of the landlord may give the notice on behalf of the landlord. Where there are joint landlords, the notice may be given by any one of them.
