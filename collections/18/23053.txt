In 1934, the lease amount that formerly was paid in gold coin was instead paid with U.S. dollars per the Gold Reserve Act so it was adjusted to account for the value of gold into U.S. dollars, which set it at $3,386.25.[30] The lease amount was further adjusted in 1973 to $3,676.50 and in 1974 to $4,085, based on further revisions to the value of gold into U.S. dollars.[31] Payments have been sent annually, but only one lease payment has been accepted since the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro claimed that this check was deposited due to confusion in 1959, and the Cuban government has not deposited any other lease checks since that time.[32]
