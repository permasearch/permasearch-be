If a person besides Le has the allele Se (i.e. is a secretor), their exocrine cells will also have the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2, adding fucose to the oligosaccharide precursor in terminal position. The combined action of the two enzymes will produce antigen Le-b. In most people having both Le and Se, it is difficult to detect antigen Le-a because it is converted to Le-b very efficiently. Therefore, people with readily detectable Lewis-a antigen are non-secretors, i.e. do not secrete A, B or H antigens, while Lewis-b antigen is found only in secretors. Lewis negative people (Le a-, Le b-) are homozygous for the recessive le allele and can be either secretors or non-secretors.
