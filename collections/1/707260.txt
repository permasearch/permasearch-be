Length estimates for rivers depend on a number of variables. 1) The estimate will be larger when the river’s curves are traced at a smaller scale. 2) The choice of the source obviously has an impact. Here we attempt to list the most distant source. When that involves a tributary nearer the mouth of the river, the length of the nominal river is listed as well, if it meets the above criteria. 3) Rivers flowing into estuaries have an arbitrary end. Its channel through an estuary is usually included in the length when it is exposed at low tide. 4) The length of a watercourse through a reservoir or lake is open for interpretation. For this table, when a source for the total length of a river system involving lakes is lacking, the shortest courses through the lakes is used. 5) Over time, a river’s length can change (usually decrease) through canalization, the creation of reservoirs, and natural changes in the water course.
