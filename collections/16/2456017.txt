Fourteen quotes from King's speeches, sermons, and writings are inscribed on the Inscription Wall.[41] The "Council of Historians" created to choose the quotations included Maya Angelou, Lerone Bennett, Clayborne Carson, Henry Louis Gates, Marianne Williamson and others,[42][43] though the memorial's executive architect stated that Maya Angelou did not attend the meetings at which the quotations were selected.[44] According to the official National Park Service brochure for the Memorial, the inscriptions that were chosen "stress four primary messages of Dr. King: justice, democracy, hope, and love."[45]
