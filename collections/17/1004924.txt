On July 5, 1984, Forethought hired Robert Gaskins as its vice president of product development[22](p51) to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers, such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh.[23] Gaskins produced his initial description of PowerPoint about a month later (August 14, 1984) in the form of a 2-page document titled "Presentation Graphics for Overhead Projection."[24] By October 1984 Gaskins had selected Dennis Austin to be the developer for PowerPoint.[25] Gaskins and Austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year, and produced the first specification document dated August 21, 1985.[26] This first design document showed a product as it would look in Microsoft Windows 1.0,[27] which at that time had not been released.[28]
