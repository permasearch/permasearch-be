In December 2010, the tree, then 30 feet (9.1Â m) tall,[55] was returned to the World Trade Center site in a ceremony attended by Bloomberg, city officials[56] (including Parks and Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe and Port Authority executive director Chris Ward), survivors and rescue and recovery workers.[55][56] Although the tree is a prominent part of the memorial,[61] six other "survivor trees" have been planted near New York City Hall and the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge. Of these survivor trees, three are callery pears and three are little-leaf lindens.[62]
