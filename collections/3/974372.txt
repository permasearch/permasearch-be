Sometime within the following months, Duane falls prey to the walkers and gets turned. Morgan, unable to cope with the death of his son, resorts to locking Duane in the house with chains. As his mental and physical health deteriorates, he begins murdering survivors who pass by so he can feed the boy. Rick, along with his son Carl and new second-in-command Abraham, arrive back to the town with the plan to bring Morgan into the group, which he agrees to after freeing his zombie son.[3] He quickly develops an intense fixation on Carl, who reminds him of Duane.[4] While in the group, he becomes one of the primary defenders of their campsite, and deepens his bond with Michonne, the two of them both connecting due to their damaged psyches and history of loss.[5] At the same time, he attempts to deepen his bond with Carl after witnessing first-hand the boy's cold-blooded mentality.[6] He believes himself to be responsible for maintaining Carl's childhood innocence and is determined to make amends for his failure to protect Duane.
