The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive.[120] These are called cytopathic effects.[121] Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis.[122] Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.[123]
