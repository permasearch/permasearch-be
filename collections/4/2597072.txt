Vanderbilt and Ole Miss have played annually since 1942. When the SEC split into divisions in 1992, the Commodores and Rebels were selected as permanent cross-division rivals. Though Vanderbilt won the first 18 games in the rivalry, Ole Miss leads the all-time series 50–39–2. As of late, this rivalry hasn't gotten as much attention as other rivalries in the SEC as the Rebels have won 16 of the last 24, nine of which were won by double digits. However, the rivalry continues to grow following Vanderbilt's surprising blow-out victory over the Rebels in 2016.
