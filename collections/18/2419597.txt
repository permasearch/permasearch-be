Irish Americans make up approximately 5.3% of New York City's population, composing the second largest non-Hispanic white ethnic group.[110] Irish Americans first came to America in colonial years (pre-1776), with immigration rising in the 1820s due to poor living conditions in Ireland.[111] But the largest wave of Irish immigration came after the Great Famine in 1845.[111]
