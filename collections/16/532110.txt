The expression "1 g = 7000980665000000000♠9.80665 m/s2" means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes 7000980665000000000♠9.80665 meters per second (≡7000980665000000000♠35.30394 km/h). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as 7000980665000000000♠9.80665 (meter per second) per second, or 7000980665000000000♠9.80665 m/s2. For example: An acceleration of 1 g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 kilometres per hour (22 mph) for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of braking at 1 g and is traveling at 35 kilometres per hour (22 mph) it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1 g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105 km/h (65 mph), can brake to a standstill in three seconds.
