Planet Fitness was founded in 1992, in Dover, New Hampshire, when Michael and Marc Grondahl acquired a financially struggling gym and dramatically reduced prices to compete against better-known brands.[5] This low-cost business model focuses on the needs of occasional or first-time health club members, rather than more experienced members.[4]
