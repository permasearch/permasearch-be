Augustine of Hippo also objected to the continuance in his native North Africa of the custom of such meals, in which some indulged to the point of drunkenness, and he distinguished them from proper celebration of the Eucharist: "Let us take the body of Christ in communion with those with whom we are forbidden to eat even the bread which sustains our bodies."[44] He reports that even before the time of his stay in Milan, the custom had already been forbidden there.[45] Canons 27 and 28 of the Council of Laodicea (364) restricted the abuses.[46]
