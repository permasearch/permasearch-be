In Casino Royale, Fleming writes that Bond bought the car "almost new" in 1933 and had it stored during the war, which is mentioned in the Young Bond novel Double or Die. In Live and Let Die Fleming states the automobile's year as 1933, however in Moonraker Fleming states it is from 1930. This earlier date is the correct one, as the Bentley 4Â½ Litre ceased production in 1930.
