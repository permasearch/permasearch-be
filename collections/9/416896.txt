During and after the expansion of runway 10R/28L, reconstruction of Terminal Four will begin at the cost of $450 million. The H concourse will be demolished to build the new "G" concourse. In this process four new gates will be added. Concession space will be increased from 2,128 ft² to 28,000 ft² and a secure walkway will be added to connect terminals three and four.[21]
