Purple martins are fairly noisy, chirping and making sounds that have been described as chortles, rattles, and croaks.[5] The various calls are said to be "throaty and rich" and can be rendered as tchew-wew, pew pew, choo, cher, zweet and zwrack. The males have a gurgling and guttural courtship song, a dawn song, and even a subsong used at the end of the breeding season.[5][12] Tapes of purple martin song are sold to attract martins to newly established birdhouses.
