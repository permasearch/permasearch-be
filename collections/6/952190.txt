In What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted", CeCe is at the Brew when Emily spots her and starts asking questions about "Beach Hottie," She leaves, stating that she doesn't have time to answer questions since she has to get pictures for her store's website. She winds up calling Aria, to ask if she could help with the photos, since the first photographer she hired was unprofessional. CeCe later leaves Aria and Wesley alone to go get some dinner and never returns. She calls to tell them her car got towed, but she is lying because she is sitting in her car while making that phone call. Only minutes prior, Jason and Emily were involved in an elevator accident - an act of deliberate sabotage. In this same episode, Jason relays a flashback to Emily of the night Ali disappeared. He recalled seeing 'Alison' arguing with Melissa near his house, but when he called her name, it was CeCe who turned her head around. At the end of the episode, two 'A's play "spin the bottle" with pictures of the Liars on whiskey bottles. The flask ends up pointing on Aria, but Big A turns it to Spencer and then, both of them drink the whiskey.
