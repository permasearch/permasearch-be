On 13 September 2017, the BBC formally announced that it had ordered a first series of three episodes. In a press release, it was revealed that along with Angela Merkel, Nicola Sturgeon and Theresa May, Ullman would be adding her take on the current First Lady of France Brigitte Macron and British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. "I am thrilled to be allowed to Break the News again with my fantastic team of writers and performers. It’s wonderful that there is so much comedy to be found in the world’s current terrifying doom spiral. These are uncertain times, but I have my money on Angela Merkel to win the German election - don’t let me down Angela, you are like my Dot in EastEnders. Theresa May - hang in there, I’m not done with you yet, and Nicola Sturgeon - all power to your elbow hen, I promise my accent will be 10% better this season. I can’t wait to play new characters including the glamorous FLOF (First Lady of France) Brigitte Macron and a certain Labour leader, who we imagine has a marvellous sense of humour and will no doubt be delighted to see himself depicted by a middle aged woman (please don’t shave your beard off Jeremy, we’ve just had one made). Onward!"[13][14][15]
