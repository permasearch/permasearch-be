Though lawyers in the United States do not customarily use the title, the law degree in that country is the Juris Doctor, a professional doctorate.[103] Some J.D. holders in the United States use the title of doctor in professional situations, although ethics board decisions have varied on whether this is permissible or might mislead the public into believing the lawyer was medically qualified or had a PhD.[104][105] It is also sometimes used by J.D. holders in academic situations.[106][107] In 2011, Mother Jones published an article claiming that Michele Bachmann was misrepresenting her qualifications by using the "bogus" title Dr. based on her J.D. They later amended the article to note that the use of the title by lawyers "is a (begrudgingly) accepted practice in some states and not in others", although they maintained that it was rarely used as it "suggests that you're a medical doctor or a Ph.D.â€”and therefore conveys a false level of expertise".[108]
