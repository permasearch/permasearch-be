In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a marked increase in American imports of Chinese goods. China’s central bank allegedly devalued yuan by buying large amounts of US dollars with yuan, thus increasing the supply of the yuan in the foreign exchange market, while increasing the demand for US dollars, thus increasing the price of USD.[citation needed] According to an article published in KurzyCZ by Vladimir Urbanek, by December 2012, China’s foreign exchange reserve held roughly $3.3 trillion, making it the highest foreign exchange reserve in the world. Roughly 60% of this reserve was composed of US government bonds and debentures.[25]
