"If We Must Die" is a 1919 poem by Claude McKay published in the July issue of The Liberator. McKay wrote the poem as a response to mob attacks by white Americans upon African-American communities during Red Summer.[1] The poem was later reprinted in The Messenger of the same year. The poem would also be read in Congress by Republican Senator from Massachusetts Henry Cabot Lodge.
