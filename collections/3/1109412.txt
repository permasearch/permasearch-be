In subsequent research experiments, Asch explored several variations on the paradigm from his 1951 study.[2] Retaining the use of male college students, these variations varied the size of the group (from seven to nine); the number of trials (12 trials with 7 being critical, rather than 18 with 12 being critical trials). Asch also experimented with adding a second "real" participant.
