Her species has been inconsistently labeled in various Land Before Time media. While the official website referred to her as a Parasaurolophus,[20] she has also been identified as the similar species Saurolophus, which she more closely resembles, in the 1997 The Land Before Time Sing-Along Songs video cassette. Many sources have also referred to her as an Anatosaurus, including Jerry Beck's The Animated Movie Guide[10] and David Mansour's From Abba to Zoom: A Pop-Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century.[21] In her review of the 1988 film, Wendy Miller of the Mohave Daily Miner referred to the character as "an adorably gregarious young anatosaurus who immediately wins the audiences heart."[6]
