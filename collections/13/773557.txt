The all-time maximum peak load is not exceeding 158,713 MW in the unified grid whereas the all-time peak load met is 156,058 MW on 9 September 2016.[149] The maximum achieved demand factor of substations is not exceeding 60% at 200 kV level. The operational performance of the huge capacity substations and the vast network of high voltage transmission lines with low demand factor is not satisfactory in meeting the peak electricity load.[150][151] Detailed forensic engineering studies are to be undertaken and system inadequacies rectified to evolve into smart grid for maximising utility of the existing transmission infrastructure with optimum future capital investments.[39]
