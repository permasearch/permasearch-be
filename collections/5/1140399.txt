Holmes sets up a small fire in one room of the house with a little straw, and tells three of his constables to shout "Fire!". Lestrade and Watson are quite astonished at what happens next: the very much still living Mr. Oldacre emerges from a hidden chamber at the end of a hallway—where Holmes has deduced it must be—and runs to escape the fire. He is immediately seized.
