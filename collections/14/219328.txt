North Vietnam's leader Ho Chi Minh met with Chinese leader Mao Zedong in China.  Ho said that North Vietnam would "take the main burden of the war by themselves" but requested additional Chinese economic and military support.  Mao agreed and they set the ground rules for Chinese assistance: North Vietnamese soldiers would fight the war with Chinese logistical help, but the Chinese would not intervene militarily unless the United States invaded North Vietnam.
