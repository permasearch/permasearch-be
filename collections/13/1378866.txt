The Forester was introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show in November 1995 as the Streega concept, and made available for sale February 1997 in Japan, and to the US market in 1997 for MY1998. The Forester was one of the first emerging crossover SUVs.[3] It was built in the style of a car, but had a taller stance, higher h-point seating, and an all-wheel drive drive train. Subaru advertising employed the slogan "SUV tough, Car Easy". It used the Impreza platform but with the larger 2.5-litre DOHC EJ25D four-cylinder boxer engine from the Subaru Outback, making 123 kW (165 hp; 167 PS) at 5,600 rpm and 220 N⋅m (162 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm.
