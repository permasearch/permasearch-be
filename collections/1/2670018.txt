The first use of the name "chimpanze" is recorded in The London Magazine in 1738,[3] glossed as meaning "mockman" in a language of "the Angolans" (apparently from a Bantu language, reportedly modern Vili (Civili), a Zone H Bantu language, has the comparable ci-mpenzi[4]). The spelling chimpanzee is found in a 1758 supplement to Chamber's Cyclop√¶dia.[5] The colloquialism "chimp" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.[6][7]
