The UCLA trademark "is the exclusive property of the Regents of the University of California",[145] but it is managed, protected, and licensed through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing, a division of the Associated Students UCLA, the largest student employer on campus.[146][147] As such, the ASUCLA also has a share in the profits.
