Sweet tea began as an item of luxury due to the expensive nature of tea, ice, and sugar.[1][2] Ice was possibly the most valued of the ingredients since it had to be shipped from afar at a time when access to cool drinking water was already a relative luxury.[2] In modern times it can be made in large quantities quickly and inexpensively.[2]
