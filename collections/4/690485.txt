In the semi-finals of the 2011 Davis Cup, Djokovic played a crucial rubber match for Serbia against Juan MartÃ­n del Potro of Argentina, where he retired while trailing, after reaggravating a back injury sustained during the US Open tournament. This secured Argentina's place in the final. This marked Djokovic's third loss of his 2011 season, and his second retirement.[119]
