Although at one time red deer were rare in parts of Europe, they were never close to extinction. Reintroduction and conservation efforts, such as in the United Kingdom and in Portugal,[7] have resulted in an increase of red deer populations, while other areas, such as North Africa, have continued to show a population decline.
