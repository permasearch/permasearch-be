Woh Kaun Thi? (Hindi: वो कौन थी, English: Who Was She?) is a 1964 black-and-white psychological mystery film directed by Raj Khosla, starring Sadhana Shivdasani, Manoj Kumar and Prem Chopra. Though the screenplay was written by Dhruva Chatterjee, parts were later rewritten, wherein Manoj Kumar took an active role. Music by Madan Mohan was the asset of this movie. The film became a hit at the box office.[1] Its success had Khosla directing Sadhana in two more suspense thrillers: Mera Saaya (1966) and Anita (1967).
