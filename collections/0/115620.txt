The first series of The Great British Bake Off, first aired on BBC Two on 17 August 2010. Ten home bakers took part in a bake-off to test every aspect of their baking skills as they battled to be crowned the Great British Bake Off's best amateur baker. Each week the nationwide tour saw bakers put through three challenges in a particular discipline, with some being eliminated from competition at the end of the episode. The rounds of the competition took place in various locations across the UK following a theme, for example, the episode on puddings would take place in Bakewell, bread baking would take place near Sandwich.[1][2] This first series had a voiceover by Stephen Noonan; for the subsequent series this role was taken by the on-screen presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. The competition was won by Edd Kimber.[3][4][5]
