The term digital is suggested by George Stibitz and refers to all applications based on signals with two states  – low (0) and high (1). That is why the decimal and binary computing are two ways to implement digital computing. A mathematical basis of digital computing is Boolean algebra, developed by the British mathematician George Boole in his work The Laws of Thought, published in 1854. His Boolean algebra was further refined in the 1860s by William Jevons and Charles Sanders Peirce, and was first presented systematically by Ernst Schröder and A. N. Whitehead.[64] In 1879 Gottlob Frege develops the formal approach to logic and proposes the first logic language for logical equations.[65]
