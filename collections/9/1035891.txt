Chopper and the Ghost appear in the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.[66] Hera's surname is also called on a loudspeaker at the Rebel base on Yavin IV, where Chopper can briefly be seen. In addition, the Ghost takes part in the climactic battle over Scarif during the eponymous squad's attempt to steal the Death Star plans, providing assistance in defending the Rebel fleet under attack by the Imperial Navy, while other Rebels attempt to disable the shield gate over the planet.[67]
