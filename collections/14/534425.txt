In the lead-up to the 2013 tournament, the ICC announced that the 2013 Champions Trophy was to be the last,[14] with its place in the cricketing calendar to be taken by a new ICC World Test Championship.[15] However, in January 2014, that decision was reversed, due to the massive success of the 2013 edition, with the ICC confirming that the 2017 Champions Trophy tournament would take place and the proposed Test Championship was cancelled.[16] England and Wales hosted the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.Â England became the only country to host the Champions Trophy thrice, and England and Wales became the only countries to host the ICC Champions Trophy consecutively, also hosting the 2013 edition. Bangladesh replaced the West Indies, who finished outside the top eight in ninth position, in the ICC ODI Team Rankings on the cut-off date. Bangladesh returned to the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since 2006, and, for the first time, the West Indies failed to qualify.
