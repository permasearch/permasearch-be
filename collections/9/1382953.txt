Baikal is one of the clearest lakes in the world.[10] During the winter in open sections the water transparency can be as much as 30–40 m (98–131 ft), but during the summer it is typically 5–8 m (16–26 ft).[25] Baikal is rich in oxygen, even in deep sections,[25] which separates it from the distinctly stratified bodies of water such as Lake Tanganyika and the Black Sea.[26][27]
