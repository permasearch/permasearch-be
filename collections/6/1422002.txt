The Canadian forces missed the early period of the war and the great British defeats of Black Week. The Canadians in South Africa won much acclaim for leading the charge at the Second Battle of Paardeberg, one of the first decisive victories of the war.[172] At the Battle of Leliefontein on November 7, 1900, three Canadians, Lieutenant Turner, Lieutenant Cockburn, Sergeant Holland and Arthur Richardson of the Royal Canadian Dragoons were awarded the Victoria Cross for protecting the rear of a retreating force.[173] Ultimately, over 8,600 Canadians volunteered to fight.[174] Lieutenant Harold Lothrop Borden, however, became the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War.[175] About 7,400 Canadians,[176] including many female nurses, served in South Africa.[177] Of these, 224 died, 252 were wounded, and several were decorated with the Victoria Cross.[178] Canadian forces also participated in the British-led concentration camp programs that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Boer civilians.[179]
