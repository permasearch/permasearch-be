Rudolph's legacy lies in her efforts to overcome obstacles that included childhood illnesses and a physical disability to become the fastest woman runner in the world in 1960. At the 1960 Rome Olympics, she became the first American woman, as well as the first African American woman, to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad. Rudolph was one of the first role models for black and female athletes. Her Olympic success "gave a tremendous boost to women's track in the United States."[8] Rudolph's celebrity also caused gender barriers to be broken at previously all-male track and field events such as the Millrose Games.[8]
