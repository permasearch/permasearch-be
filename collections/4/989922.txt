Celeste's therapist advises her to prepare to leave Perry by renting an apartment and disclosing the abuse to friends, who could serve as witnesses in a potential custody battle. Later, Perry tries to initiate sex with Celeste. When rejected, he grabs her by the hair and she defensively hits him in the groin with a tennis racquet, fracturing his penis. Returning from the hospital, he tells Celeste she is "lucky" he didn't kill her. The following day she begins looking for an apartment.
