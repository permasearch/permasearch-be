In the Netflix TV series, Carmelita Spats is portrayed by Kitana Turnbull.[7] Unlike the books, Carmelita was the one who snuck Count Olaf and his troupe into Prufrock Preparatory School upon Count Olaf making a deal with her through the bleachers. In addition, she also helped Count Olaf and the White-Faced Women trap Larry in the walk-in freezer. The series also comically depicts her literally sniffing cakes which she does in secret in the middle of the night when nobody is looking.
