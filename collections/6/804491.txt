Peri's storylines include discovering her sister, Leela (Kirsty-Leigh Porter), is actually her biological mother, being diagnosed with a brain tumour, falling down the stairs in the village because of the tumour and becoming pregnant at the age of 14. Another well-known storyline is her relationship with Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins). In July 2016, Peri was involved in a bullying storyline where she and her friend Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) taunted teenage cancer patient Jade Albright (Kassius Nelson). Later that month, Peri and Nico became trapped in an abandoned bunker, where the ceiling collapsed on Peri.
