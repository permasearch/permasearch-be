New Zealand is considered to have abundant marine energy resources, although these are yet to be tapped. The Kaipara Tidal Power Station is being developed in the Kaipara Harbour and marine current projects in Cook Strait are under consideration. The Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association was established by firms and people interested in promoting New Zealand marine energy.
