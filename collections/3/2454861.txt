Trump, who owned the Miss Universe franchise, which includes the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants, was also accused to have walked into dressing rooms of contestants while they were in varying stages of undress without prior notice of his arrival.[786] Trump has said in an interview with Howard Stern in 2005, "no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant. And therefore I'm inspecting it... Is everyone OK? You know, they're standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that. [...] I'll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else."[787]
