A hill divides the two lakes, the larger one is called Bhim Taal or just Tikkar Taal which is 550 meter wide and 460 meter long[4][5] and the smaller one is called Draupdi Taal or Chota Tikkar Taal (meaning the little tikkar lake) is 365 meter wide and long,[5][4] as the legend goes there is a hidden channel linking them, as the water level of two lakes remains roughly the same. Morni locals look upon the lakes as sacred.[6]
