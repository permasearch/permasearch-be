The gospel of Matthew was written by an author who believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah, "God with us".[8][9] At first, titles such as "Messiah" and "son of God" had described Jesus's future nature at the "deutera parousia", the Second Coming; but very soon he came to be recognised as having become the Son of God at the resurrection; then, in Mark, he becomes known as Son of God at his baptism; and finally Matthew and Luke add infancy narratives in which Jesus is the Son of God from the very beginning, long before being conceived of a virgin mother without a human father.[10] However, Paul's letter to the Philippians (an earlier text than any of the gospels) identifies Jesus as being in the form of God before his birth. (Phillipians 2:6-11)
