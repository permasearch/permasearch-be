This was Jeff Daniels and Harland Williams' second movie together; both had previously appeared in Dumb and Dumber (1994). The rat used for the beginning of the church scene is male, it then switches to being a female rat, and back again between shots. During the scene where the animals get loose, the same event is used twice. When Opal picks up the black and white rabbit to place in its pen, it is shown once as a close up of her [at 33:41 from behind] and once from a distance [at 33:58 frontal]. (This can be clearly seen in the full frame version, but not in the wide screen version at 33:41 where the wide screen cropping of the spherical 35 mm frames crop out the body of the rabbit. Consequently, it is a goof in re-mastering the full frame version from the spherical 35 mm negatives rather than a goof in the wide screen film. Of course, it could be argued that the rabbit got out again and needed to be put into the pen a second time.) In the scene where Opal brings Winn-Dixie into the church, when she gets up from her seat to get Winn-Dixie, there is a Bible and a purse on the chair beside her. After she returns from getting Winn-Dixie, there is somebody sitting in the seat beside her holding the Bible while the purse is on the floor between the two chairs. Opal's hair length varies throughout the movie, from a short blunt cut, to a longer, and uneven cut, and then back to short. When it starts raining, at the start of the garden party, all of the lights strung around start to flicker and go out. Except when you see everyone standing at the house, the lights to the right can be seen still on. Opal's hair changes from straight and flat to styled and blow-dried during the baseball game and party set-up scenes. The "mouse" Winn Dixie catches during the church service is a rat.
