Kim tells Stella that she wants her to speak to Nathan, but Stella's trying to think of reasons why she shouldn't. Kim tells Stella that she's not a good mother, but she still wants her as long as she's with Nathan. Stella calls Nathan, and as Kim goes out later, she meets him on the doorstep. Nathan tells Stella that she's turned him into a man that he never wanted to be, and that he thinks Stella should leave. As Kim walks past Tom, he is smoking a cigarette and appears to have his own crew. He tells them that he 'had her and her girlfriend', to the amazement of the people around him. He then chokes on his cigarette, throws it away, hands his trombone to one of the people, and walks down the street, with them following him.
