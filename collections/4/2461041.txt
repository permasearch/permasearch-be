The chlorarachniophytes form multinucleate cells by fusion, being syncytia and not coenocytes. This syncytia is called plasmodium, in the sense of a multinucleate protoplast without a cell wall which exhibits amoeboid movement.[8] Other examples include some plasmodiophorids, some haplosporidians,[9] and the grex of cellular slime moulds (dictyostelids and acrasids).
