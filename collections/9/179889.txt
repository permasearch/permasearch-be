As Yondu goes to obtain a device that would help repair the Milano, Rocket steps outside and Star-Lord goes to check up on him. As both of them go over what little they understand about the Eternity Forge's capabilities thus far, Rocket reveals that he hopes it can help him with someone he lost. Even though Rocket states he knows that Nebula is the top priority, he tells Star-Lord that they have to stop at Halfworld first so that, if nothing else, he can at least try to use the Eternity Forge. However, Gamora soon after reveals she's found out Nebula (Ashly Burch) has taken Thanos' ship and intends to recover his corpse from whoever the Guardians gave it to - if sold to the Collector, Nebula will be threatening the attendant within his museum for information on Star-Lord, before he and Gamora make their presence known; if sold to the Nova Corps, she will hijack one of their ships and make off with the body on Thanos' vessel, forcing the Milano into a space battle to capture Nebula before the Nova Corps kill her.
