The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation - Assets = Liabilities + Equity. The statement can be used to help show the status of a company.
