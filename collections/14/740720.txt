Hanyu is regarded by analysts as a well-rounded skater, known for his ability to combine strong technique with mature and versatile artistry.[160] The 2006 Olympic silver medalist Stephane Lambiel described him as "the most complete athlete in figure skating, probably ever".[14] Various media outlets and commentators have recognized Hanyu as the greatest skater in history,[14][15][16] particularly after his second Olympic victory, for his consistency in results in a highly competitive field and ability to deliver under pressure.[161][162] His skating techniques include the Biellmann spin and the doughnut spin. Both are known for their difficulty, for male skaters especially, due to the flexibility required.[1][163] Other signature moves include the layback Ina Bauer, hydroblading, and the side lunge.[92]
