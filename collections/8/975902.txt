Eager not to miss Football League fixtures, and not to have a difficult trip again, the club chartered a British European Airways plane from Manchester to Belgrade for the away leg against Red Star.[7] The match was drawn 3â€“3 but it was enough to send United to the semi-finals.[8] The takeoff from Belgrade was delayed for an hour after outside right Johnny Berry lost his passport,[9] and the plane landed in Munich for refuelling at 13:15 GMT.[10][11]
