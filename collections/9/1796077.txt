The Mughal emperor Humayun stopped eating beef after the killing of cows in a Hindu territory by his soldiers led to clashes, according to the Tezkerah al-Vakiat.[94] Later Mughal emperors Jahangir (1605 â€“ 1627), imposed a ban on cattle slaughter for a few years, not out of respect for Hindus, but because cattle had become scarce.[95]
