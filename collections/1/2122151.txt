In 58 AD the consul Publius Suillius Rufus had made a series of public attacks on Seneca.[25] These attacks, reported by Tacitus and Cassius Dio,[26] include charges that in a mere four years of service to Nero, Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million sestertii by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces.[27] Suillius' attacks included claims of sexual corruption, with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina.[28] Tacitus though reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced: he had been a favourite of Claudius,[25] and had been an embezzler and informant.[27] In response Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius: half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile.[29] However the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca which were made at the time and continued through later ages.[25] Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich: he had properties at Baiae and Nomentum, an Alban villa, and Egyptian estates.[25] Dio Cassius even reports that the Boudica uprising in Britannia was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius's conquest of Britain, and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively.[25] Seneca was sensitive to such accusations: his De Vita Beata ("On the Happy Life") dates from around this time and includes a defense of wealth along Stoic lines, arguing that wealth which is properly gained and spent is appropriate behaviour for a philosopher.[27]
