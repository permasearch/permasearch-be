In January 2013, El Superclásico became a topic of diplomatic discussion when the United States Embassy in Buenos Aires; Argentina released a video entitled, Fiebre del Superclásico.[19] In the video, American diplomats from different sections of the Embassy (including the Deputy Chief of Mission and Ambassador) debate the question of "Boca or River?" by trading a series of common jokes and barbs from the Boca–River rivalry. In its first week, the video garnered nearly 50,000 views on YouTube.
