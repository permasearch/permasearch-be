This movie represents the only film soundtrack work by the seminal Los Angeles punk rock band the Germs. They recorded six songs for the film, of which only one, "Lion's Share", appeared. The cut "Shakedown, Breakdown" was written and recorded especially for the film by Toronto cult band Rough Trade.[6]
