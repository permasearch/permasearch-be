In a group of animals (usually a litter of animals born in multiple births), a runt is a member which is smaller or weaker than the others.[1] Owing to its small size, a runt in a litter faces obvious disadvantage, including difficulties in competing with its siblings for survival and possible rejection by its mother. Therefore, in the wild, a runt is less likely to survive infancy.
