The political perspective of the European Union is to make ESA an agency of the EU by 2014.[35] ESA is likely to expand in the coming years with the countries which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007. Currently, almost all EU member states are in different stages of affiliation with ESA. Poland[36] has joined on 19 November 2012. Hungary[37] and Estonia[38] have signed ESA Convention. Latvia and Slovenia have started to implement a Plan for European Cooperating State (PECS) Charter. Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria have signed a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. Cyprus,[39] and Malta have signed Cooperation Agreements with ESA. The only EU member state that has not signed any agreement with ESA is Croatia.
