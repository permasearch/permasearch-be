The song features a prominent riff from well-known harmonica player Delbert McClinton, and drums played by Ray Torres.  Other musicians on the record included Bob Jones and Billy Sanders on Guitar and Jim Rogers on bass. According to a CNN article[2] from 2002, while touring the UK in 1962 with The Beatles, McClinton met John Lennon and gave him some harmonica tips. Lennon put the lessons to use right away on "Love Me Do" and later "Please Please Me". Lennon included the song in his jukebox, and it is also featured on the 2004 related compilation album John Lennon's Jukebox.
