"Liar, Liar" was recorded by Debbie Harry for the soundtrack album Married to the Mob in 1988, and produced by Mike Chapman. It was their first collaboration since the 1982 Blondie album The Hunter. The following year the two would team up again for the album Def, Dumb and Blonde. A music video (co-directed by Adam Bernstein) was produced to promote the single.[1]
