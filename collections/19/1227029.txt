Beachrock units form under a thin cover of sediment and generally overlie unconsolidated sand. They typically consist of multiple units, representing multiple episodes of cementation and exposure. The mineralogy of beachrocks is mainly high-magnesium calcite or aragonite. The main processes involved in the cementation areÂ : supersaturation with CaCO3 through direct evaporation of seawater,[3] groundwater CO2 degassing in the vadose zone,[4] mixing of marine and meteoric water fluxes[5] and precipitation of micritic calcium carbonate as a byproduct of microbiological activity.[6]
