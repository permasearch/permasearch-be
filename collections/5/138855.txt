This is a folk dance from Brij region of Uttar Pradesh. This is done by girls dressed as peacocks, resplendent with peacock feathers and a glittering head-dress complete with a beak. This beak can be opened and closed with the help of a thread tied to it, and manipulated from within dress. This dance is associated with Lord Krishna and Radha. It is considered that when Radharani wanted to see Mayur Nritya, Lord Krishna used to portray himself as a peacock and performs dance like Mayur.
