The game follows both apes and humans with the ape tribe being centred around a family consisting of the tribe leader, Khan and his 3 sons; Bryn, Tola, and Juno. The humans are farmers living off the land in a small village where a town used to stand. They follow Jess, the wife of the former and now deceased town mayor.
