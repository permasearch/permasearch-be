Their 1979 album Cornerstone yielded their first #1 hit, the DeYoung ballad "Babe". By early 1980, "Babe" had become the band's biggest international hit and first million-selling single, reaching #6 in the United Kingdom.[14] The album also included the #26 DeYoung hit "Why Me" and "Borrowed Time", which was co-written with Shaw, plus Shaw's "Boat on the River" (1980), which was a hit in much of Europe and Japan. The popularity of the album (#2 Billboard) helped win the band a People's Choice Award for Best New Song in 1980. At the 22nd Grammy Awards, Styx was a nominee for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group,[15] and Cornerstone's engineers Gary Loizzo and Rob Kingsland were nominated for a Grammy[16] for Best Engineered Recording.
