Ryan Paevey's casting was very well received. The character of Nathan becomes quite popular rather quickly among viewers and critics becoming known as the show's resident heroic "good guy" as he tries to support his mess of a family. At the same time, Nathan's pairing with Maxie becomes a fan favorite pairing and their "slow burn" romance was praised by critics.
