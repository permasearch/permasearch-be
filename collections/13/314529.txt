The third season of The Office was met with critical acclaim. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the third season of the show an 85 out of 100 rating, which translates to the status of "universal acclaim".[16] Travis Fickett of IGN felt that "In its third season The Office continued to be one of the smartest, funniest and most likable shows on television."[17] Entertainment Weekly writer Meeta Agrawal praised the show for separating the action between Jim in Stamford and the rest of the characters in Scranton, a feat that he notes "could have been disastrous" to other shows.[18] Furthermore, he argued that the effort made the audience "appreciate [the characters] even more".[18] Ultimately, he gave the season an "Aâ€“".[18] Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the season "an outstanding year for the Scranton crew" and praised the "unbelievably funny 21 episodes in between" the opener and the finale as reasons as to why it was "a great stand-alone season from easily one of the funniest shows on TV."[19]
