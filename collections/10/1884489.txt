Night of the Demons 2 was released in 1994, with the story picking up six years after the end of the previous film. The story follows the character of Angela's younger sister Melissa as she and several of her fellow students visit Hull House on Halloween. Unlike its predecessor, which took place entirely inside of the funeral parlor, the sequel has demonic activity occurring outside of the limits of the property on the school's campus.
