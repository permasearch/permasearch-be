Frederick M. Smith describes Kamadhenu as a "popular and enduring image in Indian art".[8] All the gods are believed to reside in the body of Kamadhenuâ€”the generic cow. Her four legs are the scriptural Vedas; her horns are the triune gods Brahma (tip), Vishnu (middle) and Shiva (base); her eyes are the sun and moon gods, her shoulders the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu and her legs the Himalayas. Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art.[8][9]
