The output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a vehicle is the product of the traction force of the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in wattsâ€”the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.[1][2]
