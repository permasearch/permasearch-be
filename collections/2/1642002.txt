"Start Me Up" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Charts in September 1981 and remains the last Rolling Stones song to appear in the UK top 10. In Australia, the song reached number one in November 1981. In the US, "Start Me Up" spent three weeks at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in October and November 1981.[4] It also spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard Top Tracks chart.[5] This set a record for most weeks at #1 that was not broken until 1994, when Stone Temple Pilots' "Interstate Love Song" spent 15 weeks on top. The B-side is a slow blues number called "No Use in Crying", which is also included on Tattoo You.
