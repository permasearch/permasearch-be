I think its important to show photos that emphasize TR's vigorous and bellicose nature because they went into the making who he was. Also added photos to TR's first wife, Alice and his first daughter, Alice. Added pages with photos of both Roosevel's mother, Martha (Mittie) Bulloch Roosevelt and his father Theodore, Sr. Please continue to edit for clarity and content.
