During the 2007-2008 school year a student who was being questioned by officers about passing counterfeit bills to a local merchant led police to a gun and one ounce of marijuana hidden above ceiling tiles in one of the school's locker rooms. He also led authorities to a home in the area where they found manufacturing equipment to make the counterfeit money. Three other students were investigated for possession of counterfeit money.[7]
