The team pursuit is the only team event in top-level long track speed skating and is skated by teams of three skaters. Races resemble the team pursuit event in track cycling.[20] Two teams race at a time, starting at a line in the middle of the straightaway. One team starts on each side of the track. Only the inner lane is used. The distance is eight laps for men and six for women. The team's time is the third skater to cross the finish line.
