Due to the long, tedious process of analyzing proteins, peptide mass fingerprinting was developed. Edman degradation was used in protein analysis, and it required almost an hour to analyze one amino acid residue.[9] SDS-PAGE was also used to separate proteins in very complex mixtures, which also employed methods of electroblotting and staining.[10] Then, bands would be extracted from the gel and sequenced, automatically. A recurring problem in the process was that interfering proteins would also purify with the protein of interest. The sequences of these interfering proteins were compiled into what came to known as the Dayhoff database.[11] Ultimately, having the sequences of these known protein contaminants in databases decreased instrument time and expenses involved in protein analysis.
