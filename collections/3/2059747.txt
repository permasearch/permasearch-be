An additional scene of the film presents a medium close-up of the leader of the bandits, played by Justus D. Barnes, who empties his pistol point-blank directly into the camera. The scene is not directly related to anything in the main narrative, and is described as "Realism" by the accompanying letter from Edison Manufacturing.[7] Although it is usually placed at the end, Porter stated that the scene could also appear at the beginning of the film.[8]
