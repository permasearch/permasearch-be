Peseros are typically half-length passenger buses (known as microbús) that sit 22 passengers and stand up to 28. As of 2007[update], the approximately 28,000 peseros carried up to 60 percent of the city's passengers.[103][104] In August 2016, Mayor Mancera announced that new pesero vehicle and concessions would be eliminated completely unless they were ecologically friendly vehicles,[105] and in October 2011 the city's Secretary of Mobility Héctor Serrano states that by the end of the current administration (2018) there would no longer by any peseros/microbuses circulating at all, and that new full-sized buses would take over the routes.[106]
