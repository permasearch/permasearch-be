People in the villages where (WFSS) operates become partners in the process of making safe, drinkable water available there. Villagers provide sweat equity labor, and village elders help determine a wellâ€™s location and appoint one of their people to maintain the completed well and its pump. The WFSS team trains the well manager and provides spare parts.[4]
