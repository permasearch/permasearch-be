Trevor appears as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online, the online multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto V. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13; after the player steals Trevor's rolling meth lab,[34] Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue.[35] The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing drugs from rival groups, specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club, while killing the dealers.[36] The narrative of Grand Theft Auto Online is set several months prior to the events of the single-player story.[37]
