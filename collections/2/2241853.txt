The Nakamura number of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection. Nakamura's theorem states that the core     C ( v , p )   {\displaystyle C(v,p)}   is nonempty for all profiles     p   {\displaystyle p}   of acyclic (alternatively, transitive) preferences if and only if     X   {\displaystyle X}   is finite and the cardinal number (the number of elements) of     X   {\displaystyle X}   is less than the Nakamura number of     v   {\displaystyle v}  . A variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core     C ( v , p )   {\displaystyle C(v,p)}   is nonempty for all profiles     p   {\displaystyle p}   of preferences that have a maximal element if and only if the cardinal number of     X   {\displaystyle X}   is less than the Nakamura number of     v   {\displaystyle v}  .
