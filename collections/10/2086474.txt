Boise State is the mid-major program to qualify for the most major bowl games; it has done so thrice, twice while in the WAC and once in the Mountain West. TCU and Utah each did it twice; both are now members of "Power Five Conferences": TCU is now in the Big 12 and qualified for the 2014 Peach Bowl while there, whereas Utah is currently in the Pac-12.
