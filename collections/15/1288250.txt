The Freelander 2, sold as the LR2 in North America, was introduced in 2006 during Ford's ownership of Land Rover.[11] The second generation Freelander was built on the Ford EUCD platform, using a Ford Duratorq four cylinder diesel engine, and initially the Volvo B6324S six cylinder petrol engine.[11] The six cylinder petrol engine was replaced for the 2013 model year by a more economical Ford EcoBoost four cylinder 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine. The Ford petrol and diesel four cylinder engines were carried over for the Discovery Sport's first model year.
