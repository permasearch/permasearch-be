The opening theme, "I'm in Between", was written for the show by series composer, Jared Faber, and Emily Kapnek.[29] The song was first recorded with vocals by Melissa Disney, in character as Ginger. But this version was replaced before initial North American broadcasts with another version performed by Cree Summer. This would be used for half of the first season before a third version, featuring vocals by R&B artist Macy Gray,[2] which was used for the rest of the series' run.
