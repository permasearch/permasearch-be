Mela Ramnagariya is organized every year during the Hindu month of Magh, which lasts from mid-January to mid-February. It involves bathing at river Ganga. It commences on the day of Makar Sankranti in January, which is the first important bathing day.  A large number of people arrive here annually and stay in makeshift houses or tents at Panchal Ghat (Ghatiya Ghat), spending the entire month of Magh in prayers. Every year during this period massive arrangements are made by the District Administration and Social Organizations for the devotees coming to Magh Mela. This include establishment of a temporary tented township, roads, transport services, water supply, electricity and sanitation facilities, medical and policing.
