The game follows the series' standard open world gameplay in the Ezio and Altaïr Sequences, where the game's main story takes place. New gameplay additions include an item called the "hookblade", which can be used to zipline across the city or grab enemies to yank them in for a combo attack. The hookblade reportedly speeds up navigation by around 30 percent and serves as a replacement to the traditional dual Hidden Blade.[3] Along with the hookblade, Ezio also has around 15 different bomb variations at his disposal, which are to be crafted.[4] The game features new Desmond Sequences known as "Desmond's Journey", five "Dalí-esque" first-person platforming missions in a radical departure for the series.[5] Each sequences of "Desmond's Journey" can only be unlocked by collecting a certain amount of Data Fragments hidden throughout Constantinople, or by purchasing The Lost Archive DLC. Data Fragments are a new type of collectible in Revelations, replacing the flags of previous games in the series.
