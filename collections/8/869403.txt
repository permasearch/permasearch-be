Reception of the soundtrack was generally positive from critics. IGN praised the soundtrack for its wide use of instruments stating, "Where other videogame scores tend to miss their mark when combining electronic and organic elements, O'Donnell and Salvatori seem to have found a rather stable balance between the two divergent sounds." Adding, overall, the soundtrack is "one of the better videogame oriented musical experiences out there" and playing the game is not required to find enjoyment within the score.[7] Reviewing for Monsters At Play, Michael Johnson called the soundtrack "66 minutes of orchestral goodness" citing the wide range of music covered as a strong point.[8] Nuketown gave the soundtrack 9 out of 10, stating, "the soundtrack is a welcome and invigorating reminder of good times had blasting unstoppable alien hordes".[9] The release went on to sell over 40,000 copies.[10]
