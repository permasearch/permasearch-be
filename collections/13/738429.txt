Agent Johnson puts the Coopers in charge of collecting information on Brady. K.C. arranges a job interview for Marisa to become a junior agent-in-training for The Organization, which leads Marisa to question Brady, who had already told her that she was a junior agent. After being questioned, Brady eventually reveals to Marisa that he is a member of The Alternate. Brady also reveals that he has hours of audio footage in which Marisa states that K.C. may have become a rogue agent and agrees to work with him to take her down. Brady blackmails Marisa to continue spying on K.C., or else he will release the audio footage and get her imprisoned for treason against the United States. Marisa confesses to K.C. that she has been spying for Brady, and K.C. discovers that Marisa's necklace was never bugged. When unusual weather begins occurring around the world, the Coopers realize that the Storm Maker has been activated, so they instruct Marisa to gain information from Brady about the device. When Marisa fails, K.C. goes in disguise as Marisa and confronts Brady, who kidnaps and takes her to The Alternate's headquarters, as she planned. Meanwhile, Ernie wants to drive by Monique's house in his father's 1969 classic muscle car, but he crashes it before getting out of the driveway, scraping away the paint on one of the doors. Judy makes the situation worse by repainting the door a different color and then removing the paint entirely. Ernie and Judy blame the damage on The Alternate, but Craig does not believe them.
