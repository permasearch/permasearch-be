Most books that are adjacent to each other in chronological order take place within a generation or so of each other (as evidenced by mentions of past characters in the later books), and, in the cases of Redwall and Mattimeo, and of Mariel of Redwall and The Bellmaker, feature the same cast with a short span of time between them.[2]
