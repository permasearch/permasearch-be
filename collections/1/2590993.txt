Kemp's ankle injury took a lot longer to heal than had been expected, and the team reported that they hoped to get him back in September.[95][96][97] However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back.[98] He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.[99]
