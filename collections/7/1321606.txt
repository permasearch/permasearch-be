During a moment of levity, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) affectionately places his hand on Pam's knee. After an awkward silence, Toby proclaims that he is moving to Costa Rica; he then hops the parking lot fence and runs away.  The cleaning staff arrives and lets the group out (with help from Oscar, who speaks Spanish).
