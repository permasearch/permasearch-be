The western continental coast of the U.S., just as the East Coast, varies from a colder-to-warmer climate from north to south. Few species live through-out the entire West Coast, however, there are some, including the American Bald Eagle that inhabits both the Alaskan Aleutian Islands and the California Channel Islands. In most of the contiguous Western U.S. are mule deer, white-tailed antelope squirrels, cougars, American badgers, coyotes, hawks and several species of snakes and lizards are common.
