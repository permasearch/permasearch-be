According to Lister in "Ouroboros" (1997), Kryten ended up alone aboard the Nova 5 because he killed the crew in an accident, and prior to that on the SS Augustus, that ship's crew had all died of old age. In the episode, a Kryten from a parallel dimension (played by Llewellyn) is briefly seen, when a "linkway" through "non-space" is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses.[15]
