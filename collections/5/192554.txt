Trevorrow and Connolly began work on the script and devised the basic story during a road trip that they took in June 2015, immediately after the release of Jurassic World.[63][64] Having directed Jurassic World, Trevorrow became familiar with how animatronics worked and wrote scenes into the sequel in a way that would allow for their use, as animatronics are incapable of certain actions such as running.[65] In September 2015, Trevorrow said the film's story was inspired by a quote from Dr. Alan Grant in the first film: "Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have suddenly been thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect?"[66] After Bayona was hired, he began reading all of Michael Crichton's novels—including Jurassic Park and its sequel, The Lost World—for inspiration and "to try to immerse myself in Crichton's mind."[67][68]
