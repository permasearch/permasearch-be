The simplest microfilm camera that is still in use is a rail mounted structure at the top of which is a bellows camera for 105 x 148Â mm film. A frame or copy board holds the original drawing vertical. The camera has a horizontal axis which passes through the center of the copy. The structure may be moved horizontally on rails.
