When a real estate appraiser works with a business valuation appraiser (and perhaps an equipment and machinery appraiser)[8] to provide a value of the combination of a business and the real estate used for that business, the specific market value is called "going concern value". It recognizes that the combined market value may be different from the sum of the separate values: "The market value of all the tangible and intangible assets of an established operating business with an indefinite life, as if sold in aggregate."[9]
