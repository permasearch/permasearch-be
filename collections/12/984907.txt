The guys prepare for Star Wars Day and plan to watch all six films. Leonard tells Sheldon that Arthur Jeffries (Professor Proton), their childhood hero, has died. While Sheldon claims he is fine and prepares to start the film marathon with Raj and Howard, Penny and Leonard attend Jeffries' funeral on the same day and start discussing their regrets in life; he regrets not having accepted her marriage proposal. As Leonard is more upset about her turning his two proposals down than him turning her one down, Penny proposes to make him feel better. He chooses to tease her in hesitating to answer, frustrating her. While Sheldon is sleeping through the film marathon, Jeffries appears to him dressed as a Jedi Master. He knows neither why he is there nor what advice to give Sheldon, but once Sheldon confides that all his male idols in his family died, he tells him to cherish the people around him in the present. After Leonard returns home, Sheldon wakes up and hugs him, taking Arthur's advice. Bernadette and Amy make a Death Star cake for the guys while talking about why they became scientists. Finally, Sheldon has another dream where Arthur asks him if watching Star Wars is a useful way to spend his life and Sheldon sees nothing wrong in it.
