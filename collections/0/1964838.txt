Since Cartman's house is being fumigated and Butters insists they cannot go to his house, they go to Chef's instead to watch on his new plasma screen TV. To their disappointment, the trailer is not shown during the break – and to make matters worse, Chef's confused fumbling with the remote causes the TV to transform into an ED-209-like robot. The TV wreaks havoc on the street, and throughout the remainder of the episode, Chef follows the destructive television around South Park, while talking to customer service on his cellphone in an effort to deprogram the machine. The boys go to watch TV at the local bar, only to be kicked out for being underage. They arrive at the Retirement Community where they manage to catch another commercial break, but the trailer is once again not aired. The elderly grow annoyed with the boys and force them out by simultaneously releasing their bowels.
