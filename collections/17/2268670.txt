Periodically, the corporation lowers the water level in the lake by opening the dam to enable lakefront property owners to conduct repairs on docks and boathouses.[36] In September 2010, the lake was drawn down approximately 24 feet (7.3Â m) to allow replacement of an aging sewer pipe that traverses the lake, the lowest lake level since 1962 when the original sewer line was installed. The lake was refilled to its usual level in the summer of 2011.[37][38] In recent years, the lake has experienced explosive algae growth in the lake, due in part to runoff from lawn fertilizer, which is rich in phosphorus.[22]
