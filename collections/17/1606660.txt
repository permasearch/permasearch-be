The peaks of Mount Kenya are almost all of a volcanic origin. The majority of the peaks are located near the centre of the mountain. These peaks have an Alpine appearance due to their craggy nature. Typically of Alpine terrain, the highest peaks and gendarmes occur at the intersection of ridges.[7] The central peaks only have a few mosses, lichens and small alpine plants growing in rock crevices.[10] Further away from the central peaks, the volcanic plugs are covered in volcanic ash and soils.[23] The vegetation growing on these peaks is typical for their vegetation band.
