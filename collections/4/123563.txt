Hunting is not permitted, though it is allowed in the surrounding national forests during open season. Fishing is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters.[132] Many park waters are fly fishing only and all native fish species are catch and release only.[133] Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 miles (8.0Â km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lake, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination.[134]
