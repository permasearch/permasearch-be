Jolee Bindo, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, is a character in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Jolee is an old hermit living on Kashyyyk and a former Jedi Padawan. Bindo helped Revan get past shield generators that lead deeper into the shadowlands and remained with Revan's party. After the main character gains experience, Jolee will tell of how he was once a smuggler, and through this met his wife. Against the wishes of the Jedi Council he trained her in the Jedi ways. She was then seduced to the dark side by Exar Kun, upon failing to convince Jolee to join Exar Kun as well, she drew her lightsaber on him. Jolee won the fight, but he was unable to bring himself to kill her. She escaped and went on to kill many Jedi. Jolee expected to be punished harshly for his mistakes, but the Council said he had learned his lessons the hard way, and even considered promoting him to knighthood. Disappointed with the Jediâ€™s decision, Jolee left the Order and started wandering the galaxy before being stranded on Kashyyyk, where he meets the player character.
