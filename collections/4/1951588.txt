Recording sessions for the album took place over two weeks in May 2017 and left Sia and Kurstin "laughing at the end of each day". In September, Kurstin said of working on the album with Sia: "I don't know how she comes up with song lyric and melody ideas so quickly. ... [S]he wrote these new Christmas stories. ... I'm still sort of new at this Christmas thing. ... [It] took me back to when we used to get into jazz chord changes. There's some really fun uptempo Christmas jams, and then there's also some Sia ballads."[6]
