SS2PL mentioned above is a variant (special case) of CO and thus also effective to achieve distributed and global serializability. It also provides automatic distributed deadlock resolution (a fact overlooked in the research literature even after CO's publication), as well as Strictness and thus Recoverability. Possessing these desired properties together with known efficient locking based implementations explains SS2PL's popularity. SS2PL has been utilized to efficiently achieve Distributed and Global serializability since the 1980, and has become the de facto standard for it. However, SS2PL is blocking and constraining (pessimistic), and with the proliferation of distribution and utilization of systems different from traditional database systems (e.g., as in Cloud computing), less constraining types of CO (e.g., Optimistic CO) may be needed for better performance.
