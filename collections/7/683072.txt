In the series finale, "iGoodbye", Sam and Carly take a break from their web show while Carly moves to Italy. Sam then became a lead character in the spin-off series Sam & Cat, in which she moves to Los Angeles and becomes friends with Cat Valentine (a character originally from Victorious) after rescuing her from a garbage truck.
