By 2006, affirmative responses to the question "Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?" had increased considerably, with 72% of Canadians (and 64% of anglophones) agreeing. 70% of Canadians, and 64% of anglophones were "in favour of bilingualism for [their] province".[24] Support for bilingualism is thought likely to continue to increase, as young anglophones are more favourable to it than their elders.[24]
