By the early 16th century, the Janissaries were equipped with and were skilled with muskets.[31] In particular, they used a massive "trench gun", firing an 80-millimetre (3.1 in) ball,[citation needed] which was "feared by their enemies".[31] Janissaries also made extensive use of early grenades and hand cannons, such as the abus gun.[19] Pistols were not initially popular but they became so after the Cretan War (1645–1669).[32]
