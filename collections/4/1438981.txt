The Browns ultimately finished the season with a 10â€“6 record but nevertheless failed to qualify for the playoffs. They were beaten for the division title on a tiebreaker by the Pittsburgh Steelers and lost another tiebreaker for a wildcard berth to the Tennessee Titans. As of the 2017 NFL season, this remains the best record and the last winning season the Browns have had since returning to the NFL in 1999.
