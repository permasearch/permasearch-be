The fruit is a small drupe 1–2.5 cm (0.39–0.98 in) long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage.[10] Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened[11] (see below on processing) and may contain the chemical ferrous gluconate to improve the appearance.[12] Olea europaea contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a pit or a rock, and in British English as a stone.[13]
