On the final day of the regular season, the Spartans travelled to New Jersey to take on Rutgers, the team against which MSU tallied its lone conference win from the prior year. MSU started fast scoring on their first possession as Brian Lewerke hit Connor Heyward from seven yards out for the early 7–0 lead. On the ensuing Rutgers possession, MSU forced a fumble on the first play which was recovered by Andrew Dowell at the Rugers eight yard line. The Spartans were unable to get into the end zone, however, and settled for a Matt Coghlin 26-yard field goal. Following a Scarlet Knight punt, MSU again moved deep into Rutgers territory, but again could not punch the ball in and settled for another 26-yard field goal and a 13–0 lead. Rutgers answered on their next possession early in the second quarter on a 42-yard touchdown pass to pull within 13–7. The Spartans were able to add another Coghlin field goal to take a 16–7 lead at the half.
