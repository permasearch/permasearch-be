The feature began again in The Independent on 4 August 2005 with a "Sunday 31 July" entry. A book containing all of the original columns was given away with the paper the following Saturday. This relaunch of the column is also printed in the Irish Independent. The International Herald Tribune reviewed the new column rather favourably, commenting that Fielding's satire was in good form.[3] The Daily Mail reviewed it less favourably, saying it lacked the genuine quality of the first two novels.[14]
