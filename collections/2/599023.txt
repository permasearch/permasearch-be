Polemically, the veto message was "a brilliant political manifesto"[149] that called for the end of monied power in the financial sector and a leveling of opportunity under the protection of the executive branch.[150] Jackson perfected his anti-Bank themes, pitting the idealized "plain republican" and the "real people" – virtuous, industrious and free[151][152] - against a powerful financial institution – the "monster" Bank[153] whose wealth was purportedly derived from privileges bestowed by corrupt political and business elites.[154][49] To those who believed that power and wealth should be linked, the message was unsettling. Daniel Webster charged Jackson with promoting class warfare.[155][147][156] Webster was at around this time annually pocketing a small salary for his "services" in defending the Bank.[157]
