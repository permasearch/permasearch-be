Sexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be an subtle and overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance), implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the workplace, schools, and the military. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable. Women are substantially more likely to be affected than men.[22][23] The main focus of groups working against sexual harassment has been the protection of women, but in recent years awareness has grown of the need to protect LGBTQ, men and transgender people also.[24][additional citation(s) needed]
