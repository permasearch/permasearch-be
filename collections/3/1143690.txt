where     j   {\displaystyle j}   represents the imaginary unit,      s  a   ( t )   {\displaystyle s_{a}(t)}   is the analytic representation of     s ( t ) ,   {\displaystyle s(t),}   and      s  a   ∗   ( t )   {\displaystyle s_{a}^{*}(t)}   is its complex conjugate.  This representation divides     s ( t )   {\displaystyle s(t)}   into its non-negative frequency components and its non-positive frequency components.  In other words:
