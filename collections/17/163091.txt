Unfortunately for its inhabitants, the site at Richmond where Virginia's first penitentiary was built bordered a stagnant pool, in which sewage collected.[168] The prison's cells had no heating system and water oozed from its walls, leading inmates' extremities to freeze during the winter months.[168] Prisoners could perform no work during the solitary portion of their sentence, which they served completely isolated in near-total darkness, and many went mad during this portion of their sentence.[168] Those prisoners who survived the isolation period joined other inmates in the prison workshop to make goods for the state militia.[168] The workshop never turned a profit.[168] Escapes were common.[169]
