Soy milk (also spelled soymilk) is a plant-based drink produced by soaking dried soybeans, grinding them in water, boiling the mixture, and filtering out the residues. A traditional staple of East Asian cuisine, soy milk is a stable emulsion of oil, water and protein. Soy milk can be produced at home using a soy milk machine. A number of commercially-prepared brands are sold in pre-packaged bottles and tetra packs. It is often used as a substitute for dairy milk for individuals who are vegan or lactose intolerant.[2]
