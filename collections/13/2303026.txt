Nichols married film producer Scott Stuber on July 26, 2008, in Aspen, Colorado. Nichols allowed her hair to return to its natural blond color for the ceremony, as it had been dyed red for her consecutive roles in Star Trek and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.[3] They were working on building a home in Cabo San Lucas shortly after their honeymoon.[3] Seven months later, in February 2009, Nichols and Stuber separated due to irreconcilable differences.[65]
