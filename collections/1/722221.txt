The 108th Congress (2003–2005) saw the Senate return to a GOP majority of 51–49, as Republican President George W Bush had gained popularity for his fight against Al Qaeda terrorists and broad tax cuts.[132] In 2006, opposition to Bush's continuation of the Iraq War had grown to new heights.[133] As a result, the 110th Congress saw the Democrats regain majority control of both the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives.[133] This shifted again; in 2010, after two years of a sour economy with high unemployment, Republicans regained control of the House, although Democrats kept control in the Senate; exit polls suggested voters were dissatisfied with President Obama as well as the Congress.[134][135]
