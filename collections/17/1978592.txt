Yojimbo is itself believed to have been based on Dashiell Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest,[10][12] with Kurosawa scholar David Desser and film critic Manny Farber, among others, stating categorically that this is the case.[13] Leone himself clearly believed this theory, saying that "Kurosawa's Yojimbo was inspired by an American novel of the sÃ©rie noire so I was really taking the story back home again."[14]
