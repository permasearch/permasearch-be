"Straight to Hell" was written and recorded towards the very end of The Clash's New York recording sessions for the Combat Rock album. Mick Jones' guitar technician Digby Cleaver describes the sessions as "a mad, creative rush" that occurred on 30 December 1981, the day before The Clash was due to fly out of New York on New Year's Eve 1981.[1]
