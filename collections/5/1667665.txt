I was little girl when my father, Bill McCain was News Director at WAGA. Jim Bailey was the station Manager. As I recall, William was the name of the Janitor/guy Friday, errand runner. I used to ride around in the station's station wagon with him when he did errands. As I recall the dog "WAGA" was a black Scotty, not a Yorkshire terrier. Jon Farmer and his wife Phyllis were good family friends. They also had a ballroom dance show together (as I recall) that ran on Saturday evenings.. Source is myself..
