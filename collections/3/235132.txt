"Interpersonality amnesia" was removed as a diagnostic feature from the DSM III in 1987, which may have contributed to the increasing frequency of the diagnosis.[11] There were 200 reported cases of DID as of 1980, and 20,000 from 1980 to 1990.[97] Joan Acocella reports that 40,000 cases were diagnosed from 1985 to 1995.[98] Scientific publications regarding DID peaked in the mid-1990s then rapidly declined.[99]
