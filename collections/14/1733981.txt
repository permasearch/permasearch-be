According to Chinese sources, the melons were introduced to China by American horticulturalist Henry A. Wallace, who donated melon seeds to the locals while visiting in the 1940s (probably 1944).[5] Wallace, who served as Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, and Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt, had founded a major seed company (Pioneer Hi-Bred) and otherwise had a general background and interest in agricultural pursuits. As a result, in China the melon is sometimes called the Wallace (Chinese: 华莱士; pinyin: Hualaishi).[6] The Mizo people of Asia use the name Hmazil.
