In Taiwan, 7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain and is owned by President Chain Store Corporation under Uni-President Enterprises Corporation. The first fourteen stores opened in 1979, and struggled to make a profit. Southland Corporation partnered with Uni-President to modernize the stores. However, business was still slow, and Uni-President opted to stock Asian foods. In 1986, 7-Eleven made its first profit in Taiwan.[55] The 5,000th store was opened in July 2014.[56] In January 2018, an experimental and unstaffed shop branded the X-Store was opened.[57] There are 5,221 stores currently in Taiwan.
