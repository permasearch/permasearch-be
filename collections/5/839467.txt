At some point after departure from Tortuga, the Black Pearl was attacked by the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Using the powers of Triton's Sword (able to control any ship and its inner workings), Blackbeard brought the rigging of the Black Pearl to life, and used it against Barbossa and his crew. Barbossa's men were defeated and the Black Pearl captured, shrunk and put in a bottle by Blackbeard. Barbossa was allegedly the only survivor as he was apparently hanging by one leg, being forced to cut it off in order to set himself free, but it was later revealed that other members of the crew had managed to escape, although Jack the monkey was trapped on the ship.
