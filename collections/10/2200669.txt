Grand Falls-Windsor has a humid continental climate, its classification being similar to the remainder of Newfoundland. Due to its farther inland position than most localities the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and its moderation is less prevalent, rendering the warmest summers on the island. Winter lows are also more extreme than in St. John's and Corner Brook, although swings are very moderate when compared to areas on similar latitudes in continental Canada.
