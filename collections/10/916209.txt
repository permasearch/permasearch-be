The German and the Soviet armies used horses until the end of the war for transportation of troops and supplies. The German Army, strapped for motorised transport because its factories were needed to produce tanks and aircraft, used around 2.75 million horsesâ€”more than it had used in World War I.[195] One German infantry division in Normandy in 1944 had 5,000 horses.[163] The Soviets used 3.5 million horses.[195]
