This article lists longest passenger rail services that are currently scheduled and running directly between two cities. This list is not complete due to the complexity of various railway systems, its timetables and difference in schedule administration between countries. To keep the list simple, only services that are point-to-point direct between two cities are listed. Services that require railcar exchanges, coach changes, shunting or station transfers are not listed.
