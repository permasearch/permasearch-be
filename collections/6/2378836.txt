"Music" was later added to the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004.[114] Set to a slower, hip-hop inspired remix, the performance featured Madonna and her dancers wearing Scottish kilts and a lighted staircase surrounding a DJ Station. At the end, Madonna and her dancers lifted up their kilts to spell the word "FREEDOM", with glitter letters on their underpants. MTV's Corey Moss opined that during the performance "Madonna and her dancers transformed the arena into a steamy nightclub".[115] The next year, the singer performed "Music" at the Live 8 benefit concert in London.[116] On the 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna performed "Music Inferno", a mashup of "Music" and The Trammps's "Disco Inferno". It began with several dancers on roller skates emerging from beneath the stage to perform "Xanadu-worthy tricks", while the stage was bathed in deep red lights.[117] Madonna appeared wearing a white suit and performed the track.[118] Halfway through the performance, Madonna walked to the center stage where, according to MTV's Corey Moss, she did "her best Saturday Night Fever-era John Travolta routine, complete with the 'hitchhike' (you know, thumbs to the side)".[119] The performance of the song at the August 15â€“16, 2006 shows in London, at the Wembley Arena, were recorded and included on Madonna's second live album, The Confessions Tour (2007).[120]
