The Dodgers featured an infield of Steve Garvey at first, Davey Lopes at second, Ron Cey at third, and Bill Russell at shortstop, in addition to slugger Reggie Smith, and pitching duo (Don Sutton and Tommy John). In addition to Jackson and Munson, the Yankees had Bucky Dent and Graig Nettles, Cy Young Award-winning closer Sparky Lyle, young pitcher Ron Guidry, and speedsters Willie Randolph and Mickey Rivers. The Dodgers appeared primed to win the Series, but Reggie Jackson put on his "Mr. October" show as he hit three home runs in Game 6 off of 3 pitches to lead the Yanks to their first World Series championship since 1962.
