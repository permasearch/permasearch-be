After finding a clue at Rudy's house, Dexter arrives at the house of his mother, Laura Moser. Flashbacks reveal that Rudy, whose real name is Brian Moser, is in fact Dexter's biological brother. He also witnessed the murder of their mother, but did not repress the memory; instead, he grew up in a mental institution being treated for antisocial personality disorder. Dexter meets Brian in their childhood home, where he is keeping Debra. He intends to kill Debra with Dexter as a sort of "family reunion", but Dexter stops him. As Doakes and the rest of the homicide unit close in on the house, Brian escapes through a trap door and Dexter is left with Debra, appearing to have saved her.
