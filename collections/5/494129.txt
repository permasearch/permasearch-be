Due to their experimentation during the mid-1960s, the band had developed an eclectic approach to arrangements. Slide guitar playing is prominent (played entirely by Richards, except "Country Honk", which was performed by Mick Taylor), and is featured on all songs except "Gimme Shelter", "Live With Me" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want", giving the album an authentic blues feel throughout. In addition, an array of session musicians embellish the songs with various instruments. Alongside the de rigueur piano performances (Ian Stewart, Nicky Hopkins), the record included fiddle (Byron Berline),[8] mandolin (Ry Cooder),[14] organ and French horn (Al Kooper),[15] as well as vibes (Bill Wyman)[16] and autoharp (Wyman,[17] Jones[18]). Of more importance, however, was the debut of both renowned saxophonist Bobby Keys on "Live With Me", a musician who was integral at giving the group's arrangements a soul/jazz background, and guitarist Mick Taylor, who took on lead guitar duties with technically proficient playing, giving the band a harder rock sound during the late 1960s/early 1970s.[19]
