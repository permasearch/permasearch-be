After being punished with no more television for ruining both his parents' jobs by using elements from a violent television show called "Maho Mushi", Timmy has had enough of tolerating his torturing babysitter Vicky. He wishes up for a magical remote that allows him to enter inside television shows; unfortunately, however, the remote falls into Vicky's hands. With the remote, Vicky plans to enter the biographical channel which is featuring "Dictator Week" so she can become a world dictator. Timmy wishes up for another magical remote, and enters inside television in order to stop Vicky's plans. Meanwhile, Timmy's parents Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who dismiss their son's concerns of Vicky every time, refuse to believe that Vicky is most certainly an evil babysitter, until a fateful day when they receive information proving otherwise from Vicky's younger sister, Tootie.
