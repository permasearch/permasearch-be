In 1965, Ford produced Holman and Moody-built fiberglass-bodied Mustangs for (among others) "Gas" Ronda, who was the most successful Ford racer.  In 1966, Mercury offered a revolutionary flopper-bodied Comet, as exemplified by Don Nicholson's Eliminator I, which clocked a 7.98 at Detroit Dragway in its debut season, the quickest of the fuel injected cars.[61] The car was built by Logghe Bros. (based in Detroit[62]) (with bodies by Fiberglass Trends), weighing in around 1,700 lb (770 kg), making it heavier than most contemporary top fuel dragsters.[63] (It would be the first Funny Car on the cover of Hot Rod, in April 1966.[64])  Similar cars went to Chrisman, "Fast Eddie" Schartman, and Kenz and Leslie.[65]  These cars had the first coilover suspension in funny car, and were powered by Hilborn-injected 427 SOHCs producing 1,000 hp (750 kW) on 80% nitro.[66]  (Chrisman's was the oddity, a roadster running a 6-71 GMC supercharger.[67]) They were capable of mid-seven second e.t.s at around 185 mph (298 km/h).[68] Schartman (working with Roy Steffey, on the "Flip-Top Fueller") would beat Chrisman for Top Funny Car at the NHRA World Finals in 1966 at Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a pass of 8.28 at 174.41 mph (280.69 km/h).[69]  Nicholson would fit a Pete Robinson-built Top Fuel 427 SOHC early in the 1967 season and turn 7.90s at around 180 mph (290 km/h), earning an eighty-six percent winning record.[70]  (The success of the Top Fuel-engined Comets would eventually prompt both Ford and Chrysler to drop funny car sponsorship.)[71]  In 1967, Doug Thorley would record the first (unofficial) 200 mph (320 km/h) funny car pass in his Corvair at Lions.[72]
