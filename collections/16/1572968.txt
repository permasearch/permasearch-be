While Dylan was dismissive of the Beatles' landmark album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967),[15][16] Harrison remained an avowed fan of Dylan's work – Blonde on Blonde being the only Western music that Harrison took with him to India in February 1968.[17][nb 1] Following the sessions for the Beatles' White Album, Harrison worked in Los Angeles for much of October and November 1968,[23] producing the debut solo album by Jackie Lomax,[24] one of the first signings to the Beatles' Apple record label.[25] Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, then spent Thanksgiving with the Dylans[26] while staying in the Catskills as guests of manager Albert Grossman.[27][28] Despite Dylan's excitement at their arrival,[29] Harrison found him withdrawn and seemingly lacking in confidence.[30][nb 2] Music journalist John Harris notes that, unlike in their previous meetings, "there were no hangers-on [this time], Dylan's head was clear, and the protective barriers of cool could come down – which, eventually, they did."[32] On the third day, Harrison recalls in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, "we got the guitars out and then things loosened up".[26]
