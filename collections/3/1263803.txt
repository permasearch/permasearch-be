Originally titled Soul Sucka,[13] the album was later changed to Scream. The album is the only one to feature guitarist Gus G, who replaced long-term guitarist Zakk Wylde.[14] The drums on the album were recorded by Kevin Churko, though Tommy Clufetos was credited, as he was touring with the band at the time.[15] Scream is also the first release to feature keyboardist Adam Wakeman, who has worked with Osbourne as a touring musician since 2004. The lead single released from the album was "Let Me Hear You Scream", which peaked at number 6 on the American Rock Songs chart.[16] It is also his first since 1986's The Ultimate Sin to use his classic logo.
