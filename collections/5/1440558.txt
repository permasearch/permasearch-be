The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself, her image (in portrait or effigy) thus being used to signify government authority.[16] A royal cypher or crown may also illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, without referring to any specific monarch. Further, though the monarch does not form a part of the constitutions of Ontario's honours, they do stem from the Crown as the fount of honour, and so bear on the insignia symbols of the sovereign.
