Claire, Tess, and baby Charlotte are returning from town with party supplies when their Ute hit a pothole and Claire loses control of the vehicle, and coming to a stop with its front wheels dangling off the edge of a cliff. Tess is able to get out and get Charlotte to safety, but cannot get Claire's door open before the Ute starts to slide. It goes over the cliff and into a canyon, killing Claire.
