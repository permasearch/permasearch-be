The Board will suspend the processing of an election petition if a “blocking charge” is filed, that is an unfair labor practice charge that, on its face, alleges unlawful conduct that, if true, might interfere with employees’ ability to make a free and uncoerced choice of representative, reflecting the fundamental rights defined in NLRA section 7.[1] The Region investigates these charges on an expedited basis, the Regional Director may make a preliminary decision as to whether the charge has merit and, if it does, is likely to affect the election. The Regional Director’s decision to block or not block an election is not appealable.
