On 11 April 2011, the pressure group Activists for Change (A4C) held its first Walk to Work protest near Kampala, in response to a comment by President Museveni on the increased cost of fuel, which had risen by 50 percent between January and April 2011. He said: "What I call on the public to do is to use fuel sparingly. Don't drive to bars."[23][24] The protest, which called on workers to walk to work to highlight the increased cost of transport in Uganda,[23] was disrupted by police, who fired tear gas and arrested three-time presidential candidate Kizza Besigye and Democratic Party leader Norbert Mao.[25] In the course of the protest, Besigye was shot in the right arm by a rubber bullet. The government blamed the violence on protesters.[24]
