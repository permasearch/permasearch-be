Islam is the fastest growing religious confession in the UK and its adherents have the lowest average age out of all the major religious groups.[7] Between 2001 and 2009 the Muslim population increased almost 10 times faster than the non-Muslim population.[8] The majority of Muslims in United Kingdom belong to the Sunni denomination,[9] while smaller numbers are Shia and Ahmadi.
