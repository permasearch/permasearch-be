The Canadian Royal Family is a group of people related to the country's monarch and,[243] as such, belonging to the House of Windsor. There is no legal definition of who is or is not a member of the group, though the Government of Canada maintains a list of immediate members,[244][245] and stipulates that those in the direct line of succession who bear the style of Royal Highness (Altesse Royale) are subjects of,[246] and owe their allegiance specifically to, the reigning king or queen of Canada.[247]
