Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles[19]) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called burikko and this is considered a gender performance.[20] The term burikko (鰤子) is formed with buri (鰤, literally 'amberjack' a fish), a pun on furi (振, 'to pretend or pose'),[21] and ko (子, 'child').[20] It was a neologism developed in the 1980s by comedian Kuniko Yamada (山田邦子, Yamada Kuniko).[20]
