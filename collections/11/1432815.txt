Grand juries were once common across Canada.  The institution of British civil government in 1749 at Nova Scotia brought the judicature system peculiar to that form, and the grand jury was inherent to it.  A similar form derived in Quebec from the promise of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that a faithful copy of Laws of England would be instituted in the North American possessions of the Crown.[31] Archival records are found that document the presentments of a grand jury in Quebec as early as 16 October 1764.  One of the chief complaints was related to the jury trial, and the use of language.[32]  The desire for English law was a driver for the division in 1791 of Quebec, as it was then known, at the Ottawa river into Upper Canada and Lower Canada, as each of the two groups (French and English) desired to maintain their traditions.  In point of fact, the second law passed in Upper Canada relates to (petit) jury trial.  This was continued so that Chapter 31 of the 1859 Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada specifies the constitution of Grand and Petit Juries in the province (now known as Ontario).[33]  The colony at St. John's Island, ceded by France in 1763, and separated on 30 May 1769 from Nova Scotia,[34] became Prince Edward Island on 29 November 1798.  Prince Edward Island derived its grand jury from its administrative parent between 1763 and 1769, Nova Scotia, as did Sunbury County when it was split off in 1784 to become the Colony of New Brunswick.[34] The Colony of British Columbia, when it was formed on 2 August 1858, instituted a grand jury,[35] along with the Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands (1853–1863) and the Colony of Vancouver Island (1848–1866) when the latter were absorbed by the former.
