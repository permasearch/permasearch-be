On January 14, 1958, the US announced its "decision to establish a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System"[54] with Thule to be operational in 1959—total Thule/Clear costs in a May 1958 estimate were ~$800 million (an October 13, 1958, plan for both estimated completion in September 1960.)[55] The Lincoln Laboratory's radar at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts, was built and provided data to a 1958[56] for "trajectory estimates", e.g., Cape Canaveral missiles, and an "adjunct high-power UHF test facility employed the Millstone transmitter to stress-test the components that were candidates for the operational BMEWS."[6] (A twin of the Millstone Hill radar was dedicated at Saskatchewan's Prince Albert Radar Laboratory on June 6, 1959.)[6] A prototype AN/FPS-43 BMEWS radar[7] completed at Trinidad in 1958 went operational on February 4, 1959, the date of an Atlas IIB firing from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 11[57] (lunar reflection was tested January–June 1960).[58] On June 30, 1958, "NORAD emphasized that the BMEWS could not be considered as a self-contained entity separate from the Nike Zeus, or vice versa."[59]
