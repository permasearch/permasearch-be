Wagnard is a dark wizard, and a worshipper of Kardis, the goddess of destruction. He was originally a student of the magical academy in Valis (the same Slayn had attended), but was expelled for studying the dark arts of magic and cursed with a spell which restricted his ability to cast magic by inflicting severe pain whenever he does so. In time, however, Wagnard became mostly inured to the pain and managed to attain great power as a magician.
