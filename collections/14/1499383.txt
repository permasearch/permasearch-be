She had many hits during the seventies. With Marvin Hamlisch and Neil Simon, she wrote the lyrics for the stage musical They're Playing Our Song which was loosely based on her relationship with Hamlisch. The musical ran for over three years on Broadway. Many of Sager's 1980s songs were co-written with her former husband, the composer Burt Bacharach.[5] She executive-produced the eponymous solo album for June Pointer, of The Pointer Sisters, in 1989.
