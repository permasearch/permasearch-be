In spite of Ford's initial success with the LS, a lack of meaningful updates to the car prevented it from staying competitive and, ultimately, caused sales to plummet.[8] The LS went from a peak of over 51,000 cars sold in 2000 to less than 9,000 sold in its abbreviated 2006 model year.[9] Given this situation and Ford having no interest in further investments into the LS in favor of other products for Lincoln,[8] production of the Lincoln LS at the Wixom plant was ended in April 2006.[10] The Wixom plant itself was idled a year later. The de facto replacement for the LS was the front-wheel drive Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ.[11]
