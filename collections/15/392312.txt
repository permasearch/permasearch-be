With 12 guys left, some of the boys play a prank on a few of the "less popular" men that keeps them up all night. The sleep deprived few head into the days challenge a complete mess, but will the prank-ees have the last laugh at the end of the day? Wanting a man who can help build her financial empire, NY asks the boys to create a marketing plan to build her brand name. Some ideas are legitimate and professional and some are off the charts. Later, one of the guys from the winning team steals a private date with New York away from his teammate. The result is an angry house waiting for the back-stabber on his return. The following day, during a fashion photo shoot, someone gets down on his knees to impress New York. New York may have to send home more than one man. Man Man and Cheezy were both eliminated.
