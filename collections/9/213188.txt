The Chola dynasty has inspired many Tamil authors.[222] The most important work of this genre is the popular Ponniyin Selvan (The son of Ponni), a historical novel in Tamil written by Kalki Krishnamurthy.[223] Written in five volumes, this narrates the story of Rajaraja Chola, dealing with the events leading up to the ascension of Uttama Chola to the Chola throne. Kalki had used the confusion in the succession to the Chola throne after the demise of Parantaka CholaÂ II.[224] The book was serialised in the Tamil periodical Kalki during the mid-1950s.[225] The serialisation lasted for nearly five years and every week its publication was awaited with great interest.[226]
