Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms include: "often loses temper," "is often touchy or easily annoyed," "is often angry and resentful," "often argues with authority figures, or for children and adolescents, with adults," "often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules," "often deliberately annoys others," and "often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior."[2] In order to receive an ODD diagnosis, individuals must have at least 4 symptoms from above for at least 6 months (most days for youth younger than 5 years) with at least one individual who is not a sibling, which causes impairment in at least one setting.[2] Rule outs for a diagnosis include symptoms occurring concurrently during an episode of another disorder.[2]
