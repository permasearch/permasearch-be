Ã“ Briain married his wife Susan, a surgeon, in 2006;[23] they live in West London with their two children.[24] He was best man at his best friend Ed Byrne's wedding in 2008 after Byrne had previously been O'Briain's best man.[25] He describes himself as looking like "one of Tony Soprano's henchmen, on a bad day", and admits that, "living in London I probably only get recognised about once a day. And that's okay by me. I'm not a celebrity. And I certainly don't see myself as one."[26]
