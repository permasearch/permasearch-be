Co-operatives in the U.S. have a long history, including an early factory in the 1790s. By the 1860s Brigham Young had started applying co-operative ideas in Utah,[17] and by the 1880s, the Knights of Labor and the Grange both promoted member-owned organizations.[18] Energy co-operatives were founded in the U.S. during the Depression and the New Deal.[19] Diverse kinds of co-operatives were founded and have continued to perform successfully in different areas: in agriculture, wholesale purchasing, telephones, and in consumer-food buying.[20][21][22]
