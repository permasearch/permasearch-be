The Hollandic cities in the 13th century were less advanced than either their Eastern or Flemish counterparts; for the most part of the 14th and 15th century the Hollandic cities performed the role of intermediate between the latter and its trade partners oversees. Eventually they formed the bulk of the transport fleet sailing on Bruges and Ghent; which earned them considerable wealth and sparked further expansion. It wasn't till the Fall of Antwerp that the Hollandic cities (led by Amsterdam) would truly expand.
