Some studies have asserted that DTCPA misleads patients into demanding heavily-advertised drugs, leading to superfluous or sub-optimal treatment.  For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that 47% of all antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary, imposing significant additional costs on affected households.[19]  Another study found that young people living in West Palm Beach, Florida found that a 10% increase in advertising expose increased the total number of prescriptions by 5%; a higher percentage change than in Denver, Colorado – where DTCPA expenditures per person are lower.[20] Critics also argue that resources spent on DTCPA could otherwise be spent on developing new drugs and medical therapies.  Nine of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide spend more money on sales and marketing than on research and development.[21] US pharmaceutical companies are estimated to have spent 5.2 billion dollars on prescription drug advertising in 2015 most of which was spend on television advertising.[22]
