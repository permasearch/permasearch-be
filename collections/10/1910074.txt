The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) adopted the North American channel assignments, except channel nº 23, frequency 27.235 MHz; channel nº 24, frequency 27.245 MHz; channel nº 25, frequency 27.255 MHz.[33] However, legal CB equipment sold in Europe does follow the North American channel designation. Some member countries permit additional modes and frequencies; for example, Germany has 40 additional channels at 26 MHz for a total of 80. The United Kingdom has an additional 40 channels between 27.60125 and 27.99125 MHz, also making 80 in total. Before CEPT, most member countries used a subset of the 40 US channels.
