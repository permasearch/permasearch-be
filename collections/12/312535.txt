Clausell is best known for his painting, although he was also an orator, journalist, politician and lawyer.[2] He continued his rebellion against the Diaz regime after his graduation from law school, moving into journalism. At first he worked for El Universal, writing columns critical of the government under the pseudonym of Juan Pérez, but government pressure soon terminated this job. Afterwards he tried to establish his own publication La Soberanía de los Estados but it failed due to lack of funds.[2][3] He also collaborated with publications such as El Hijo del Ahuizote and El Monitor Republicano.[3] Soon after Díaz was re-elected for a third time, Clausell co-founded an opposition newspaper called El Demócrata in 1893, which he also directed.[3][1] Months after the founding, the paper began publishing excerpts of a fictionalized account of the army’s offensive against the Tarahumara people in Chihuahua in Tomóchic, under this name. This landed him and co founder Francisco R Blanco back into Belem Prison.[4][2] It was likely that the facts of the story, if not the story itself were relayed to Clausell by Heriberto Frías, but Clausell insisted it was all his own idea.[4] Just before his trial, Clausell escaped and with the help of friends self-exiled to the United States and France.[3]
