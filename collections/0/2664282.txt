Thousands of aliens orbit an unknown planet, from which a message no one can translate is continually being broadcast across time and space. The Doctor, drawn to the planet, uses a modified Cyberman head nicknamed "Handles" who tells him the planet is named "Gallifrey". The Doctor uses his TARDIS to collect Clara while she is having Christmas dinner with her family, and takes her to the Papal Mainframe, a space church orbiting the planet and headed by a former acquaintance of the Doctor, Mother Superior Tasha Lem. Tasha states they have constructed a force field around the planet to prevent the other aliens from landing, and offers the Doctor the opportunity to explore to find the source of the message.
