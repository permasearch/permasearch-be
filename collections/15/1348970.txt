Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service.[41] Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982.[41][42] Featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to 6,385 nautical miles (11,825Â km),[43] and was targeted at overseas customers.[9] The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984.[42] The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.[9]
