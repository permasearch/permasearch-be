The overall optical rotation of a mixture of chemicals can be calculated if the proportion of the amount of each chemical in the solution is known. If there are     N   {\displaystyle N}  -many optically active different chemicals ('chemical species') in a solution and the molar concentration (the number of moles of each chemical per Liter of liquid solution) of each chemical in the solution is known and written as      C  i     {\displaystyle C_{i}}   (where     i   {\displaystyle i}   is a number used to identify the chemical species); and if each species has a specific rotation (the optical rotation of that chemical were it made as a pure solution) written as     [ Î±  ]  i     {\displaystyle [\alpha ]_{i}}  , then the mixture has the overall optical rotation
