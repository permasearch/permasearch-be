Anglican missions were established by British colonists at Keppel Island in the Falklands in 1855 and in 1870 at Ushuaia on the main island, which continued to operate through the 19th century. Thomas Bridges (1842â€“1898) learned the language and compiled a 30,000-word Yaghan grammar and dictionary while he worked at Ushuaia.[4] It was published in the 20th century and considered an important ethnological work.[4]
