The word statistics, when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."[29] This should not be confused with the word statistic, referring to a quantity (such as mean or median) calculated from a set of data,[30] whose plural is statistics ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").
