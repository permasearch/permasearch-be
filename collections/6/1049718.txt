The President's daughter, while in Paris, receives a message with the code "Dark Ages" from a young woman from Eastern Europe named Nina. She tells her father about the strange person and the message, and she is requested to come back home immediately. The code "Dark Ages" is known only to eight people in the United States. It is a code name for a cyber security operation that America is running after its systems were hacked. The president is boggled as to who may have leaked this information.
