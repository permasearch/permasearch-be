Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin.[10] Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC.[11] Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC.[12] Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC.[13] Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.[14]
