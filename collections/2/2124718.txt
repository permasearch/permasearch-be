The Air-Surface Vessel Mark I, using electronics similar to those of the AI sets, was the first aircraft-carried radar to enter service, in early 1940. It was quickly replaced by the improved Mark II, which included side-scanning antennas that allowed the aircraft to sweep twice the area in a single pass. Mk. II had the power needed to detect submarines on the surface, eventually making such operations suicidal.
