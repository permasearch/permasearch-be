The Thompson achieved most of its early notoriety in the hands of Prohibition and Depression-era gangsters, motorized bandits and the lawmen who pursued them, and in Hollywood films about their exploits, most notably in the St Valentine's Day Massacre. The two Thompson guns used in the massacre, called "the most famous murder weapons in the world", are still held by the Berrien County Sheriff's Department.[30] It has been referred to by one researcher as the "gun that made the twenties roar".[31][32]
