As technology continues to enable new avenues for communication, collaboration, and circulation of ideas, it has also given rise to new opportunities for consumers to create their own content. Barriers like time and money are beginning to become less significant to large groups of consumers. For example, the creation of movies once required large amounts of expensive equipment, but now movie clips can be made with equipment that is affordable to a growing number of people. The ease with which consumers create new material has also grown. Extensive knowledge of computer programming is no longer necessary to create content on the internet. Media sharing over the Internet acts as a platform to invite users to participate and create communities that share similar interests through duplicated sources, original content, and repurposed material. YouTube is similar to creating ones own material but on a much smaller scale than films and movies. YouTuber's are able to use any camera and film a video. Some YouTuber's have millions of subscribers.  This has become a job for most people in today's world.  People are able to make their own content and connect with people all over the world.
