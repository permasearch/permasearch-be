Calhoun Square was laid out in 1851 and is named for South Carolina statesman John C. Calhoun, who served as Secretary of War, Secretary of State, and as Vice President under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.[9] It is sometimes called Massie Square in reference to a neighborhood school.[13] It is the only square with all of its original buildings intact.[17] It is located on Abercorn, between Taylor and Gordon Streets.
