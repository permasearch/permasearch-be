The movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface[114][115] but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less resistive path.[116] One theory suggests that lodestones, natural magnets encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.[117]
