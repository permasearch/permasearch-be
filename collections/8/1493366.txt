In 1971, two members of The Irish Rovers, one of which is dressed up like Shirley Temple, sing the song in one sketch as part of one of the episodes of The Irish Rovers Show. The song was performed by Elke Sommer on The Muppet Show in 1979. It was also on the Anne Murray album There's a Hippo in My Tub.
