Christian apologists such as G. K. Chesterton have repeated and amplified the significance of the "death" of Pan, suggesting that with the "death" of Pan came the advent of theology. To this effect, Chesterton once said, "It is said truly in a sense that Pan died because Christ was born. It is almost as true in another sense that men knew that Christ was born because Pan was already dead. A void was made by the vanishing world of the whole mythology of mankind, which would have asphyxiated like a vacuum if it had not been filled with theology."[34][35][36] It was interpreted with concurrent meanings in all four modes of medieval exegesis: literally as historical fact, and allegorically as the death of the ancient order at the coming of the new.[original research?] Eusebius of Caesarea in his Praeparatio Evangelica (book V) seems[dubious â€“ discuss] to have been the first Christian apologist to give Plutarch's anecdote, which he identifies as his source[citation needed], pseudo-historical standing, which Eusebius buttressed with many invented passing details that lent verisimilitude.[citation needed]
