An alternative explanation is that from around the 13th century the local area was owned by the Colt family, sometimes known as Coats, and their estate generated place-names such as Coatbridge, Coatdyke, Coathill and Coatbank.[6] Drummond and Smith suggest the name derives from the granting of land to Ranulphus le Colt around the time of the 12th century.[7] However, Early Scots /ol/ had vocalized to /o̞u/ by the 16th century[8] and subsequently diphthongised to /ʌu/ in Modern Scots,[9] so that 'Colt' would have become 'Cowt' rather than 'Coat'. Modern Scots 'Cot'[10] (cottage) is realized /kot/.
