The song was written and produced by Marc Anthony and Walter Afanasieff, and was the first single from the album Marc Anthony without a Spanish version and was dedicated to his daughter, Arianna. The single was less successful than the previous singles from the performer, peaking low at number 70 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Because no physical single was released, the track was charting airplay only.
