Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted reassurance that the character would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show.[31] The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991,[25] and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month.[32][33] Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles,[34] replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units.[30] Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail.[25] Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.[11]
