After the end of official support by Bethesda, some mod makers have repaired bugs in the latest official release of Daggerfall with community patches or engine remakes.[13][14] The DFQFIX quest-fix pack and HackFall were the most recent attempts at this.[15][16] DaggerfallSetup is a community-made Daggerfall installer for modern Windows versions.[17][18] The aim of this project is to install and easily run a fully patched Daggerfall on a modern Windows operating system under usage of the DOSBox emulator. This game installer setup contains many official and unofficial patches and also fan translations for several languages, including French, Russian, Spanish, and German.
