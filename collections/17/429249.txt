At the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV.[70] In April and May it petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould.[60] On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring "war" against the IRA and anyone helping it.[71] On 27 May the UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home. A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing a young Catholic from the Republic, Peter Ward.[60][71] Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed (made illegal) by the Northern Ireland government.[60] The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed in January 1967.[58][72]
