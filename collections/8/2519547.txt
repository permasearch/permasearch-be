Later, Christine is having lunch with Monica and friends when they hear a radio report that a child had drowned in the lake where Rhoda's school was having their picnic. Christine worries that the drowned child could be her daughter, but a follow-up report identifies the victim as the same Claude who had won the penmanship medal. Relieved that Rhoda is alive, Christine worries that her daughter might be traumatized by seeing the boyâ€™s corpse. When Rhoda returns home, however, she is unfazed by the incident and goes about her daily activities.
