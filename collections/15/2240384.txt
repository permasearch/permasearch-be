The 2009 Taconic State Parkway crash was a traffic collision that occurred shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 26, 2009, on the Taconic State Parkway in the town of Mount Pleasant, near the village of Briarcliff Manor, New York.[1] Eight people were killed when a minivan being driven by 36-year-old Diane Schuler traveled 1.7 miles in the wrong direction on the parkway and collided head-on with an oncoming SUV. The deaths included Schuler, her daughter and three nieces, and the three passengers in the oncoming SUV.[2] The crash was the worst fatal motor vehicle accident to occur in Westchester County[3] since July 22, 1934, when a bus accident in Ossining claimed 20 lives.[4][5]
