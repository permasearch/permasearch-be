Thomas had similar problems at home. These were exacerbated by the long separations due to his voyages at sea. When he was home, he kept his slave concubine Linda at close hand. She was a “ready lighted firebrand” between husband and wife. When his brother Jack’s only son drowned in 1853, Mary Ann wrote about the shame of presenting her “first passion of grief” for her nephew in front of her husband’s domestic concubine.[4] Their daughter died suddenly two years later, and Thomas died two years after that.
