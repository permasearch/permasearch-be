In North America, BeyWheelz was created due to the fact that Beyblade: Metal Fury episodes were cut to thirteen minutes from the 27th episode on, to share its time-slot with Cross Fight B-Daman. International versions of Metal Fury thus consist of 39 thirty-minute episodes, with the thirteen episodes of BeyWheelz completing the 52-episode season. This anime does not follow Metal Saga and instead takes place in a completely different universe where Bladers are called Wheelers and use BeyWheelz, wheel versions of existing Beyblades.
