Ratnam cast Mohan, with whom he had worked in Idaya Kovil, as the male lead. Revathi, the female lead, had collaborated with Ratnam on Pagal Nilavu (1984). Ratnam initially had "someone like Anant Nag and Supriya Pathak" in mind when he finished writing Mouna Ragam. Between finishing the story and making the film, he decided to include Revathi, whose performance in Mann Vasanai (1983) impressed him.[10] Nadhiya was also considered for the role, but she declined due to prior commitments.[17] Ra. Sankaran was cast as Divya's father, Chandramouli,[4] Kanchana as the lawyer[5] and V. K. Ramasamy as Chandrakumar's boss. Vani plays Divya's mother and Bhaskar her brother; Kalaiselvi and Sonia play her sisters.[3] Prabhu Deva, who became a successful Indian cinematic choreographer, made his acting debut in the film with an appearance in "Panivizhum Iravu"[18][19] as a boy playing a flute.[20]
