The 1922 committee drafting the Constitution of the Irish Free State submitted three drafts, of which Draft B explicitly prohibited the death penalty; the Provisional Government's final draft was based on Draft B but deleted this prohibition.[17]  British laws prescribing the death penalty thus continued in force.[18]  The death penalty was retained because of the outbreak of the 1922–3 Civil War.[18] As well as the existing British laws, the "Special Powers Act" (adopted in the form of a motion rather than an act of parliament) was passed by the Third Dáil on 26 September 1922 authorising military tribunals to impose death sentences on the anti-Treaty forces.[18][19][20][21] During the Civil War the Free State government executed 81 captured anti-Treaty fighters by firing squad,[18] as well as ordering extra-judicial killings.[16]
