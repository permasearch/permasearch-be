It has been suggested that green and black tea may protect against cancer[72] or other diseases such as obesity[73] or Alzheimer's disease,[74] but the compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect on human diseases.[75][76] One human study demonstrated that regular consumption of black tea over four weeks had no beneficial effect in lowering blood cholesterol levels.[77]
