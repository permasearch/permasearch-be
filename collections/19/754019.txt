Stephen Hawking was originally a believer in the Theory of Everything but, after considering GÃ¶del's Theorem, concluded that one was not obtainable: "Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate theory, that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used to belong to that camp, but I have changed my mind."[42]
