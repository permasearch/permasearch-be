The uniform for girls in years 7 to 11 (introduced in 2013) is a knee length brown skirt, a yellow blouse and a brown blazer. Previously, from 2010 to 2016 the uniform was a cream and brown stripped blouse, a pleated knee length skirt and a brown blazer. Before that, the skirts were ankle length, as was common at the time to schools in Bishop's Stortford. All Sixth Form students are required to adhere to a dress code of business wear.
