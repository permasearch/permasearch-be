Ten years later, Brown characterized positive face by desires to be liked, admired, ratified, and related to positively, noting that one would threaten positive face by ignoring someone. At the same time, she characterized negative face by the desire not to be imposed upon, noting that negative face could be impinged upon by imposing on someone.[9] Positive face refers to one's self-esteem, while negative face refers to one's freedom to act.[1][10] These two aspects of face are the basic wants in any social interaction; during any social interaction, cooperation is needed amongst the participants to maintain each other's face.[1] Participants can do this by using positive politeness and negative politeness, which pay attention to people's positive and negative face needs respectively.[7]
