Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males.[130] Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older ones.[131] Thus these bulls have more reproductive success.[121] Musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths.[132] For young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance.[133] During copulation, the male lays his trunk over the female's back.[134] The penis is very mobile, being able to move independently of the pelvis.[135] Prior to mounting, it curves forward and upward. Copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause.[136] Elephant sperm must swim close to 2 m (6.6 ft) to reach the egg. By comparison, human sperm has to swim around only 76.2 mm (3.00 in).[137]
