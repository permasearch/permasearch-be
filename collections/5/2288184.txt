While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean,[2] modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle.[4] Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black.[4][6] The markings are clearly defined, and there is a trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail.[4] The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.[2]
