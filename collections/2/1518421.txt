In 2011, Scott Carney coined the term "Red Market" to describe a broad category of economic transactions related to the human body.[74] He argues that advances in science have served to increase the demand for human body parts. He writes that this increased demand has enabled a vast "Red Market," encompassing a wide variety of transactions, from organ sale to organ thievery, 'bone thievery,' 'blood farming,' and even rented space in women's wombs.[74]
