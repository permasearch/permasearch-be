As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.[11] He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym.[8] At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career.[3][4] He later said, "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting."[10] However, his official website biography claims that "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career."[17] During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school."[18]
