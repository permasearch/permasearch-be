Because it would take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50â€“75% of body weight[36]) with heavy water, accidental or intentional poisoning with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require that the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.
