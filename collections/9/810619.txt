In 1965, the turnpike commission announced plans to build second tubes at the Tuscarora, Kittatinny, and Blue Mountain tunnels while a 13.5-mile (21.7 km) bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels would be built.[233] A bypass of these two tunnels was considered in the 1930s, but at the time was determined to be too expensive.[88] An early 1960s study concluded that a bypass would be the best option to handle traffic at Rays Hill and Sideling Hill.[88][234] The turnpike commission sold $77.5 million in bonds in January 1966 to finance this project.[235] Construction of the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels involved building a cut across both hills.[236][237] The new alignment began at the Breezewood interchange, where a portion of the original turnpike was used to access US 30.[238] In building the cut across Rays Hill, a portion of US 30 had to be realigned.[236] The cut over Sideling Hill passes over the Sideling Hill Tunnel.[237] The new alignment ends a short distance east of the Cove Valley service plaza on the original segment. This bypass of the two tunnels would have a 36-foot (11 m)-wide median with a steel barrier in the middle.[70] The turnpike bypass of Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels opened to traffic on November 26, 1968.[88] When the highway was realigned to bypass the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels, the Cove Valley service plaza on the original section was closed and replaced with the Sideling Hill service plaza (the only service plaza on the main turnpike serving travelers in both directions).[70]
