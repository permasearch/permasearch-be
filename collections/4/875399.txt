The establishment of Israel at the end of World War II was a complex issue. Based on its own experience during partition, when 14 million people were displaced[368][369] and an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people were killed in Punjab Province,[370] India had recommended a single state, as did Iran and Yugoslavia (later to undergo its own genocidal partition). The state could allocate Arab- and Jewish-majority provinces with a goal of preventing partition of historic Palestine and prevent widespread conflict.[371] But, the final UN resolution recommended partition of Mandatory Palestine into Arab and Jewish states based on religious and ethnic majorities. India opposed this in the final vote as it did not agree with the concept of partition on the basis of religion.[372]
