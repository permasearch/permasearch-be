The projection fibers consist of efferent and afferent fibers uniting the cortex with the lower parts of the brain and with the spinal cord. In human neuroanatomy, bundles of axons (nerve fibres) called tracts, within the brain, can be categorized by their function into association fibers, projection fibers, and commissural fibers.
