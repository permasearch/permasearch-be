Oganesson is expected to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon.[2] By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is expected that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K.[2] This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263Â K[67] or 247 K.[68] Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions,[2] and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.
