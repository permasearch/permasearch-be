Demon Lord Ghirahim (ギラヒム, Girahimu) is encountered several times throughout Skyward Sword, as he relentlessly pursues Zelda in order to revive Demise. Though he appears delicate and acts in a playful, flamboyant manner, Ghirahim is a cruel sadist with a dangerous short-fused temper. He arrogantly toys with Link in their first two battles, then reveals his full power in a final battle prior to Demise's release. With his mission accomplished, Ghirahim is revealed to be the spirit of Demise's sword, given life for the sole purpose of restoring his master to his original form. He returns to his sword form before being shattered during Demise's climactic battle with Link. During the events of Hyrule Warriors, Ghirahim is summoned from the past by Cia to fight for her before becoming a follower of the revived Ganondorf. Ghirahim also appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an Assist Trophy.
