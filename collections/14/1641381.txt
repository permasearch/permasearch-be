On a few occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, tensions have flared between Australian Muslims and the general population. The Sydney gang rapes formed a much reported set of incidents in 2000; a group of Lebanese men sexually assaulted non-Muslim women. In 2005, tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Cronulla area of Sydney led to violent rioting; the incident resulted in mass arrests and criminal prosecution. In 2012, Muslims protesting in central Sydney against Innocence of Muslims, an anti-Islam film trailer, resulted in rioting.[28] There was an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the Sydney hostage crisis on 15â€“16 December 2014, including a threat made against a mosque in Sydney.[29] However, the Muslim community also received support from the Australian public through a social media campaign.[30][31]
