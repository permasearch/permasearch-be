The 2015 prediction of El Ni単o to bring rains to California raised hopes of ending the drought. In the spring of 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration named the probability of the presence of El Ni単o conditions until the end of 2015 at 80%. Historically, sixteen winters between 1951 and 2015 had created El Ni単o. Six of those had below-average rainfall, five had average rainfall, and five had above-average rainfall. However, as of May 2015, drought conditions had worsened and above average ocean temperatures had not resulted in large storms.[30]
