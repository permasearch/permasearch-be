Some scholars and critics challenge the validity of Pinter's critiques of what he terms "the modes of thinking of those in power"[211] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work.[212] In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being "terribly disturbed as a young man by the Cold War. And McCarthyismÂ ... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly now that we have an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny."[213] Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.[214]
