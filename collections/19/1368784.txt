A landmark study found that fluoxetine (Prozac) was more likely to increase overall suicidal behavior. 14.7% of the patients (n = 44) on fluoxetine had suicidal events, compared to 6.3% in the psychotherapy group and 8.4% from the combined treatment group.[129] Eli Lilly, the manufacturer, and the lead researcher did not make these findings obvious.[130] Several internal documents, which were released by the British Medical Journal, indicated a link between use of Prozac and suicidal or violent behavior. The FDA has warned that Prozac and similar antidepressants could cause agitation, panic attacks and aggression.[131] These documents revealed that Eli Lilly knew about this as early as 1984, years before the drug was FDA-approved.[132]
