Latvia has been a part of the European Union for over a decade already and one of the immense advantages of being a Latvian citizen is the freedom to travel and work in the European Union and live anywhere in the EU. The possession of a Latvian passport is like having a passport to any EU country, which gives a right to live and work in one of the 32 countries of EU and EFTA: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. Holders of Latvian passport can study for free in one of the best European universities (university education in many of Western European countries is free or heavily subsidized), get grants/loans for education and have access to EU healthcare system.[5]
