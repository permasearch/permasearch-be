Per RFC 7231, the POST method should be used when a request is non-idempotent: that is, when it should change the server state each time it is performed, for example submitting a comment to a blog post or voting in an online poll. GET is defined to be nullipotent, with no side-effects, and idempotent operations have "no side effects on second or future requests".[10][11] For this reason, web crawlers such as search engine indexers normally use the GET and HEAD methods exclusively, to prevent their automated requests from performing such actions.
