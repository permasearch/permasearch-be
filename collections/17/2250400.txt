Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire was despatched to the Senecas to obtain permission to build a French post on the banks of the river. It was in 1720 that he spoke to several chiefs, explaining that his pleasure was always great when he visited them but that he would do it more spontaneously still if he had a dwelling place. Considering that he was of the tribe since his turbulent captivity and his "adoption", the chiefs agreed that he had the right to build a dwelling where it pleased. Joncaire and eight men dispatched from Fort Frontenac built on the right bank of the river a trading post, called Magasin Royal or Maison de la Paix (Royal Store or House of Peace). The trading post was  carefully called the "House of Peace", emphasizing the French peaceful intents; it was represented chiefly as a place to exchange goods for furs.[3]
