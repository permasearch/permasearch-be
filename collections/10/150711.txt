In May 2013 a stage musical adaptation of the comic strip debuted at the Adventure Theatre MTC in Maryland.[6] The production's story centers on Nate, who tries to enter his school's Battle of the Bands competition but must try to avoid getting any more detentions, as too many would disqualify his band from competing. Critical reception for the musical has been positive.[7][8]
