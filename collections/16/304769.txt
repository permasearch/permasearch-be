Initially, the oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the chemical weathering of reducing minerals (those able to be oxidized), most notably iron. This 'mass rusting' led to the deposition of iron(III) oxide in the form of banded-iron formations such as the sediments in Minnesota and Pilbara, Western Australia. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities shortly (~50 million years) before the start of the GOE.[14] Without a mineral sink in the form of iron, oxygen could have accumulated very rapidly. For example, at today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in Precambrian when there were no land plants), modern atmospheric O2 levels could be produced in around 2,000Â years.[15]
