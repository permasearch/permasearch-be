On May 20, 2014, GM announced that it was recalling 1,402 units of the 2015 Escalade and Escalade ESV that were built between January 2014 to May 2014 due to "an insufficiently heated plastic weld that attaches the (front) passenger side air bag to the instrument panel assembly could result in a partial deployment of the air bag in the event of a crash." GM also placed a temporary halt on further sales and informed owners of the affected vehicles to not let passengers sit in the front passenger seat until they are replaced.[45]
