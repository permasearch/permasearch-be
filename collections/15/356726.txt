Team challenge: After an early morning wake-up call from sous chef James, the teams were brought outside Hell's Kitchen, where two lakes of icy water had been set up; one containing fish heads, and one containing fish bodies. The teams were split into pairs and each had to match up the heads and bodies of a particular fish; the men accomplished this first, and got five extra minutes in which to cook dishes using one of the four varieties of fish. Each member of the pair cooked their own dish, then faced off against their counterparts on the other team, with Ramsay and guest judge Michael Cimarusti awarding the best dishes a point. Bret took the first point for the men with his trout dish, before Mieka took a point for her salmon dish, and Sarah earned a 2–1 lead for the women with her cod dish. On the final round it initially looked as the challenge would end in a tie, as Michelle's and Alison's halibut dishes were deemed mediocre, and both Milly's and Adam's were well-liked. However, Chef Cimarusti noticed that both of the men's dishes used the exact same side of rice, and the two men admitted that due to Adam being unable to cook his intended risotto side in time, Milly allowed him to borrow some spare rice. Chef Ramsay deemed this to be in violation of the challenge rules, however, and instantly disqualified Milly and Adam. Michelle's dish was chosen to receive the final point, as it was slightly better than Alison's, meaning that the women won 3–1.
