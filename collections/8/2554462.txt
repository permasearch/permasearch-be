The Garfield Show also features many new characters that are part of the regular cast such as Vito: an Italian chef whose cooking Garfield enjoys and Squeak: Garfield's mouse friend that lives in Jon's house (replacing Floyd from the previous show). Unlike Garfield and Friends, the U.S. Acres segments and characters are omitted.
