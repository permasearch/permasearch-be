In Toy Story, it is hinted that he used to be Andy's favorite toy years before the events of the film, until he received Woody at the point of kindergarten, and therefore seems to have a strong jealousy towards Andy`s love for Woody. Then, when Andy gets the Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday he becomes fascinated with all of Buzz's features and ridicules Woody for not having a laser like Buzz as well as Woody's pull-string. After Buzz is knocked out of the window, Potato Head (perhaps due to his jealously towards Woody, and wanting to reclaim his long lost favorite toy position) blames Woody for kicking him out, thinking that Woody might do the same to him if Andy plays with him more often, and turns the other toys against Woody and leads a mutiny with them. When Woody reveals himself at Sid's House later, Mr. Potato Head convinces the others to refuse to help him, still assuming that Woody attacked Buzz. But when they are packed up Mr. Potato Head is still unhappy because he is stuck with Rex as a moving buddy and put in a moving truck. Later when Woody catches up with them and tosses RC onto the street to rescue Buzz, Potato Head, still distrusting Woody (and perhaps still eager to reclaim his favorite toy position), orders the other toys to mutiny again, and "toss him overboard", however, when Bo Peep reveals that "Woody was telling the truth," the toys realize their mistake. He decides to reform himself as an apology to Woody by holding Slinky's tail to help Woody and Buzz back at the truck but gets hit after Slinky's attempt fails. When Woody tosses RC in the truck, Potato Head gets hit. At the end of the film, he is surprised to hear Molly receiving Mrs. Potato Head for her Christmas present and promptly decides to shave by removing his mustache.
