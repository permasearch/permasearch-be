Loria left Montreal shortly after, as he sold the Expos to MLB and used the money he received from the sale to purchase the Florida Marlins from John Henry, who had recently purchased the Boston Red Sox.[140] As a result of the transaction, Loria turned a significant profit on his initial $16 million investment â€“ MLB bought the Expos from him for $120 million and gave him a $38.5 million interest free loan to complete the purchase of the Marlins.[151] Following the sale, Loria took virtually everything of value with him to Miami, including the Expos' computers and scouting reports.[154] His departure also marked the final end of the proposed Labatt Park, though any realistic chance of the park being built ended when the Bouchard government repeated its previous refusal to commit any public money to the project.[155]
