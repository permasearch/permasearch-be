CIUP was established after World War I by André Honnorat, rector at the Sorbonne, in cooperation with Émile Deutsch de la Meurthe, in order to create a meeting place for students, researchers and intellectuals from around the world in a spirit of peace, unity and friendly cooperation. The CIUP was originally built for the University of Paris, hence its name appears in several of its buildings, notably the Maison Internationale.
