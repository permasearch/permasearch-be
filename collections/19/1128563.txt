"Wanted Dead or Alive" is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi. It is from their 1986 album Slippery When Wet. The song was written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora and was released in 1987 as the album's third single. During a February 20, 2008 encore performance in Detroit, Jon Bon Jovi told the crowd about running into Bob Seger at a Pistons game. As he introduced his song "Wanted Dead or Alive", he said it was inspired by Seger's "Turn the Page" hit and called the song the band's anthem.[1] The song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,[2] making it the third single from the album to reach the Top 10 of the Hot 100. As a result, Slippery When Wet was the first hard rock/glam metal album to have 3 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.
