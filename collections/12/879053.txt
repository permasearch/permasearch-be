Though Nancy's age is not given she appears to be thirteen to fourteen on the cover art. This has not been addressed in the content of the books as Nancy has a boyfriend in college and drives with a nonrestrictive license. Her speech and actions are sometimes written as someone older than this age range, and her immature appearance and stature are not commented on by other characters in the series. This Nancy does not navigate in the world of adults as previous versions of the character. The first person narration reveals a juvenile voice with a passive role in the action and a lack of motivation in solving mysteries. In book #12 The Sign in the Smoke Nancy does not solve the mystery, a secondary character comes up with the solution. In several books Nancy stumbles upon the solution to the "mystery" and acts amazed at the reveal. This is in contrast to the set-up of previous Nancy Drew series.
