This high-church style is reflected most obviously in the vestments and other liturgical clothing used by participants in the Mass. The choir and lay servers wear black cassocks and full-length surplices (unlike many parishes which favor the shorter and more modern cotta), the vergers (of which there are nearly always two for Eucharists on Sundays) wear cassocks and blue/gray vergers' gowns, and the assisting clergy vest as the choir with the addition of a stole (or tippet for the priest who is preaching to be exchanged at the start of the Eucharistic liturgy for a stole). The participating clergy wear eucharistic vestments. The three participating clerics wear amices and maniples, the presider wears a chasuble, the deacons a dalmatic, and the subdeacon (an uncommon office outside of Anglo-Catholicism) a tunicle. The rector, by nature of his office as bishop (though he is no longer responsible for a diocese), vests differently from the other clergy. When presiding at the Eucharist, he wears a mitre in addition to the chasuble. At other times, he sometimes wears a scarlet chimere over his rochet. All of the eucharistic vestments were recently[when?] replaced by Watts & Co. of London. For Evensong, the presiding priest vests in a cope.
