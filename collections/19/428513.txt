The history of Sudan includes both the territory that is today part of the Republic of the Sudan as well as a larger region known by the term "Sudan". The term is derived from Arabic: بلاد السودان‎‎ bilād as-sūdān "land of the black people",[1][2] and can be used more loosely of West and Central Africa in general, especially the Sahel.
