Further meriting its nickname of the Silicon Valley of India, Bengaluru is home to India's largest start-ups (Flipkart, Ola Cabs, iD Fresh Foods[6]) and has been repeatedly recognised as and rated the best city in India and one of the best in the world to start your own company. Complimented by the booming IT industry and venture capitalists and investors such as Goldman Sachs and NASDAQ, whose India branches are based out of Bengaluru , make it the perfect place for new tech companies. Bengaluru is also home to the majority of India's unicorns and to the world's largest pure-play data analytics firm - Mu Sigma. The Koramangala neighbourhood has one of the highest densities of start-ups in the world, second only to Silicon Valley, California.[7][8][9]
