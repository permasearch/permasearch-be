A 1988, CBS, Saturday morning kids show titled Hey Vern It's Ernest had a segment in each episode titled "Earl the Barber". Earl is clearly patterned after Mayberry's barber, Floyd. In each episode, lead character Ernest P. Worrell comes in for a haircut and after giving it some thought tells Earl he wants his hair cut to make him look like a Wall Street tycoon. Earl is then shown in quick picture cuts (with fast music) "going to work". When finished he gives Ernest a mirror to check out his handy work. Ernest, shocked at the results, excitedly says "Earl, this doesn't make me look like a Wall Street tycoon." Realizing his mistake, Earl says "silly me, why I thought you said a baby baboon" or a windswept dune or a lazy lagoon, for example. Earl then asks Ernest how he likes the new look. After taking a second look at the mirror, Ernest replies "It could work."
