In an early review, Billboard called the record "short, to the point, and bristling with attitude," and predicted it would poise the band for commercial breakthrough.[84] In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone's Neva Chonin wrote, "It's all harmless but still gnarly enough to foment the kind of anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll way back in the day."[43] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic desbribed it as a "fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release."[81] Kerrang! wrote that the album includes "enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that blink will be remembered for more than just onstage nudity."[85] The catchy, pop sensibility of the album was praised by Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club, describing the band as finding success within a "well-worn genre" (punk rock).[86] The New York Times also designated the record its 'Album of the Week'.[85] The record did have its detractors: British music publication New Musical Express (NME) gave the record a very poor review, calling the record despicable, "wholly toothless and soulless" and deriding the band as "as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy."[87]
