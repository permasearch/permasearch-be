The final saw Celtic play Inter Milan, with the match taking place at the Est√°dio Nacional on the outskirts of Lisbon on 25 May 1967. Celtic fell a goal behind after only seven minutes, Jim Craig adjudged to have fouled Renato Cappellini in the penalty box and Sandro Mazzola converting the resultant penalty.[25] Celtic swept into constant attack after that, but found Inter goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti in outstanding form.[25] With 63 minutes played, after incessant pressure Celtic finally equalised when Tommy Gemmell scored with a powerful 25-yard shot.[25] The balance of play remained constant, with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti.[26] It proved to be the winning goal and thus Celtic became the first British team, and the first from outside Spain, Portugal or Italy, to win the competition.[25] The cup-winning side have since become known as the Lisbon Lions.[27] Celtic remain the only Scottish club to have reached the final.[27]
