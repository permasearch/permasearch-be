U2 were aware when they decided to record "Sunday Bloody Sunday" that its lyrics could be misinterpreted as sectarian, and possibly place them in danger. Some of the Edge's original lyrics explicitly spoke out against violent rebels, but were omitted to protect the group.[10] Even without these lyrics, some listeners still considered it to be a rebel songâ€”even one which glorifies the events of the two Bloody Sundays to which the lyrics refer.[18]
