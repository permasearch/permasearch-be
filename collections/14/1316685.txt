here has been a vast reduction in violence against LGBT individuals in Jamaica.[citation needed] The U.S. Department of State reported that brutality with homosexuals, mainly by private citizens, was widespread in 2008.[9] Homosexuality per se is not illegal in Jamaica; however the Offenses Against the Person Act criminalizes buggery (anal sex) as well as "acts of gross indecency" between men.  Many Jamaicans are hostile toward LGBT and intersex people, and several mob attacks against gay people have been reported.[10][11][12] International human rights groups, the local LGBT rights organization, Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (JFLAG) and many Jamaicans have called on the government to take measures to protect LGBT people, including repealing the buggery law.[13][14][15]
