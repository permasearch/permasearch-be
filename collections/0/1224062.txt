Zeno leaves the castle to track down the descendants of the dragon warriors. He is shot with a bow and arrow by some archers, and he wakes up in a hut to a girl named Kaya. She reveals that she has a contagious disease, hence why she lives in a secluded area. Since Zeno cannot get ill, he spends time with her and takes care of her. He eventually asks for her hand in marriage, and she cries in response. Overnight, Zeno holds Kaya's hand as she dies and rots. After many years, Zeno sets out to find the descendants of the dragon warriors for the sake of King Hiryuu. Zeno visits the villages of the dragon warriors, meeting a four-year-old Kija after he bathes, meeting a two-year-old Shin-Ah while playing with a ball and meeting a nine-year-old Jae-Ha sleeping while shackled at his wrists and ankles. In the present, Zeno wakes up in his tent to his friends and gives them a group hug, making them uncomfortable. Since Yoon opted out of the drinking competition due to doing various chores, Jae-Ha forfeits his win to Yoon, with no objections from the others.
