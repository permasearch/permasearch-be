When the first out-of-town tryout in New Haven proves disastrous, Tony demands that Jeffrey convert the production back into the light comedy that the Martons had originally envisioned. Jeffrey says that while they will have to find new backers since the original ones have walked out, he will be happy to appear in that showâ€”if Tony is in charge of it. Tony accepts, financing the production himself by selling his art collection. Paul says the show is no longer suitable for Gaby and walks out, expecting her to follow, but she is now pleased to stay and work with Tony.
