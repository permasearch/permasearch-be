Through the 2013 tournament, each of the three major conferences (MPSF, MIVA and EIVA) received an automatic bid to the Final Four, with one additional at-large bid. The remaining bid was an at-large bid that could be awarded to any team in Division I or II (including Rutgersâ€“Newark). Generally, the best team not receiving an automatic bid (usually from one of the three major conferences) received the at-large bid.
