In most sources, Ottoman losses are estimated at between 5,000–6,000,[3][54][63] although Kenan Celik from Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, has placed their losses as high as 7,164,[4] broken down as 1,520 killed, 4,700 wounded, 760 listed as missing and 134 captured by the Australians.[4][57] These included the commanding officers of both the 47th and 15th Regiments.[4] Of the Australian force that had launched the attack, almost half became casualties. Australian losses during the battle amounted to 2,277 men killed or wounded,[3] out of the total 4,600 men committed to the fighting over the course of the battle.[2] These represent some of the highest casualties of the campaign.[64] The toll was particularly heavy amongst the Australian officers; both the commanding officers of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were killed leading their troops.[57] After the battle, the dead were so thick on the ground that one Australian, Captain Harold Jacobs of the 1st Battalion, remarked "[t]he trench is so full of our dead that the only respect that we could show them was not to tread on their faces, the floor of the trench was just one carpet of them, this in addition to the ones we piled into Turkish dugouts."[34] Later, over 1,000 dead were removed from Australian position to be hastily buried.[57]
