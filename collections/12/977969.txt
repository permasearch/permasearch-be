The phrase "lest we forget" forms the refrain of "Recessional". It is taken from Deuteronomy 6,12: "Then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt".[2] The reference to the "ancient sacrifice" as a "humble and a contrite heart" is taken from the Miserere, (Psalm 51).[6]
