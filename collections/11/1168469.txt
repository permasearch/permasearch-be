Rebel director Nicholas Ray is on record as saying that Dean was gay,[139] while author John Howlett believes that Dean was "certainly bisexual".[57] George Perry's biography attributes these reported aspects of Dean's sexuality to "experimentation".[140] Martin Landau stated, "A lot of gay guys make him out to be gay. Not true."[141] Mark Rydell stated, "I don't think he was essentially homosexual. I think that he had very big appetites, and I think he exercised them."[142] Elizabeth Taylor, with whom Dean had become friends after they first met on the set of Giant, referred to Dean as gay during a speech at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2001.[143] Biographer Darwin Porter believes that Dean was more likely omnisexual, and that his trysts were often opportunistic and designed to further his career.[144]
