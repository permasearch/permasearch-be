The skeletal features and growth patterns associated with hypodontia are unknown although there is some evidence to suggest that the cranio-facial features of individuals with missing teeth are different from those with a full natural dentition. Patients with hypodontia commonly present with a smaller lower anterior face height and lip protrusion which are linked with lower mandibular plane angles. Smaller lengths of maxilla and mandible and a Class III skeletal base are also associated with hypodontia. The tendency of the patient to have these skeletal effects becomes more significant as the severity of agenesis increases, especially when more than one type of tooth is missing.[21] Patients may appear over-closed due to the short face height and large freeway space associated with hypodontia.
