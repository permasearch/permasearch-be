Since the ROC lost its United Nations seat as "China" in 1971 (replaced by the PRC), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognizing or acknowledging the PRC to be the sole legitimate representative of all China, though the majority of countries deliberately avoid stating clearly what territories they believe China includes and maintain strategic ambiguity in order to associate with both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) simultaneously.  As of 24 May 2018, the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with 17Â UN member states and the Holy See,[1] although informal relations are maintained with nearly all others. Agencies of foreign governments such as the American Institute in Taiwan operate as de facto embassies of their home countries in Taiwan, and Taiwan operates similar de facto embassies and consulates in most countries under such names as "Taipei Representative Office" (TRO) or "Taipei Economic and Cultural (Representative) Office" (TECO). In certain contexts, Taiwan is also referred to as Chinese Taipei.
