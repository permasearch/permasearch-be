"How Do I Live" was also covered by F.I.R. (Faye and Real featuring LeAnn Rimes). F.I.R. invited Rimes to record a portion of the song for their third album Flight Tribe in 2006.[9] Billboard Magazine ranked "How Do I Live" as the most successful song of the 1990s despite not going to number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[10]
