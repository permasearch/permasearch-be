A major obstacle to cultural sensitivity and good communication is ethnocentrism, which is the belief that ones ethical group is superior to another; this causes prejudice and stops a nurse for fully understanding the patient. Another obstacle is stereotyping, a patient’s background is often multifaceted encompassing many ethic and cultural traditions. In order to individualize communication and provide culturally sensitive care it is important to understand the complexity of social, ethnic, cultural and economic. This involves overcoming certain attitudes and offering consistent, non-judgemental care to all patients. Accepting the person for who they are regardless of diverse backgrounds and circumstances or differences in morals or beliefs.  By exhibiting these attributes trust can grow between patient and nurse.[6][8] Nurses need to know the outcome of social, cultural, and racial differences, and how they can affect the therapeutic relationship.[9] Nurses need to acknowledge the impact of culture in order to practice health in a way that respects a person’s beliefs and values.[12]
