Patsy's scheming, conniving, malevolent sister Jackie (played by Kate O'Mara) appears in two episodes. In the series 3 episode "Happy New Year", Jackie visits Patsy and Edina on New Year's Eve 1994, hoping to be able to stay for the long term at Edina's house. Strangely all Edina's family are eager to meet Jackie even though Edina, to everyone's surprise, warns them against it. Jackie is particularly cruel to Saffy (of course, this is the one thing about Jackie Edina is prepared to ignore), and later admits she is jealous of Patsy's relatively stable life with people who can tolerate her. She later claims that their mother actually loved Patsy since, out of all the children she had, she bothered to send Patsy to school (although Patsy points out that by the time she went, she was "bigger than the teacher.") Patsy later aids her in stealing money and jewelry from Edina, before Jackie returns to Paris to run her charity for unwanted cats. In the course of the episode, it is revealed that there are many other Stone siblings, but nobody knows how many, as their mother "was such a slut". Jackie also forces Patsy to claim that she is the older of the two, by burning her with a cigarette. Jackie admits to being 72 years old when she is alone with Patsy. Jackie later returns in the series 5 episode "Cold Turkey", when she is summoned to the hospital where Patsy is feared to be dying, apparently from the effects of a voodoo doll in Jackie's possession. In the hospital, the two sisters recall how Jackie stole the "only man Patsy ever loved". After forcing Patsy to leave her everything in her will, Jackie prepares to murder Patsy through a massive heroin overdose. However, it is Jackie who is discovered dead the next morning, the implication being that Patsy managed to turn the tables and that she in fact murdered Jackie.
