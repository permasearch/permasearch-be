If symptoms are well controlled with moisturizers, steroids may only be required when flares occur.[4] Corticosteroids are effective in controlling and suppressing symptoms in most cases.[46] Once daily use is generally enough.[4] For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g., hydrocortisone), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g., clobetasol propionate) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.
