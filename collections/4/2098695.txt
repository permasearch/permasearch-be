The total stress on the bed of an open channel of infinite width is given by the hydrostatic pressure acting on the bed. For a fluid of density     ρ   {\displaystyle \rho }  , an acceleration due to gravity     g   {\displaystyle g}  , and a flow depth     h   {\displaystyle h}  , the pressure exerted on the bed is simply the weight of an element of fluid,     ρ g   {\displaystyle \rho g}  , times the depth of the flow,     h   {\displaystyle h}  . From this, we get the expression for the total pressure,      P  b     {\displaystyle P_{b}}  , acting on the bed.
