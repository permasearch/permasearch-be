Production relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes.[98] Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, "It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging".[99] Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio.[100] The station's Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.[101] A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.[102] Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroitâ€“Superior Bridge.[103] Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.[104]
