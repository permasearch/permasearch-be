Because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths, it is an important infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14Â micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications.[64] It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors.[66] It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.[69][70]
