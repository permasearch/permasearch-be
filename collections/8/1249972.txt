TOF is typically treated by open heart surgery in the first year of life.[8] Timing of surgery depends on the baby's symptoms and size.[8] The procedure involves increasing the size of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary arteries and repairing the ventricular septal defect.[8] In babies who are too small a temporary surgery may be done with plans for a second surgery when the baby is bigger.[8] Most people who are affected live to be adults.[4] Long-term problems may include an irregular heart rate and pulmonary regurgitation.[3]
