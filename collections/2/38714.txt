Proponents of a national popular vote point out combined population of the 50 biggest cities (not including metropolitan areas) only amounts to 15% of the population,[112][113] and that candidates in popular vote elections for governor and U.S. Senate, and for statewide allocation of electoral votes, do not ignore voters in less populated areas.[114] In addition, it is already possible to win the required 270 electoral votes by winning only the 11 most populous states; what currently prevents such a result is the organic political diversity between those states (three reliably Republican states, four swing states, and four reliably Democratic states), not any inherent quality of the Electoral College itself.[115] If all of those states came to lean reliably for one party, then the Electoral College itself would bring about an urban-centric victory.
