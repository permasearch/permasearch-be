Every student at St. Stephen's is assigned a faculty advisor, who approves the student's course schedule and is responsible for ensuring his or her academic progress. The group of students assigned to each faculty member are known as an "advisory," and often meet jointly with the advisor or to take part in group activities. Morning advisories also serve the purpose of verifying attendance. In the middle school, the advisory meetings are held once a week on Wednesdays, whereas in the upper school, advisory meetings are held every day before chapel.
