The eighth generation Toyota Hilux was officially released simultaneously on 21 May 2015 in Bangkok, Thailand and Sydney, Australia.[36] The Thai, Laos and Cambodia market also adopted a new name, "Toyota Hilux Revo". The Hilux uses the "Keen Look" design language that has already been used in the Toyota Corolla (E170) with slim projector headlights and LED DRL (Daytime Running Lights). This design continues into the interior with similar AC vent and center fascia design. This generation features Toyota's first autonomous emergency braking (AEB).[37] New ESTEC GD 2.4-liter, 2.8-liter and KD 2.5-liter, 3.0-liter diesel engines, shared with the Fortuner and Innova, were combined with a five- or six-speed manual transmission or a five- or six-speed automatic transmission with sequential shift.[38] The 2.8-liter GD engine was introduced in May 2015 at the 36th International Vienna Motor Symposium.[39] The 2.0, 2.7- and 4.0-liter petrol engines from the previous generation will be reused with a Dual VVT-i update for the three engines to increase power and torque. However, the car would hit the showrooms in October, 5 months after its official release.[40][41]
