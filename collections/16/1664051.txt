The title of the first season's fourth episode, "What's Going On?", refers to lyrics in the song "What's Up?" by the 4 Non Blondes, which was played in the episode during the main characters' first shared experience together.[205] A soundtrack album for the first season was released digitally by WaterTower Music on May 5, 2017. It includes 10 tracks by Klimek and Tykwer, and the licensed songs "What's Up?", "Kettering" by The Antlers, "Keep It Close" by Seven Lions and featuring Kerli, and "Dauðalogn" by Sigur Rós.[198] Klimek and Tykwer's compositions alone, are also available on WaterTower's YouTube channel.[206] Klimek commented on his and Tykwer's collaboration with the Wachowskis for the first season's score: "We would often just do a one-week mad writing session. It's a very collaborative process, and there's no ego involved."[202] Lana Wachowski called the score "its own unique script and it transports the viewer into the world of Sense8 in ways neither words nor images can".[198]
