Shortened by three inches from the previous Catalina wheelbase, the 118 in (3,000 mm) 1969 Grand Prix finally had its own body – and Pontiac's longest-ever hood.[11] Like all but the short-lived 1967 convertible, the new Grand Prix was a 2-door hardtop. Model names borrowed suggestive Duesenberg Model J nomenclature for "J" and "SJ" levels of trim.
