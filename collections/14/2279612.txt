Like other steamships of the era, Great Britain was provided with secondary sail power, consisting of one square-rigged and five schooner-rigged mastsâ€”a relatively simple sail plan designed to reduce the number of crew required. The masts were of iron, fastened to the spar deck with iron joints, and with one exception, hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in the event of a strong headwind. The rigging was of iron cable instead of the traditional hemp, again with a view to reducing wind resistance.[19] Another innovative feature was the lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around the main deck; a light iron railing [20] both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea.
