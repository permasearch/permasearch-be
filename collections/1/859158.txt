The Utawarerumono series was first released as a Japanese video game for the Windows on April 26, 2002 by Leaf and Aquaplus. A DVD-ROM edition was later released on December 12, 2003. Unlike most turn-based strategy games, the story is linear and there is no voice acting in the Windows version. A PlayStation 2 port, featuring a new battle system by Flight Plan (of the Summon Night series), was developed by Sting, and released on October 26, 2006 in Japan. The PS2 port included voice acting and several other changes to enhance gameplay. The adult graphics and scenes were removed from the PlayStation 2 version, which was rated for ages 15 and up. A PlayStation Portable version of the game was released on May 28, 2009.[6] A version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita is set to be released on April 26, 2018 in Japan. The game was never released outside Japan, however, a complete fan translation patch for the PC DVD version of Utawarerumono exists.[7]
