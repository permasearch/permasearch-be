Patriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived,[133] intending to root out neutrals or opponents to independence. Failure to do so meant possible imprisonment, exile, or even death.[134] American Tories were barred from public office, forbidden from practising medicine and law, forced to pay increased taxes, or even barred from executing wills or becoming guardians to orphans.[135][136] Congress enabled states to confiscate Loyalist property to fund the war.[137] Some Quakers who remained neutral had their property confiscated. States later prevented Loyalists from collecting any debts that they were owed.[138]
