People who are receiving oxygen therapy for low oxygen following an acute illness or hospitalization should not routinely have a prescription renewal for continued oxygen therapy without a physician's re-assessment of the person's condition.[21] If the person has recovered from the illness, then the hypoxemia is expected to resolve and additional care would be unnecessary and a waste of resources.[21]
