Less than two weeks after Louisville announced its departure for the ACC, multiple media reports indicated that the Big East's seven remaining non-FBS schools, all Catholic institutions, were considering a mass exit from the conference.[33][34][35][36] By December 13, it was likely that the non-FBS schools would indeed leave to form a new conference,[37] and on December 15, the seven schools (soon to be called the Catholic 7 by the media) made their departure official, effective with the 2015â€“16 school year.[38] Many details remained to be worked out, with one major issue being whether the "Big East" name would stay with the FBS schools.[39]
