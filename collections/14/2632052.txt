Many methods may be employed to mitigate or prevent the damage caused by expansive soils. When it comes to foundations, one solution is to extend building foundations to a depth where they are below the zone of water content fluctuation.[3] This supports them when the soil shrinks, and anchors them when the soil swells. Another solution is to remove the pre-existing expansive soil and replace it with a non-expansive soil,[7] but if the depth of the expansive soil is too deep, this option is very expensive. Maintaining a constant soil moisture is another solution, which sometimes may be achieved by allowing rainwater to properly drain away from the property, fixing areas around structures that have poor drainage qualities, fixing pipe leaks, avoiding over-watering nearby plants, and by planting trees some distance away from any structure.[7] Yet another solution is a process called soil stabilization, in which additional materials are added to the soil to limit its ability to shrink and swell.[7] Materials for stabilization include cement, resins, fly ash, lime, pozzolana, or lime-pozzolana mixture,[7] depending on the site conditions and the project goals.
