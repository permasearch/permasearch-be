At the launch of Skyrim, many technical issues of varying severity were reported. Some examples include a texture down-scaling issue on the Xbox 360 version when the game was run from the hard drive;[97] crashes, slowdown and frame rate issues on the PlayStation 3 version when save files exceeded 6Â MB,[98] commonly occurring due to extended gameplay times;[99] and various crashes and slowdowns on the Windows version. According to Skyrim's director Todd Howard, the notion that bugs were caused by "restrictive RAM"[100] is incorrect. Howard said, "It's literally the things you've done in what order and what's running."[101]
