Area code 445 was first proposed in July 2000 as an overlay with area codes 215 and 267.[2] However, these plans were delayed and then rescinded in 2003 by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.[3] The need for new phone numbers in area codes 215/267 was delayed until 2018. In December of 2016, it was announced that area code 445 will be activated as an additional overlay area code on March 3, 2018.[4]
