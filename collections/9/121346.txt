Several other people not involved in the conspiracy, but known or related to the conspirators, were also questioned. Northumberland's brothers, Sir Allen and Sir Josceline, were arrested. Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu had employed Fawkes at an early age, and had also met Catesby on 29Â October, and was therefore of interest; he was released several months later.[126] Agnes Wenman was from a Catholic family, and related to Elizabeth Vaux.[r] She was examined twice but the charges against her were eventually dropped.[128] Percy's secretary and later the controller of Northumberland's household, Dudley Carleton, had leased the vault where the gunpowder was stored, and consequently he was imprisoned in the Tower. Salisbury believed his story, and authorised his release.[129]
