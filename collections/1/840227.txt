In a minimum mode 8086-based system, the 8086 microprocessor is placed into minimum mode by strapping its MN/MX pin to logic high, i.e. +5V. In minimum mode, all control signals are generated by the 8086 microprocessor itself. Components in minimum mode are latches, trans-receiver, clock generator, memory and I/O device.
