In August 1989 the Shariat Appellate Bench struck down several more measures of the 1972 land reform law.[84] It ruled unanimously that provisions that allowed the confiscation of land without compensation were un-Islamic. On other measures it divided 3 to 2. It ruled that Waqf (an Islamic religious endowment, typically a donated plot of land or building) land was exempt from any provision of land reform laws; that the ceilings on amount of land owned were an undue restriction on property rights,[85] on the grounds that "Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be."[73][Note 8][86] Dissenting justices argued that under Islam the rights of property holder must be balanced against the needs of the community.[87] (The repudiation of a major feature of Ali Bhutto's domestic policies during the regime of his daughter underscoring judicial independence (i.e. power), and the weakness of the elected government.[85])
