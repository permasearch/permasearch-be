A new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care.[18] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944.[19] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office.[20][21][22] His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration.[23] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World WarÂ II, although president Batista suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its authoritarian regime.[24]
