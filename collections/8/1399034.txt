NGC 6826, the Blinking Planetary Nebula, is a planetary nebula with a magnitude of 8.5, 3200 light-years from Earth. It appears to "blink" in the eyepiece of a telescope because its central star is unusually bright[50] (10th magnitude).[1] When an observer focuses on the star, the nebula appears to fade out.[50] Less than one degree from the Blinking Planetary is the double star 16 Cygni.[1]
