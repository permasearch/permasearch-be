The game world is linear, with new stages being unlocked one after another. However, the player can go back and revisit previous stages to find new areas and items. The character's main base of operations is Metallia's house in Niblhenne Swamp, where they can save their game and access a basic merchant. If the player activates a Pillar in the field, they can warp directly to back to base and start at that Pillar when they re-enter the level.
