Charlotte Benkner (née Enterlein; November 16, 1889 – May 14, 2004)[94][95][96][97] was an American supercentenarian and the oldest verified living person from Elena Slough's death in 2003 until sufficient documentation was found to validate the age of Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan of Puerto Rico in March 2004.[94] The subsequent recognition of María Capovilla of Ecuador in December 2005 moved Benkner down to third place at the time of her death,[95][96]
