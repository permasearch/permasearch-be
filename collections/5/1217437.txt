On the original series, contestants could return until they either lost a game or won seven consecutive matches. On the CBS version, contestants played until they either won five consecutive matches or reached the network's winnings limit of $75,000 (which nobody ever reached). An unmentioned winnings limit, believed to be $60,000, existed on the 1986 syndicated series, as well as a rule that limited the number of cars a champion could win.
