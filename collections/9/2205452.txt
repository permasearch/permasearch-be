Enzymes with ping–pong mechanisms include some oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin peroxidase,[25] transferases such as acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase[26] and serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin.[27] Serine proteases are a very common and diverse family of enzymes, including digestive enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase), several enzymes of the blood clotting cascade and many others. In these serine proteases, the E* intermediate is an acyl-enzyme species formed by the attack of an active site serine residue on a peptide bond in a protein substrate. A short animation showing the mechanism of chymotrypsin is linked here.[δ]
