The first race held at the new Marina Bay Street Circuit was the 15th round of the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship, and was also the first night-time event in Formula One history.[2] The timing of the night event meant that it could be broadcast live at a convenient time for European TV audiences.[1] The track was also illuminated by a series of projectors which adapt their output to match the shape of the course.[15] On track, Felipe Massa was the first man to sit on the Singapore pole in his Ferrari, but the Brazilian blew that advantage with an early release from his first pit stop. The race was won by Fernando Alonso driving for the Renault team, however that result has since been tarnished by controversy.
