8.17 - Knowing that [a] thousand eras constitute a day of Brahman, [and a] thousand eras complete a night, are the people who know day, [and] night. 8.18 - On arrival of day, all manifestations originate from "Unmanifest"; On arrival of night they annihilate into [what is] known as "Unmanifest" only. 8.19 - This elementary world only happens again & again; Annihilates upon arrival of night, [and] originates upon arrival of day.
