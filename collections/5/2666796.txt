The song is in E dorian (i.e., an E minor scale with the sixth tone raised by a semitone), with open fifths in the accompaniment instead of chords, forming a pattern of E5-G5-D5-E5 twice in the verses.[4] The chorus uses this pattern twice, and then follows it with a pattern of E5-G5-A5-E5-D5-A5-E5-G5-A5-E5 as Bryan sings "Country girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me."[3] Clare Dunn sings backing vocals.[5]
