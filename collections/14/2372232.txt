The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects â€˜unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. (Shklovsky 16)
