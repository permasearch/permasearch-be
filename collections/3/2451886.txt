In season three, BoJack finds Kelsey at POFF (Pacific Ocean Film Festival) and attempts to reconcile with her through a note, but she cannot understand it because the ink starts to wash away. Later in the season, the two discuss doing a serious film together to legitimize BoJack as an actor. Unfortunately, this is part of a plan by Vanessa Gekko to sabotage Princess Carolyn. The resulting fallout seemingly ends BoJack's unique professional and artistic connection with Kelsey.
