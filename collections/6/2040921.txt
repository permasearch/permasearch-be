Although Stanley, just before the lights go out during the birthday party, "begins to strangle Meg (78), she has no memory of that the next morning, quite possibly because she had drunk too much and got tipsy (71–74); oblivious to the fact that Goldberg and McCann have removed Stanley from the house – Petey keeps that information from her when she inquires, "Is he still in bed?" by answering "Yes, he's ... still asleep"––she ends the play focusing on herself and romanticising her role in the party, "I was the belle of the ball. [...] I know I was” (102). For some, Petey’s final reply only makes dramatic sense if the framework of the whole play is in Meg’s mind, that her invention of Stan was ’necessary’ in an empty marriage, and what the audience has seen was a tragic ‘possible’ - no doubt to be followed by another narrative when her Stan ‘comes down’.[citation needed]
