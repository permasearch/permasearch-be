Priscilla notes that prescription drugs were present from the first time she visited Elvis in America. He took placidyls to get to sleep in ever-increasing doses. Elvis would wake up at his normal time around 4:00 in the afternoon, but would be groggy and irritable for a few hours from the heavy dose of pills. He then began taking Dexedrine in order to wake up.
