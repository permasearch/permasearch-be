A number of episodes referred to a practice of the administration having one day each year on which they accepted meetings with people or groups who would not normally receive an audience with high-level White House staffers, referring to the event as "Big Block of Cheese Day". The name came from the fact that President Andrew Jackson had a large wheel of cheese placed in the White House from which the public were invited to eat during a reception,[32] while discussing issues of the day with politicians.[33] In 2014, the White House announced that it was to host an online Q&A with Obama administration officials and staff, called a Virtual "Big Block of Cheese day", on January 29, 2014.[34] The event was promoted with a video featuring stars from The West Wing.[35] The event was repeated on January 21, 2015,[36] again promoted by stars from the show.[35]
