One night in 1966 after "sitting in" with blues singer John Lee Hooker in Yorkville, Clayton-Thomas left with him for New York. They played a Greenwich Village club for a couple of weeks, then Hooker left for Europe and Clayton-Thomas stayed on in New York City. He survived by playing "basket houses" where performers were given a few minutes of stage time and then passed the basket. Folk singer Judy Collins heard Clayton-Thomas one night at a club uptown and told her friend, drummer Bobby Colomby, about him. Bobby's band, Blood Sweat & Tears had broken up four months after releasing its debut Columbia album, "Child Is Father to the Man". Colomby was so impressed with Clayton-Thomas's vocal talent that he invited him to join the band. They took the reformed group into the Cafe Au Go Go in the Village.
