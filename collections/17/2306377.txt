Some of the more recently[when?] announced models include the Monaco V4 (the movement of which is driven by belts rather than gears);[16] the Carrera Calibre 360 (the first mechanical wrist chronograph to measure and display time to 1/100 of a second[17]) and the Monaco 69 (with both a digital chronograph accurate to a millisecond and a traditional mechanical movement, with a hinged mechanism allowing wearers to flip the watch between its two separate dials).[18]
