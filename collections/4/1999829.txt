"Celluloid Heroes" is a firm favorite among Kinks aficionados, and is regarded, lyrically and melodically, as one of Davies' most mature and moving works.[citation needed] The ballad is one of the few where the talent of John Gosling (on piano) is put at the front as a key element of the song. Former Animals keyboardist Dave Rowberry plays the Hammond organ. Building up on the initial D-major key, the harmonies of the verses proceed in a gradual exploration of several minor chords, until they culminate in an unexpected D7 chord preparing for the key change to G-major in the chorus.[citation needed]
