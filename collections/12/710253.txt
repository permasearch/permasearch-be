In 2005, a remix to Ol Dirty Bastard's "Pop Shots" was released on M.O.P.'s St. Marxmen mixtape. The track was recorded when M.O.P. and ODB were label mates on Roc-A-Fella records. In 2009, M.O.P. appeared on the compilation album Wu-Tang Chamber Music; the project was almost completely produced by Lil' Fame of M.O.P., under the moniker of Fizzy Womack, alongside RZA, The Revelations and others. The duo appeared on the track "Ill Figures" alongside Raekwon and Kool G. Rap; in 2011, they also guested on the title track for the compilation album Legendary Weapons, alongside Ghostface Killah and AZ. M.O.P. appears on a single for the soundtrack for "Man with the Iron Fists," on the track "Black Out" with Ghostface Killah and Pharoahe Monch, which is also produced by Lil' Fame.
