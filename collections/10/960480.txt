The directors admitted that they were not keen on hiring solely big-named, A-list celebrities[14] or top-billed actors to voice the film's main characters.[15] Howard explained that, in order to be cast, the actors simply had to have the "right voice" for the characters, preferring voice actors "who could ... bring a natural ease to those characters." Greno elaborated, "It was never about how big the star was ... It was always about ... whoâ€™s best for the part".[16] Film critic James Berardinelli of ReelViews observed that this decision echoed "Disney's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big name stars where often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents."[17] An additional asset was that the actor be able to perform well both independently and collaboratively.[16]
