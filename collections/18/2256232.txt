In past years, the lake levels have diminished due to a prolonged drought in Southwest Virginia and the geology that makes up the bottom of the lake.  In October 2008, the lake receded to a pond status.  During this time, the remains of Samuel Ira Felder were discovered in the bottom of the lake.  He drowned in July 1921 when he fell overboard while canoeing with friends.[5]
