Right from his childhood, he showed the yearning and deep commitment for the welfare of common masses when he took a brave step of nursing an old "Dalit (outcaste) and untouchable woman, suffering from leprosy against the strong disapproval and displeasure of his family. She used to work in their household and was called Chapko. Child Shriram was curious about her prolonged absence, when she did not show up for a few days. So he set out in her search towards the outskirts of the village. Dalit (outcaste) and untouchables' settlements were usually constructed on the outskirts of the villages. He found her in a terrible condition, screaming out in pain and agony, the screams suppressed due the lack of energy. Being devoid of food for many days,her condition was worse than that of animals---stripped of all human dignity. Everybody in that village including her family members had completely ignored her and left her to her fate. This situation of the old lady had shaken child Shriram. He decided to do all that was possible to help this old woman. He immediately called the local physicians and vaidyas (traditional Ayurvedic physicians), procured the medicines, did the dressings of her leprosy wounds. He took out time daily to bathe her, to apply medicine, dress her wounds and feed her. This was particularly remarkable during those days when the untouchability [Chhua-chhut] was very much prevalent and fear of leprosy disease was at its peak in the society. This particular event in his early life was significant as it showed his concerns and unadulterated love and affection for the whole of humanity. It highlights his belief in the "Karma", or the theory of Right-Action in life.
