But on the next play, he took off for a 67-yard touchdown run in which he broke seven tackles en route to the end zone. the crowd in Seattle was so loud during the run that local seismographs recorded it as a small earthquake.[1] With 1:52 left, Brees struck back with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henderson, but the 2-point conversion failed, keeping the score at 41â€“36. Then Carlson sealed the victory by recovering Hartley's onside kick attempt, enabling Seattle to run out the clock.
