The original Fiterman Hall opened as an office building in 1959 and occupied a block bounded by Greenwich Street, Barclay Street, West Broadway, and Park Place.[148] It was donated to BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman, for whom the building was subsequently named.[149][150] In 2000, the State of New York Dormitory Authority, which owned the building, began a massive renovation to better adapt the building for classroom use.[151] During the September 11 attacks in 2001, Fiterman Hall's structure was severely damaged by debris from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. The renovation was never completed, and the building was condemned and demolished in 2008.[151] After a series of delays, a new building designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners[152] broke ground in December 2009[153] and was completed in 2012.[151][154]
