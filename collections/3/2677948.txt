The cranial endoskeleton of T. roseae shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in T. roseae compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.[1] The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.[1]
