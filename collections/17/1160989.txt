The Mitchells have always been a power force in the soap; Phil and Grant's mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), was landlady of the local pub, The Queen Victoria, intermittently from 1994 to 2010. In 2010, EastEnders celebrated Windsor's exit from the soap with "Queen Vic Fire Week", which saw a fire engulf the long-standing pub, risking the lives of Walford regulars including Peggy and Phil. In 2016 Barbara Windsor, Ross Kemp and Danniella Westbrook briefly reprised their roles as Peggy, Grant and Sam as part of a major storyline which would see matriarch Peggy killed off.
