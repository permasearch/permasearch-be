Waterloo Road has had nine deputy headteachers including Jason Done as long-standing English teacher turned deputy head Tom Clarkson, Jaye Jacobs as intelligent and sexy Sian Diamond and Neil Morrissey as charismatic and inspirational Eddie Lawson. Jamie Glover made two other appearances as original deputy head Andrew Treneman, after he left his post. Tom, George Windsor and Nikki Boston (Done, Angus Deayton and Heather Peace) were the only deputy headteachers to have not been deputy headteachers throughout all their time at Waterloo Road.
