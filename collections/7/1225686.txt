Gay liberation (considered a precursor of various modern LGBT social movements) was known for its links to the counterculture of the time (e.g. groups like the Radical Faeries), and for the gay liberationists' intent to transform or abolish fundamental institutions of society such as gender and the nuclear family;[23] in general, the politics were radical, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist in nature.[24] In order to achieve such liberation, consciousness raising and direct action were employed.[23]
