Meanwhile, the FBI has dug up the antifreeze used to dissolve Jack in the first movie, attempting to test it for remains of the genetic material. One of the janitors (Brett A. Boydstun) accidentally spills a cup of coffee into the tank of antifreeze, waking Jack up and causing him to reform and break free. He heads for the tropics, due to the idea that since Sam was wounded by Jack (voiced by Scott MacDonald, who reprises his role) in the first movie, and his blood dripped into the antifreeze used to dissolve him, Jack is linked to Sam's psyche.
