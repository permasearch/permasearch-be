According to popular tradition, the gravestone of Elizabeth Pain in Boston's King's Chapel Burying Ground was the inspiration for Hester Prynne's grave.[2] Scholar Laurie Rozakis has argued that an alternate or additional source for the story may be Hester Craford, a woman flogged for fornication with John Wedg.[3] Another story claims that Hester was the modeled after Mary Bachiler Turner (4th wife of well known Colonial minister Stephen Bachiler) whose life in colonial Maine bore a striking resemblance to Hester's tale.[4][5]
