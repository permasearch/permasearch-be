In June 2014, Hotz[28] published a root exploit software hack for Samsung Galaxy S5 devices used in the US market.[29] The exploit is itself built around Linux kernel CVE-2014-3153,[30][31] which was discovered by hacker Pinkie Pie, and it involves an issue in the Futex subsystem that in turn allows for privilege escalation. The exploit, known as towelroot, was designated a "one-click Android rooting tool"[31] by the hacking community because it was designed to be installed quickly like an App; other rooting hacks were typically uploaded from a nearby PC with a cable and necessitated rebooting the device with a special set of key presses.
