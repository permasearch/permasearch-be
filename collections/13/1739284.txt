The frequency of data loss and the impact can be greatly mitigated by taking proper precautions, those of which necessary can vary depending on the type of data loss. For example, multiple power	 circuits with battery backup and a generator only protect against power failures, though using an Uninterruptable Power Supply can protect your drive against sudden power spikes. Similarly, using a journaling file system and RAID storage only protect against certain types of software and hardware failure. For hard disk drives, which are a physical storage medium, ensuring minimal vibration and movement will help protect against damaging the components internally, as can maintaining a suitable drive temperature.[4]
