Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker William Penn. The main population elements included Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.[57] Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.[58]
