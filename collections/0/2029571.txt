Wallenda performs without a safety net or harness. "My great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a false sense of security," he explains.[20]  He notes that a safety net is no guarantee – an uncle was killed while performing despite falling into a safety net.  However, he says he does not have a "death wish in any way.  I plan on living and dying a natural death when I'm old."[14]  Asked about fear, he remarked "I would say the only thing I fear is God".[21]  He adds that his Christian faith allows him to "know where I'm going to go when I die ... I'm not scared of dying."[15]
