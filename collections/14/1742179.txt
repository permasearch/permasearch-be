The fourth section includes a list of petitions ending te rogamus audi nos (we beseech you to hear us) from which the appropriate prayers can be chosen for a particular occasion, but always ending with petitions for the whole church, for the ministers of the Church, for the lay faithful and for all humanity. The rubrics printed before the litany indicate that other petitions “suitable to the occasion” and in the form proper to the Litany may be added “at the proper place”.
