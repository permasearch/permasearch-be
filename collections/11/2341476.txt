2012 began like Ortiz had his sights set on MVP contention again, as he hit .405 over the season's first month, with 6 home runs and 20 RBI. On July 4, at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Ortiz hit his 400th career home run off of A. J. Griffin of the Oakland Athletics. However, on July 16, Ortiz suffered an injury to his right Achilles tendon and was placed on the DL on July 19. He returned on August 24, but returned to the DL on August 27 after playing just 1 game. He finished the season with 23 home runs and 60 RBIs while batting .318 in 90 games. On the date of his injury, the Red Sox were 46-44. However, without Ortiz, the Red Sox cratered, going 23-49 over the last two and a half months of the season to finish last in the AL East.
