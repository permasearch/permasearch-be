In The Shrew, these lines are spoken by Katherina near the end of the play. Petruchio's response is to beat her and anally rape her as his "gang" hold her down.[107] As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when they come back up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio.[108] As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse."[73] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls.[104] Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony.[109] Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [and to] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic."[110] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.[111]
