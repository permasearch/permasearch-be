Oregon voters amended the Constitution in 1914, to repeal the death penalty, by a margin of 50.04%. The repeal was an initiative of Governor Oswald West.[12] However, the death penalty was restored in 1920 with 56% of voters favoring its use.[13] From 1864 to 1931, executions were carried out by hanging.[13] However, beginning with the execution of LeRoy Hershel McCarthy, on January 30, 1939, Oregon began using lethal gas in gas-chamber executions.[14] The state executed seventeen men in this manner.[13] The last of these gas-inhalation executions took place on 20 August 1962, with the execution of Leeroy Sanford McGahuey.[13] In 1964 voters passed Measure 1, a constitutional amendment prohibiting capital punishment, with 60% of voters approving. Governor Mark Hatfield commuted the sentences of three death row inmates two days later.[13]
