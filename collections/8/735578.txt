"Iris" is a song by American alternative rock band Goo Goo Dolls. Originally written for the soundtrack of the 1998 film City of Angels, the song was later included on the band's sixth album Dizzy Up the Girl. "Iris" has contributed greatly to the band's success. The song's time signature alternates between 4 4 and 6 8, and features an unusual guitar tuning in which most of the strings are tuned to D, lending the guitar a chorus-like effect.
