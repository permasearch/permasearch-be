While Khyber struggles to control his dog's transformations, Dr. Psychobos tells Malware that he will need a part of the Omnitrix to fix it. This causes Dr. Psychobos to infiltrate the Plumber's base on Earth and steal a part from Ben's Omnitrix causing it to malfunction. The malfunctioning of the Omnitrix causes its powers to leak into Psyphon, Bubble Helmet, Fistina, and Liam giving them abilities very similar to the Omnitrix aliens.
