In his review of the single, Patrick Brennan of Hot Press declared "Only Happy When It Rains" his Single of the Fortnight, writing: "It's hugely refreshing to come across a song which celebrates all those sad moments of loneliness that can be so life affirming",[16]. Billboard's Larry Flick described the song as "solid all the way through", praising the overall production.[17] A reviewer for Kerrang! wrote, "A truly inspired single... Garbage combine a slightly sinister acidic approach with an infectious melodic atmosphere and an alternative punch. The result is awesome,"[18] and a reviewer for Music Week stated that "Shirley Manson's vocals veer between fuzzy darkness, grinding catchy and crystal brilliance."[19] Alastair Mabbot, writing for The List, described the song as "Spitting Image's notion of alternative rock".[20]
