Reason:  Both verses 44 and 46 are duplicates of verse 48, which remains in the text.  Verses 44 and 46 are both lacking in א,B,C,L,ƒ1, and some mss of the ancient versions, but appear in somewhat later sources such as A,D,K,θ, some Italic mss and the Vulgate. The UBS text assigns this omission a confidence rating of A.
