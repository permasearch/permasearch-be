The 289 NPA overlay was approved by the CRTC on August 15, 2000 (Order CRTC 2000-772). Earlier that month, Toufic Saliba, consultant and technical engineer at the Commission, directed the addition of area code 289 in the 905 area code region. In doing so, Saliba directed that all carriers put in place a 10-digit dialing plan for all local calls. In this order, the Commission directed Bell Canada to implement the 10-digit local dialing plan.[5] 289 came into service on April 7, 2001, and was in full operation by June 9, 2001.
