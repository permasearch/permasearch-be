Buss and Schmitt[32] highlight that although long term mating relationships is common for humans, it is not characteristic of all mating relationships: there is both short term and long term mating relationships. Buss and Schmitt provided a Sexual Strategies Theory which predicts the two sexes have evolved distinct psychological mechanisms which underlie the strategies utilised for short and long term mating. This theory is directly relevant and compatible with the two already mentioned theories Life History and Parental Investment.[33][34] Males tend to appear orientated towards short term mating (greater desire for short term mates than women, prefer larger number of sexual partners and take less time to consent to sexual intercourse[34]) and this appears to solve a number of adaptive problems including using less resources to access a mate.[32] Although there is a number of reproductive advantages to short term mating, males still pursue long term mates and this is due to the possibility of monopolising a female's lifetime reproductive resources.[32] Consistent with findings, for both short term and long term mates, males prefer younger females (reproductively valuable).[32][35]
