Iron Maiden's World Slavery Tour began in Warsaw, Poland on 9 August 1984[5] and lasted 331 days,[6] during which 187 concerts were performed[7] To tie in with their 1984 album, Powerslave,[8] the tour's stage show adhered to an ancient Egyptian theme, which was decorated with sarcophagi and Egyptian hieroglyphs, and mummified representations of the band's mascot, Eddie, in addition to numerous pyrotechnic effects.[9] The theatricality of the stage show meant that it would become one of the band's most acclaimed tours, making it the perfect backdrop to their first live double album and concert video.[10]
