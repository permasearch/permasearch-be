Caddy Works was the head coach of the Bruins from 1921 to 1939, guiding them to a 173-159 record. Works was a lawyer by profession and coached the team only during the evenings. According to UCLA player and future Olympian Frank Lubin, Works was "more of an honorary coach" with little basketball knowledge.[8] Wilbur Johns was the UCLA basketball head coach from 1939 to 1948, guiding the Bruins to a 93-120 record.
