Law breaking behaviour in which the individuals are putting themselves or others at risk is considered anti-social even if it is not consistent or stable (ExamplesÂ : speeding, use of drugs, getting in physical conflict). In relation to the previous statement, juvenile delinquency is a core element to the diagnosis of ASPD.[37] Individuals who begin getting in trouble with the law (in more than one area) at an abnormally early age (around 15)[38] and keep recurrently doing so in adulthood may be suspected of having ASPD.
