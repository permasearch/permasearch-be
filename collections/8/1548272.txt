On July 17, 2015, Nintendo won a patent suit filed against eight of its handheld consoles, including the 3DS.[195] The suit was originally filed by the Quintal Research Group after it secured a patent for a "computerized information retrieval system" in 2008.[196] On March 17, 2018, the United States Appeals Court determined Nintendo had not violated Tomita's patent.[197]
