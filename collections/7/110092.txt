The results show aired on Wednesday, September 8, 2010 (1 hour) and featured performances from Sarah McLachlan and the cast of American Idiot, determining who made the top four spots in the finals.[13] Singing sensation Susan Boyle, who was a contestant on the third series of Got Talent's sister show Britain's Got Talent, was scheduled to perform at the results show but was not able to. The producers of the show had not been given the rights to the song from Lou Reed, and Boyle was pulled from the episode at the last minute.[14]
