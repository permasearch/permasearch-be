Angela and Hodgins met when Angela was brought on to work at the Jeffersonian by Brennan. While initially on good terms, they grew closer throughout season one. At the beginning of season two, Hodgins became obviously interested in her, and pursued her more openly. After a few episodes of palpable sexual tension, Hodgins finally asked Angela on a date in the episode "The Girl with the Curl". While their date was quite successful, Angela broke it off fearing repercussions if things went badly. Later, after Hodgins was rescued from being buried alive, they kissed, and at the end of the episode they went home together. Angela later asked Hodgins if she could sleep at his place one night after being spooked by restored video footage, and soon they were openly involved. After refusing Hodgins' marriage proposal twice, she proposed to him.[10] Their wedding was cut short in the season two finale when it was revealed that Angela was technically married to a man from Fiji, Grayson Barasa.[11] Their relationship ended after a lengthy search for her husband, and issues regarding Jack's trust of Angela.[12]
