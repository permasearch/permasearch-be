Different types of radioactive decay are characterized by their changes in mass number as well as atomic number, according to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy. For example, uranium-238 usually decays by alpha decay, where the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle. Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2 (Z: 92→90, N: 146→144), so that the mass number decreases by 4 (A = 238→234); the result is an atom of thorium-234 and an alpha particle (4 2He2+):[3]
