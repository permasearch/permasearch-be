Infinite also implements the Infinity Stones as a gameplay mechanic, similar to Marvel Super Heroes, where each stone grants unique abilities.[4] Before the match begins, players select one of the six Infinity Stones.[12] Each Infinity Stone bestows one ability that can be activated at any time, known as the "Infinity Surge".[5][12] For example, the Power Stone produces a knockback effect when used, while the Space Stone pulls an opponent closer to the player character.[1] A second, stronger ability called the "Infinity Storm" can be activated after players fill their Infinity meter at least halfway, giving them a significant boost for a limited time, similar to the X-Factor system from Marvel vs. Capcom 3.[1] The boost is determined by the chosen Infinity Stone; for example, the Power Stone increases the user's damage output and combo ability, while the Space Stone traps an opponent within a confined area that severely limits their movement.[1][5]
