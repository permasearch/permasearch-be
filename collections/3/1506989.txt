Under colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes,[269][270] most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway.[271] The water is filtered at Bhandup,[271] which is Asia's largest water filtration plant.[272][273][274] India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.[275][276]
