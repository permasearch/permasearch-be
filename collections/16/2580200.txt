In 2004, Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2 billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (InformationWeek – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.[56] Oracle Corporation's main competitors in the database arena remain IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata[56], with open-source databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant[57] share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has recently[update] made inroads[58] by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features[clarification needed] at a much lower price-point.
