Between 2015 and 2018 (first assessment Summer 2017), A Levels in England are being reformed, transitioning from a modular to linear structure (initially across 13 subjects). This means all A Level exams must be sat in one sitting as a set of terminal exams (3 exams for the majority of subjects), and there is less emphasis on coursework. An example of this can be seen in Edexcel's new English Literature A Level, reformed in 2015, which reduces the amount of coursework to 20% (from 40% in the old modular specification). Additionally, A Levels are no longer separated into units, and students must resit all of their exams if they wish to resit the qualification. While these reforms were expected to be complete in 2017, this has been extended to 2018 to include the reforms of less common languages such as Modern Hebrew, Bengali among others.
