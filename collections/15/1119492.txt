An exception-handling language without this unwinding is Common Lisp with its Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler and does not unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation at exactly the same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.
