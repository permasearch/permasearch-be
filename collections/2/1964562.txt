The city of Detroit Lakes was founded by Colonel George Johnston in 1871.  The city grew quickly with the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad.  In 1877, an election finally decided that Detroit Lakes, then known as Detroit, was to become the county seat.  Detroit won the election by a ninety percent majority.  The nearby cities of Frazee, Lake Park, and Audubon were also in the running for the county seat.  By 1884, Detroit Lakes had many businesses, including the Hotel Minnesota, the Lakes Hotel, a bank, a newspaper, and an opera house.  The first county courthouse was built in Detroit Lakes that year also. Some of the city's historic buildings still stand, such as the railroad station, and the historic Holmes Theater. The Becker County Museum, located near the Holmes Theater in Detroit Lakes, has a large amount of information and exhibits on the history of the city and the surrounding area.
