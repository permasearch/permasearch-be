A table, known as the cupboard (pronounced "cubboard"), in the Middle Temple Hall (in London) is also reputed to have been made from the wood of Golden Hind. Upon the cupboard is placed the roll of members of Middle Temple, which new members sign when they are called to the Bar. The ship's lantern was hung in the vestibule of Middle Temple Hall but was destroyed during the Second World War.[citation needed]
