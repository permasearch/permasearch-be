Onsager (1944) obtained the following analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the anisotropic square lattice when the magnetic field     h = 0   {\displaystyle h=0}   in the thermodynamic limit as a function of temperature and the horizontal and vertical interaction energies      J  1     {\displaystyle J_{1}}   and      J  2     {\displaystyle J_{2}}  , respectively
