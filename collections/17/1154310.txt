Although we don't know much about her, we do know that she is obsessed with Giovanni and buys him expensive gifts to get him to like her (they also dated for some time). She is good friends with Lola and Bianca, and like Bianca, she lets Lola make all decisions for her. Her father made her stop dating Giovanni. She is seen as the naive girl and soon learns about Giovanni flirting with other girls, so she begins flirting with Iñaki, much to Giovanni's dismay. She acts like they're friends until the La Gran Final when she makes out with Iñaki right in front of Giovanni and Lola.
