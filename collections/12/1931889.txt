The song was not originally intended to be a Styx track, but Styx members James "J.Y." Young and Tommy Shaw convinced DeYoung to put the song on Cornerstone. As a result, DeYoung's demo was placed on Cornerstone with Shaw overdubbing a guitar solo in the song's middle section. The track became a major hit, reaching #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and was their only major UK hit single, reaching #6. In 1999, "Babe" was included in the soundtrack to the movie Big Daddy, starring Adam Sandler, whose character is a huge fan of Styx.
