Judge Horton called the first case against Haywood Patterson and began jury selection. Leibowitz objected that African-American jurors had been excluded from the jury pool. He called the jury commissioner to the stand, asking if there were any blacks on the juror rolls, and when told yes, suggested his answer was not honest.[59] The locals resented his questioning of the official and "chewed their tobacco meditatively."[63] The National Guard posted five men with fixed bayonets in front of Leibowitz's residence that night.[63]  The jury was selected by the end of the day on Friday and sequestered in the Lyons Hotel.[63]
