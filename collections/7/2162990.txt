Williams also performed the song solo, on the Take the Crown Stadium Tour in 2013. When playing at Wembley Stadium, he replaced the lyric "Someday this will all be someone else's dream" with "this will be Justin Bieber's dream..." and continued, "I don't think so! He's a good singer and he's got a lovely haircut... I should shut up now before I get into too much trouble." to thunderous applause from the audience.[3]
