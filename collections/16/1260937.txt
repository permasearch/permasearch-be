In the event, the "bouncy castle" idea was superseded by a net strung between large arms, and SpaceX was still working to perfect the fairing landing and recovery approach in February 2018. The net, installed on Mr. Steven (a fast platform supply vessel equipped with dynamic positioning systems), was tested on the launch of the Paz satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E in that month.[128][129] This mission was also the first to use a versionÂ 2 fairing, explicitly designed to "improve survivability for post-launch recovery attempts, and to be reusable on future missions".[130]. This recovery attempt was not fully successful; the fairing missed the boat by a few hundred meters but landed intact in the water[131] before being recovered and taken back to port.[129]
