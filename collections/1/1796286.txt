Vaginectomy is surgery to remove all or part of the vagina, and is usually used as a treatment for vaginal cancer.[122] The vulva or vagina may be altered in the case of gynecologic cancers (such as cervical cancer, vaginal cancer or vulvar cancer). Removal of some or all of the reproductive organs and genitalia can result in damage to the nerves and leave behind scarring or adhesions.[123] Sexual function may also be impaired as a result, as in the case of some cervical cancer surgeries, which impact vaginal lubrication, elasticity, pain, and sexual arousal. This mostly resolves after one year of recovery, but remedying vaginal dryness and decreased sexual satisfaction may take longer.[123]
