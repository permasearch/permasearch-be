Before he leaves, Percy is given Chiron's magic sword Anaklusmos and Luke's flying sneakers. The trio then travels towards Los Angeles, the entrance to Hades's realm. Along the way, they are attacked by the Furies, Medusa, Echidna and the Chimera, and several other monsters. Percy gradually learns more about his companions, his powers, and the world of the Greek gods. Along the way, they do a favor for the god Ares, who gives them a backpack full of supplies and transportation to Nevada. When they arrive in Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into Tartarus by Percy's flying shoes. The battered group finally meet Hades, who reveals that his Helm of Darkness (his symbol of power) has been stolen too. Hades accuses Percy of stealing his helm and threatens to kill Sally Jackson (who has been the god's hostage the whole time) and release all the dead back into the real world unless it is returned. When Percy finds the missing master bolt inside his backpack, the group realizes that Ares has been manipulating them. Narrowly escaping the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel. When the demigod wins, he gives the Helm of Darkness to the Furies; Hades then realizes that Percy was not the thief and returns Mrs. Jackson to their apartment in New York.
