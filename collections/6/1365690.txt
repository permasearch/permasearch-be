Partway through the round, a lightning effect played in the office signaling the start of the Lightning Round. Three questions, each with three choices, were asked to the gumshoes, all related to the area mentioned in the previous question. Buzzing in with the correct answer was worth 5 Crime Bucks. After the Lightning Round, Greg was called into the Chief's office for a brief conversation. This was used as a comedy break, during which the Chief and Greg would either announce that the gumshoe who captures Carmen would win a grand-prize trip (Seasons 1 and 2) or describe a home viewer contest in which viewers submitted the names and locations of the items stolen in four episodes for a chance to win a Carmen Sandiego T-shirt (Seasons 3-5).
