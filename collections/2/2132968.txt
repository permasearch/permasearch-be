Vass originated as a stop on the Seaboard Railway as a station called Bynum. It was primarily a place with a siding to load lumber, turpentine and resin from the local area.  In 1877, the town's name was changed from Bynum to Winder, in honor of Major John C. Winder general manager of the Seaboard Railroad. In 1892 its name was again changed to Vass, honoring Major William Worrell Vass, who was at that time paymaster for the Seaboard Railroad.  Vass remained as only a stopping place for the local train until 1907, when it was incorporated with Mr. Alex Gunter as mayor.[5]  During the 1910's the town took on new life and through the efforts of some great men, like Mr. Angus Cameron, and the town began to grow into a thriving community.[6]
