The Medic Droid was started in 2005 with Chris Donathon, Hector Bagnod and Johnny Chavez (Droid).[1] Bagnod and Donathon first met in 2003, but Donathon moved away from the city after they met, only to return (and begin the band) a few years later. The group gained a strong initial following through the social networking site Myspace; by mid-2008 the song "Fer Sure" had logged almost 2 million plays on the site[2] and the group had accumulated over 100,000 friends there.[3] Soon they were noticed by manager Avery Andon[4] who brought the band to New York where they played their first live show opening for Enter Shikari at The Bowery Ballroom[5] and caught the eye of A&R's from Epic Records who would later go on to sign the band. The group eventually made two new songs "Keeping Up with the Joneses" and "FSCENE8", enlisting the help of Australian DJ S3RL to remix these songs. In late 2007, Johnny Droid left the band due to issues with the other members and created his own solo band called J0hnny.[6] In 2011, he announced he was making a band with S3RL called R0bots.[7]
