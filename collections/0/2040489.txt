The DPRK has had a strong relationship with Angola from the time of Angola's struggle for independence. It is estimated that 3,000 DPRK troops and a thousand advisers took part in the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, and fighting against the apartheid South African military.[17] In 2011, Angola purchased naval patrol boats from the DPRK.[69]
