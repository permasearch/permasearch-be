The European colonization of the Americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the Americas by various European powers. Starting in either the 10th or 11th century, West Norse sailors explored and briefly settled on the shores of present-day Canada, according to Icelandic Sagas, but violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately led to the Norse abandoning those settlements.[1]
