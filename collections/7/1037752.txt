The song, originally titled "What Ever Happened to Saturday Night?", was written by Richard O'Brien for the original stage production. The song was intended for its author, Richard O'Brien, to sing in, but director Jim Sharman convinced O'Brien to portray the character of Riff Raff instead of Eddie. Its high vocal range had not yet been accomplished by any other actor performing the character and the arrangement had to be altered until Meat Loaf took the part in the Los Angeles production in 1974. Meat Loaf reprised the role from his debut in the Roxy Theatre run of the Rocky Horror Show and the film.
