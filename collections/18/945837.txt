The history of the Black Panther Party is controversial. Scholars have characterized the Black Panther Party as the most influential black movement organization of the late 1960s, and "the strongest link between the domestic Black Liberation Struggle and global opponents of American imperialism".[22] Other commentators have described the Party as more criminal than political, characterized by "defiant posturing over substance".[23]
