For major depressive disorder, ECT is generally used only when other treatments have failed, or in emergencies, such as imminent suicide.[4][16][17][18] ECT has also been used in selected cases of depression occurring in the setting of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, developmental delay, brain arteriovenous malformations and hydrocephalus.[19]
