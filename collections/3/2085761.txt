In 1985, Monsanto acquired G. D. Searle & Company, a life sciences company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex,[37][38] which in 1998 became the first selective COXâ€‘2 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[39] Celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.[40]
