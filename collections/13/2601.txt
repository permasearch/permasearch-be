Alexia "Lexi" Branson was a vampire and Stefan's best friend and companion. She had known Stefan and his brother Damon for over a century. Damon killed her to make the town council think that she was the vampire terrorizing Mystic Falls. Lexi returned as a ghost to help save Stefan. She later choked Damon for killing her but let him go. She and Stefan stayed together for the most part drinking and later parting on good terms. Through flashbacks when Damon was killing people in New York as "Son of Sam", Stefan sent Lexi to help Damon. For about 6 months they hung out while Lexi would ask Damon about Katherine, trying to help him remember love. One night Damon claimed that he didn't love Katherine and that he had fallen for Lexi, and they had a night of wild sex; the next morning he locked her on a rooftop with the sun coming up as punishment for her spying. She came back for a scene at the end of the series finale, where Stefan hugs her.
