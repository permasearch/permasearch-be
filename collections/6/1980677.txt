In the year 2000, after rather long stints in Parisian design companies, Clément Derock and Frédéric Lalande got together to create a design company that was the first of its kind in France. It combined separate skill sets – new Internet-related technology, mixed media branding and traditional design skills – to create a truly new agency, “Seenk”. Based on the belief that métissage or crossbreeding is crucial to the evolution of species, Seenk adopted mixed media as a part of each of their branding or communication exercise at a time when no other company was doing so. The consequence of this constant attempt at merger of media was that a new breed of designers came into their own and flourished. This was a breed of designers that did not exist before due to the gap that existed in design education - a gap between academia and the professional world. That’s why Clément and Fréderic tied up with Patrick Felices, experimented in the field of graphic design education. Patrick had been the Dean of a noted Paris based design school for many years before he took on the mantle of co-founder and Dean at école intuit.lab.
