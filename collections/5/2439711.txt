System Development Corporation updated Air Defense Command satellite information processing systems for $15,850,542 on January 19, 1973.[1][25] The improvements were primarily to the Space Computational Center's displays and application software, which was updated to provide real-time positioning of orbiting space systems for the NORAD Combat Operation Center. The first phase, which established a system integrator and modernized the communications to a major data processing system, was completed in October 1972.[25]
