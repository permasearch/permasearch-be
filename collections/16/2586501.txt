In the past, breeder-reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding-ratios, from 1.01 for the Shippingport Reactor[21][22] running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the Soviet BN-350 liquid-metal-cooled reactor.[23] Theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements ("tube-in-shell" construction) suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible on an industrial scale.[24] The Soviet BR-1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 2.5 under non-commercial conditions.[25]
