Due to acting commitments, Fehr never appeared in Bones after season 5. The character was "killed off" in the season 11 premiere, "The Loyalty in the Lie". It was revealed that Jared and his wife Padme had been separated for several months. Padme was resentful of Dr. Brennan as the latter had told Seeley to stop giving money to Jared, knowing that Jared would spend it on alcohol. Jared had been in debt at that time and he never reconciled with Padme prior to his death. Seeley had attempted to help his brother but was instead forced to watch Jared's corpse burn after things went south. It took detached forensic work on the part of Dr. Brennan to discover that Jared's skeleton was not that of her missing husband, Seeley Booth.
