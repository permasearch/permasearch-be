It is commonly assumed that the PHOSITA (or its European equivalent) in the non-obviousness provision and in the disclosure provision are the same person. Raising the non-obviousness bar (as has been proposed by people concerned about "trivial patents" being granted) therefore implies that the requirements for disclosure are lowered: if more inventions are considered "trivial", the PHOSITA is apparently considered smarter, so they do not need an elaborate disclosure. Some writers therefore have proposed to "decouple" the PHOSITA.[13]
