The next day, Melissa receives a phone call from the person who owned the car they stole. He then calls Melissa "Goldilocks" (she is blonde), revealing that he can see her. He also tells her, "I believe you have something of mine, 'cause I now have something of yours," soon after Bobby disappears from a diner restroom. The others find a CB radio in their car, with which Rusty Nail talks to them. He orders them to destroy their cellphones and follow his orders if Bobby is to survive, and he has some quite nasty psychological mind games that create a bridge for gory, life-and-death situations. The group continues to follow Rusty Nail, who promises them that they will be all reunited soon, after Rusty requests for Kayla's middle finger, a reference to when Kayla flipped off the driver of a truck who turned out to be Rusty. The group cuts a finger from a corpse and reach the wrong trucker because Rusty already knew that they had broken the rules. Rusty cuts one finger off Bobby and puts it in the glove compartment of the vehicle, which is eventually discovered by the group.
