Sugar and Kim are at the pier, and she now remembers what really happened the night she was with Tom. Tom had ejacuated before they even got their clothes off. She says how if Kim could stand the premature ejaculations, she and Tom would probably be a good couple. Kim says she's not jealous, and says that Tom is definitely not her type. Sugar jokingly suggests perhaps she is more Kim's type, and Kim doesn't reject this claim. Sugar then realises that Kim has feelings for her, and Kim leaves abruptly. Sugar is left on her own to think as Kim walks through home through Brighton.
