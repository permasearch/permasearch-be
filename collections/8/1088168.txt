Boroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most Pennsylvania cities having been incorporated as a borough before being incorporated as a city.[131] There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which are governed by the "weak mayor" form of mayor–council government.[130][131] The largest borough in Pennsylvania is State College (41,992) and the smallest is Centralia (7).
