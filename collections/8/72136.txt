Real Madrid were invited to the championship in January 2000 in Brazil, by virtue of winning the 1998 Intercontinental Cup the previous season. The club finished fourth overall, after losing the third place play-off on penalties to Mexico's Club Necaxa. They initially qualified for the 2001 tournament, in their native Spain, but the competition was cancelled before it started.
