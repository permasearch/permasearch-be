Mirage, voiced by Bebe Neuwirth, is one of Aladdin's recurring enemies and the second main antagonist in the TV series Aladdin. A cat-like enchantress (with similarities to both Egyptian goddesses Bast and Sekhmet) holding powers over illusions, dreams and shadows, her magic powers are enough to create a mirage of Agrabah, its people and Aladdin's friends. This, combined with her stunning keenness and ruthlessness, makes her a dangerous enemy. Her home (called Morbia) appears to be a giant hollow sphinx floating in a dark night sky along with numerous asteroid-like floating rocks drifting aimlessly about. Mirage is inscrutable in her motives. She never provides any insight herself, and other evidence is circumstantial at best. It is possible that she intends to kill Aladdin and his friends and then take over Agrabah (or the world); she certainly attempts the former several times; however, she is called "Evil Incarnate" during the course of the series, and it is possible that all of her actions are motivated simply by malice. The only reliable evidence is from the mysterious blind magician Phasir, who appears in few episodes of the series and who seems to have some history with Mirage, though it is not expanded on.
