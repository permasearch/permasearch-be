Estimates later showed that Cowboys & Aliens and The Smurfs were tied at the number one spot for the weekend with $36.2 million each.[29] However, actual figures showed Cowboys & Aliens won the weekend with $36.4 million just beating The Smurfs' $35.6 million. The Smurfs' opening was still stronger than anticipated since some box office analysts predicted that it would open below $30 million.[30] For its second weekend the film remained at number two with Rise of the Planet of the Apes taking Cowboys & Aliens' spot.[31] It made $20.7 million (41% being from 3D showings), a 42% decrease from it opening weekend.[32]
