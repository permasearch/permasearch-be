As Sister and Sparkle arrive home, their sister Delores/Dee (Tika Sumpter) opens the door and they sneak upstairs to their room to avoid having their mother hear them come in. Emma (Whitney Houston), the girls' mother, walks into the girls' room and notices Sparkle, Sister and Dee in bed together, and demands that Sister and Sparkle prepare for bed and be ready for church in the morning. The next morning while at church Stix along with his cousin Levi (Omari Hardwick) spot Sister and Sparkle sitting in the choir. Levi tells Stix that Sister and Sparkle are siblings with musical talent, and Levi is interested in meeting Sister. After church Stix and Sparkle meet and talk for a while, as Emma notices and looks on disapprovingly. Ms. Waters (Tamela Mann) Emma's friend points out that Emma's oldest daughter Sister is almost 30, and due to a bad situation in New York City was forced to move back to Detroit to live with Emma. Later that night Emma hosts a Bible study at her home in which both Levi and Stix are present. However, Levi takes the time to make a date with Sister who is uninterested and not participating in her mother's Bible study. After Emma and everyone leave the house, Stix secretly stays behind and notices Sparkle playing an original song that she wrote on a piano. Stix tries to encourage Sparkle to sing. A few nights later Stix comes to Sparkle's home to take her on a date at a nightclub. On the way home while sitting in front of Sparkle's home Stix tries again to encourage Sparkle to pursue a music career and tries to convince her to form a group with her sisters. Sparkle tells Stix that her mother was a singer, but almost died pursuing her dream.
