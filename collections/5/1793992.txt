On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the École Militaire in Paris. He trained to become an artillery officer and, when his father's death reduced his income, was forced to complete the two-year course in one year.[36] He was the first Corsican to graduate from the École Militaire.[36] He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.[37]
