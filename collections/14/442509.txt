According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366 grams of coal would produce 1 kWh of electricity during 2006.[71] At full power, Three Gorges reduces coal consumption by 31 million tonnes per year, avoiding 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions,[72] millions of tonnes of dust, one million tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 370,000 tonnes of nitric oxide, 10,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and a significant amount of mercury.[73] Hydropower saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.
