Return to Laughter, which she wrote under the name Elenore Smith Bowen, remains a well-reviewed work,[2] and it is based on Bohannan's fieldwork in Nigeria. Bohannan used a pseudonym for this book, presumably because she felt its popular tone and autobiographical format were inappropriate for her professional reputation.[3] Bohannan's pseudonym was composed in part from her mother's first name, "Elenore",[4] and her own maiden name "Smith". However, many reviews of Return to Laughter, noted it as her work,[5] and later editions were published without the pseudonym.
