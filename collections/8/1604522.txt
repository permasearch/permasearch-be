Planning to expand the Underworld factory, Tony attempts to convince shopkeeper Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) and mechanic Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to sell their properties to him. When Kevin refuses, Tony enlists his friend Jimmy Dockerson (Robert Beck) to sabotage his business and persuades Kevin's daughter, Rosie Webster, to give him the garage accounts. He also bullies elderly resident Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope) out of his home, wanting to redevelop the site.
