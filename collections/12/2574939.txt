By 1900 "Wabash" had sold millions of copies, becoming the best selling song of its time in terms of sheet music sold.[25] The ballad remained popular during the 1920s, becoming a staple song in many singing acts, including male quartet performances.[19] In addition, J. Stuart Blackton directed a 1923 silent film of the same title that was based partially on the song's lyrics.[26] The song was later featured prominently in the 1942 film My Gal Sal, the title of another song by Dresser.[1]
