The unit's aggressive nature is notable in an era where the NFL has placed particular emphasis on player safety. Seahawks defensive coordinator Kris Richard, who was the defensive backs coach during the Super Bowl season, built the Legion of Boom into a unit that hits hard while staying within the rules. The receivers run routes with shields strapped to their chests that run from neck to mid-thigh, and the defensive backs are taught to keep their hits within that area in order to limit penalties for blows to the head. Bleacher Report described the Legion of Boom as a monument both to Richard and head coach Pete Carroll, who was a safety himself in his playing days and a defensive backs coach in his early coaching career.[9] Carroll also studied taller cornerback tandems like Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes when assembling the core of defensive backs.
