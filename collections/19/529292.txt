When Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and goes out for a drink with her friend, Kate Kavanagh. Kate, who is dating Christian's younger brother, Elliot, confides to Ana that their relationship may be fizzling; Elliot is working closely with Gia, the architect, and Kate is suspicious about their relationship. When Ana returns home, she encounters Jack Hyde, who attempts to kidnap her. Ana's security team subdue him as he holds Ana hostage and he is arrested. After an argument with Christian about her having sneaked out to see Kate, Ana berates Christian for being overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and JosÃ©.
