The mitochondria within each cell contain many copies of a small circular DNA genome and in mammals it is 16,000â€“18,000 base pairs in length. A cell contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria and therefore the genes contained within those mitochondria are more abundant than the genes that occur in the nucleus of the cell.[73][74] The abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) is useful for the genetic analysis of ancient remains where the DNA has degraded.[74][75]
