Christianity arrived on the Indian sea coast with Christian travelers and merchants. The colonial Portuguese conquerors attempted to establish a presence by conquering islands and ports, force converting those they met into Roman Catholicism. The conversion ritual involved making the converts eat beef and pork as a confirmation that they have given up Hinduism or Islam.[91] However, vegetarianism continued amongst some of the Indian Christians, and an estimated 8% of the contemporary Christians in India don't eat meat including that sourced from cattle. According to Sen, Indian ideas about compassion for animals and humane treatment returned from India to Europe with the Portuguese, and drew praise from Voltaire and Isaac Newton,[91] and influenced Descartes, Rousseau and Shelley to question the ethics of meat production and consumption.[92]
