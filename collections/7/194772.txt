The Tapu Sena is a five-member group of children residing in Gokuldham Society (expect Pinku, who lives in a different society): Tapu (the leader of Tapu Sena), Goli, Gogi, Pinku and Sonu. These children have played significant roles, providing a fun young tone to the show. Usually, the group becomes a nuisance for the other members of the society because of their mischief, while at other times, it draws praises from the members by doing something laudable. The society secretary, Atmaram Tukaram Bhide is especially annoyed with the Tapu Sena for playing cricket in the society compound as sometimes they break the window glasses, or just cause a problem as shown in some episodes. Since the beginning of the show, the Tapu Sena has, with their childlike activities, characterized the typical frolicsome Indian children. As the children grow up and mature, the stories are tailored to suit their ages.[3][4]
