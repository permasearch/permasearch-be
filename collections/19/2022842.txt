The article too reliant on quotes. It reads like a WP:QUOTEFARM. Some parts as highlighted do not sound neutral either, a bit fan written. On hold for 7 days. Please ping me or leave me a talkback message on my user talk incase I don't see it in my watch list when you are done.  — Calvin999 09:15, 12 April 2016 (UTC)
