The role of an England national football team manager was first established in 1946 with the appointment of Walter Winterbottom.[1][2] Before this, the England team was selected by the "International Selection Committee",[2] a process in which the Football Association (FA) would select coaches and trainers from the league to prepare the side for single games, but where all decisions ultimately remained under the control of the committee.[3] A 1â€“0 defeat by Switzerland prompted FA secretary Stanley Rous to raise Winterbottom from "National Director of coaching" to "Manager".[1][4]
