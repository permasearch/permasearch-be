Ali (Arabic: علي ابن أبي طالب‎, translit. `Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) was a cousin of Muhammad. He was the second companion of Muhammad after Khadijah to accept Islam. He was only 10 years old at the time of his conversion. At the age of 21, he married Fatimah, Muhammed's youngest daughter by Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, and became a son-in-law of Muhammed. He had three sons (Hasan, Husayn, and Muhsin) and two daughters (Umm Kulthum and Zaynab) with Fatimah. He was a scribe of the Quran, who kept a written copy of it, and memorized its verses as soon as they were revealed. During the Khilafat (Arabic: خِـلَافَـة‎, Caliphate) of Uthman, Umar and Abu Bakr, he was part of the Majlis ash-Shura (Arabic: مَـجْـلِـس الـشُّـوْرَى‎) and took care of Medina in their absence.[citation needed]
