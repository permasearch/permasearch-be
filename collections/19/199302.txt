Following Ramses' eviction, the HouseGuests were quizzed in the Inked and Evicted Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests were asked a series of questions based on photos of the evicted HouseGuests. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Paul was the winner. On Day 38, the HouseGuests learned of the Temptation Competition. Alex, Jason, Mark, and Matt decided to compete in the competition. The four then danced in the Bowlerina Temptation Competition. In this competition, HouseGuests competed individually. They must spin around their handle fifteen times. They will then earn fifteen seconds of bowling time. If they run out of time, they must spin again to earn more time. The HouseGuest who knocks down their four pins the fastest will win safety for the week, while the slowest competitor will be on the block as a third nominee. Mark was the winner, and Jason became the third nominee. On Day 38, Paul nominated Cody and Jessica for eviction. Elena accepted the Have-Not temptation and received the Have-Not Extension. On Day 39, Paul, Jessica, Cody, and Jason, accompanied by Kevin and Raven, weathered the pain in the returned Under the Weather Power of Veto competition. The day before the competition, HouseGuests listened to a series of BB Storm Watch updates. In this competition, HouseGuests competed individually. HouseGuests looked at a teleprompter for sentences with blanks. HouseGuests had to report the weather and fill in the blanks with the name of one of the first four evicted HouseGuests while standing in a storm. If the sentence passes through the teleprompter before the HouseGuest fills in the blank, they will be incorrect. The HouseGuest who fills in the most blanks correctly will win the Power of Veto. Paul was the winner. On Day 41, Paul used the Power of Veto on Jason. On Day 44, Jessica used the Halting Hex and canceled the eviction.
