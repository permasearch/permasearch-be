Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination.  In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site;[82] by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia.[83]  The number reached over a million in 2007,[84] and over two million by 2012.[85] Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013.[86]   The site has been managed by the private SOKIMEX group since 1990, which rented it from the Cambodian government. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some graffiti; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole Angkor site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.[87]
