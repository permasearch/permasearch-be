NB: ARC can only be confirmed in conjunction with additional clinical tests for retinal correspondence. The patient must demonstrate a manifest deviation on cover test. Despite their apparent deviation, when tested with the W4LT they will produce a normal BSV result, indicating the presence of Abnormal Retinal Correspondence.
