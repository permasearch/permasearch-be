Jazz is the smallest of the Autobots. Michael Bay stated in an early interview that Jazz stands 13 feet tall, however the scale of his Deluxe toy suggests he would stand closer to 15 feet tall. This is confirmed by his profile in the second issue of the Transformers U.K. Magazine, where it is stated he stands 15 feet 7Â inches tall, weighs 1.8 tons and has a maximum speed of 400 miles per hour. The official guide to the Transformers video game also says he's 15 feet tall. Despite his small stature, Jazz was fearless, and would not hesitate to attack a much larger foe. Jazz engages Megatron, defying him to the end, but is overwhelmed by the Decepticon, and Jazz was caught in his grip, asking him, "You want a piece of me?"  Megatron responded "No, I want TWO!", ripping Jazz in half. The vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.
