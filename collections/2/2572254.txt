The title of Harrison's only career-spanning compilation album, Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison (2009), was derived from "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)", which also appears on the album.[98] Shortly after Harrison's death on 29 November 2001,[99] My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James recorded the track for his EP of George Harrison cover songs, Tribute To, issued in August 2009.[100]
