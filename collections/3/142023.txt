Regarding religion, Murphy had previously been verging on agnostic, but confirmed his atheism after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film Sunshine.[96] He was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.[97] He began eating meat again for his role in Peaky Blinders.[98] His political activity includes participating in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election,[93] and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organization Focus Ireland.[99] In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for "highlighting [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation".[100][101]
