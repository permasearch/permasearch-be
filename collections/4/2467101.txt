The role garnered Louis-Dreyfus several milestone accolades: her fourteenth Primetime Emmy Award nomination for a role in the regular cast of a comedy series surpassed Lucille Ball as the most ever. Her Primetime Emmy Award for her third different regular cast role also was a record-setting achievement for a comedy actress. Her five consecutive Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins break a record and her six overall Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins also break a record.
