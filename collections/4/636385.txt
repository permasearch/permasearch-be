In one of the teaser trailers it was said that "the battle of time and space is not over yet!", implying a direct connection to the previous film. The final poster for the film does not contain images of either Dialga or Palkia, although Dialga is shown battling Giratina in a trailer released in March 2008, on the official website for the film. The Origin Forme of Giratina is shown on the final poster with the tagline: "PokÃ©mon will follow the new light."
