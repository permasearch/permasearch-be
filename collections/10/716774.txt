During ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide,[7] collecting 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards.[8][9] Despite early singles success in the United Kingdom, the band was initially more successful in the United States, where they were billed as "the English guys with the big fiddles."[10] From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated twenty Top 20 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US Billboard Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits (20) without a number one single of any band in US chart history.[11][12][nb 1] In 2017, the ELO line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, and Tandy were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[15]
