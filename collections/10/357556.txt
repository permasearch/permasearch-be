It was later discovered that the area leased to Boggs & Sanders already belonged to Dicky Bolles, as part of the 500,000 acres he had purchased; however, the Everglades Plantation Company was able to retain the land, despite Bolles' claims.[11] Sanders led further reclamation efforts for the area, including the digging of 60 miles of ditches.[11] Boggs & Sanders were also granted extensions to their 2-year contract, on the grounds that the land remained under water.[11]
