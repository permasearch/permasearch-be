In the Early Geometric period (900â€“850 BC), the height of the vessels had been increased, while the decoration is limited around the neck down to the middle of the body of the vessel. The remaining surface is covered by a thin layer of clay, which during the firing takes a dark, shiny, metallic color.[8] That was the period when the decorative theme of the meander was added to the pottery design, the most characteristic element of Geometric art.
