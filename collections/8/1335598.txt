For occurrences of "contagious" discrete events, like tornado outbreaks, the Polya distributions can be used to give more accurate models than the Poisson distribution by allowing the mean and variance to be different, unlike the Poisson. "Contagious" events have positively correlated occurrences causing a larger variance than if the occurrences were independent, due to a positive covariance term.
