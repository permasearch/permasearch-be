Oggs Cruz of Rappler gave a mix review stating that "it's a beautiful film" but notes that the film is "dull and ineffective", and added that the film "feels too mechanical, too designed to work, but he also complimented the overflowing musical scorer."[15] Philbert Ortiz Dy of ClickTheCity.com rated the film 2 stars out of 5 commenting that "the [film] is just oddly constructed all around. There’s just so much to address, and the movie just doesn’t seem willing to do the work to give all these issues the time they need."[16] Nazamel Tabares, a movie blogger for Movies Philippines also rated the film 2 stars out of 5 and went to say that "there’s nothing new in the film and nothing worth keeping after seeing."[17] Je C.C. of Philippine Entertainment Portal reviewed the film as "still falling into the pitfalls of Star Cinema cliches, Barcelona: A Love Untold becomes a film of blemished beauty, but that is fine."[18] On the other hand, Rod Magaru, an entertainment blogger, rated the film 9 out of 10 and called it a "masterpiece of 2016" and commended Carmi Raymundo for the way she wrote the flashbacks and added that "it is one of her best."[19] Edmund Silvestre, New York correspondent for Philstar Global Entertainment wrote, "Barcelona is an enchanting (and hit) tearjerker."[20]
