The ATF arrests Luann Delaney and Cherry, the women of Otto and Half-Sack, and threatens them with prison if they do not give information on SAMCRO. Bobby, Piney and Tig start a brawl at a local bar and most of the town's small police force have to go to the scene to break it up. This gives Jax and Opie an opportunity to break into the police station, with the help of Unser, and free Cherry. Luann stays behind because the ATF are about to get Otto to plead to a case that he thought was harmless, to secure him and Luann a deal, but in fact would lead to the arrest of every club member. So Luann has to get the message to Otto.[14]
