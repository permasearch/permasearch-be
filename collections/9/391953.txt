President William Howard Taft changed things up at the White House, converting the stables there to a garage and purchasing a four-car fleet[21] on a $12,000 budget (equivalent to $326,844 in 2017):[22] two "luxurious" Pierce-Arrow cars, a Baker Motor Vehicle electric car, and a $4,000 1911 White Motor Company steam car.  President Taft became a fan of the steam car when he discovered he could conceal himself from press photographers with a "carefully timed burst of steam."[21]
