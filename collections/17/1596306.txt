Reema wants to tell Ronit what had happened. But before she could tell, Ronit tells her about the Milind incident. He informs Reema that he ran over a guy yesterday night near Gauri Mandir. While he was telling her, Reema too was recollecting about the guy whom she knocked down yesterday. Ronit then tells Reema that the guy was none other than Poornima's husband-to-be Milind. Reema is shocked when she hears this. Ronit tells her that he has lost Pooja forever now and is very sad. He then asks Reema what did she wanted to say, but Reems seems scared and says nothing. She adds though that everything will be alright. Poornima meanwhile cannot forget Milind - naturally. She keeps on thinking the good time she had spent with him and how his death happened. BTW, the scenes when the credit are shown have changed and even the in-between snap shot during breaks.
