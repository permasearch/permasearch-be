Penalty for Failure to Timely File Return: If a taxpayer is required to file an income or excise tax return and fails to timely do so, a late filing penalty may be assessed. The penalty is 5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%.[6] A minimum penalty of $205 may apply for returns over 60 days late. The minimum penalty is the lesser of $205 or 100% of the tax due on the return.
