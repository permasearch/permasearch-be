Due to their close proximity, Wolves also share rivalries with the two Birmingham clubs, Aston Villa and Birmingham City, both of whom they have faced numerous times dating back to the 19th century.[95][96] Their closest geographic rival is Walsall but, as they rarely compete at the same level,[97] this is of less significance. As Wolverhampton historically sat in Staffordshire, a Staffordshire derby between them and Stoke City was once recognised.
