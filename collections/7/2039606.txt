The night of the match arrives, and Apollo has made a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the full fifteen rounds was a fluke. This match is not nearly as close this time as Rocky, fighting right-handed to protect his eye instead of his natural southpaw, is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. By the fifteenth round, Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. Creed, not wanting the fight to end like it did the first time, ignores his trainer's pleas, and decides to carry on alone. In the final round, Rocky switches back to his natural stance, and in dramatic fashion, both men, exhausted, trade punches until they knock each other down. If neither got up, it would be a draw with Creed retaining the title. Rocky gets back up at the count of nine while Apollo collapses from fatigue, giving Rocky the win by knockout, and making him the new world champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on TV: "Yo, Adrian, I did it!"
