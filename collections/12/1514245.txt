Yale was born into a wealthy family. When her parents pass away, she inherits their wealth. Yale leads a carefree and indulgent life, nonchalant about the running of the family bridal business and the investments she holds, and leaves these to her employees. Reality bites one day and Ya Le realizes that the bridal business is in the red, the investments have largely reaped no returns and the banks are hounding for repayment of the loans. She tries to seek help from her friends, but she is hurt to find out that they were only interested in her friendship because of her wealth and the lifestyle she could afford to share with them. Yale is now down and out, and her "friends" have all deserted her.
