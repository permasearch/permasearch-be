Candlemaker William Procter, born in England, and soapmaker James Gamble, born in Ireland, both emigrated from the United Kingdom. They settled in Cincinnati initially and met when they married sisters Olivia and Elizabeth Norris.[7] Alexander Norris, their father-in-law, called a meeting in which he persuaded his new sons-in-law to become business partners. On October 31, 1837, as a result of the suggestion, Procter & Gamble was created.
