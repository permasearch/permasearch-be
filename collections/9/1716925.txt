When Crowe was four years old, his family moved to Sydney, Australia, where his parents pursued a career in set catering.[4] The producer of the Australian TV series Spyforce was his mother's godfather, and Crowe (at age five or six) was hired for a line of dialogue in one episode, opposite series star Jack Thompson (in 1994 Thompson played the father of Crowe's character in The Sum of Us).[citation needed] Crowe also appeared briefly in the serial The Young Doctors.
