With seventeen NBA Championships, the Celtics have won more than any other NBA franchise, while the 1959-to-1966 domination of the NBA Championship, with eight straight titles, is the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any North American professional sports team to date. Following this, the Celtics had two major periods of success separated by quite poor seasons during rebuilding. Between 1971–72 and 1975–76 the Celtics, led by Dave Cowens and John Havlicek, won 294 of 410 regular season games and played in three more NBA Finals series for two championships, whilst between 1979–80 and 1987–88 led by the frontcourt of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish the Celtics won 550 of 742 regular season games and reached nine consecutive Conference Finals.
