From 2012 to 2015, Cesternino hosted annual "Miss Survivor" competitions, in which podcast listeners could vote for female Survivor players to compete as finalists in a personality and beauty contest. The first competition, in 2012, allowed listeners to vote in any five women from Survivor's first 23 seasons as a finalist. The finalists would then participate in an interview with Cesternino and campaign for votes to win. This inaugural competition was won by Parvati Shallow, of Cook Islands, Micronesia, and Heroes vs. Villains.
