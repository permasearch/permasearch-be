When a significant amount of an anticholinergic is taken into the body, a toxic reaction known as acute anticholinergic syndrome may result. This may happen accidentally or intentionally as a consequence of recreational drug use. Anticholinergic drugs are usually considered the least enjoyable by many recreational drug users,[4] possibly because the side effects are so unpleasant and that they do not induce euphoria. There have, however, been a few reported cases of users experiencing what they described as "euphoria" from the use of an anticholinergic drug.[citation needed] In terms of recreational use, these drugs are commonly referred to as deliriants.[5] The risk of addiction is low in the anticholinergic class, and recreational use is uncommon.
