Both teams then had chances during the rest of the first half, notably Sebastian Deisler for Germany; David Seaman and Oliver Kahn both made some good saves. Just before the end of the half, England got another free kick on the edge of the German penalty area, which was again taken by Beckham. Though he failed to beat the German wall, he was able to cross the ball back into the penalty area. Rio Ferdinand headed it back to Steven Gerrard, who shot the ball into the bottom-left corner of the German goal from 25 yards out, putting England 2â€“1 up.
