The Patriots' third game at home this season was their second loss of the season. Tom Brady's attempted comeback in the fourth quarter was not enough to beat Cam Newton and the Panthers as Carolina upset New England 33â€“30. At the end of Week 4, the Patriots' defense was ranked last in the entire NFL.[154] This was the second consecutive time that the Pats lost a heartbreaker to Cam Newton.
