The release of the faster and less costly by half Apple Macintosh in 1984 spelled the end of the Lisa as a viable commercial product. Two later Lisa models were released (the Lisa 2 and its Mac ROM-enabled sibling Macintosh XL) before the Lisa line was discontinued in April 1985.[29] In 1986, Apple offered all Lisa and XL owners the opportunity to return their computer, with an additional payment of US$1,498, in exchange for a Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk 20.[30]  Reportedly 2,700 working but unsold Lisa computers were buried in a landfill.[31]
