Luther made an attempt to remove the books of Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation from the canon (notably, he perceived them to go against certain Protestant doctrines such as sola gratia and sola fide)[citation needed] but this was not generally accepted among his followers. However, these books are ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible to this day.[5]
