The station's controller, Matthew Bannister, denied that the failure to include "Real Love" was a ban, saying that it merely meant that the song had not been included on the playlist of each week's 60 most regularly featured songs.[citation needed] The station also hit back by devoting a "Golden Hour" to the group's music as well as music by bands influenced by the Beatles. This "Golden Hour" concluded with a playing of "Real Love".[12]
