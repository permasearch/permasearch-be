In 2004 Romania enjoyed one of the largest world market share in machine tools (5.3%)[citation needed]. Romanian-based companies such as Dacia, Petrom, Rompetrol, Bitdefender, Romstal and Mobexpert have expanded operations throughout the region. However, small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms form the bulk of Romania's industrial sector.
