It was marked by several nations of Native Americans: the Cheyenne established a peace treaty[10] and the Lakota calendar was reset.[11][12] Abolitionists like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass as well as slave-owners took note[13][14] and others.[15] The New York Evening Post carried a series of articles on the event including reports from Canada to Jamaica,[16] it made news in several states beyond New York[17][18] and though it appeared in North America was talked about in Europe.[19] The journalism of the event tended to rise above the partisan debates of the time and reviewed facts as they could be sought out.[20] Abraham Lincoln commented on it years later.[21] Near Independence, Missouri, in Clay County, a refugee Mormon community watched the meteor shower on the banks of the Missouri River after having been driven from their homes by local settlers.[22] The founder and first leader of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, afterwards noted in his journal that this event was a literal fulfillment of the word of God and a sure sign that the coming of Christ was close at hand.[23] Though it was noted in the midwest and eastern areas it was also noted in the far west.[24]
