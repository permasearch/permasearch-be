Members of the Jamaica Constabulary Force are trained at one of three colleges; Twickenham Park, Spanish Town, St.Â Catherine, Harman Barracks Training Wing in Kingston, adjacent to Up Park Camp or UWI Mona in Papine, St. Andrew. Recruits undergo a minimum of six months' basic training. Students are required to sit four written examinations called modules and twelve practical tests. They are exposed to on-the-job training through visits to selected police stations and Parish Courts. Upon completion of basic training, they are transferred to various divisions (where they are placed under supervision of the Divisional Training Sub-Officer) to continue their two-year probationary training. At the end of 18 months' service, probationary officers return to the Jamaica Police Academy for an additional five weeks of training. Thereafter, they return to their divisions to complete the probationary period. Some elements of the JCF are trained in a para-military fashion, and the element of the force is the Mobile Reserve.
