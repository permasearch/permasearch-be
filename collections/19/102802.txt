The 28-sided structure, with a stepped facade, was intended to give the tower more window exposure.[13] A concrete hat-truss at the top of the building, similar to one used in the Trump World Tower,[162] ties exterior columns with the concrete core. This hat-truss increases the effective dimensions of the core to that of the building allowing the building to resist the overturning of lateral forces such as those caused by wind, minor earthquakes, and other impacts perpendicular to the building's height.[163]
