Goering's first chief of staff Generalleutnant Walther Wever was a big advocate of the Ural bomber program, but when he died in a flying accident in 1936, support for the strategic bomber program began to dwindle rapidly under Goering's influences. Under pressure from Goering, Albert Kesselring, Wever's replacement, opted for a medium, all-purpose and twin-engine tactial bomber. Erdhard Milch, who strongly supported Goering conceptions, was instrumental in the Luftwaffe's future. Milch believed that the German industry only had the raw materials and capacity to produce 1,000 four-engine heavy bombers, but many times that number of a twin-engine one. In spring of 1937, just in moment when the Luftwaffe's own Technicall Office had passed the Ju-89 and Do-19 heavy bombers models ready for testing, Goering ordered a halt to all work on the four-engine strategic bomber program.[144] However, in 1939 the Bomber B program sought to produce a twin-engined strategic bomber that could carry nearly-equivalent bombloads of Allied four-engined heavy bombers, but as an advanced development of the pre-war Schnellbomber concept. The Bomber B designs meant to achieve top level speeds of at least 600 km/h (370 mph). The Bomber B program went nowhere, as the intended designs required pairs of combat-reliable aviation engines of at least 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) apiece,[citation needed] something that the German aviation engine industry had serious problems in developing. A further design program initiated in the late spring of 1942, intended for the Luftwaffe to have trans-Atlantic ranged four-engined (and later six-engined) bombers to attack the continental United States and aptly named the Amerika Bomber, also went nowhere, with only five prototype airframes getting airborne for testing from two design competitors, before the war's end.
