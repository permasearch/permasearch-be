Ellis played for the school's basketball team, recording 21 assists in one game.[4] He played baseball as an infielder for a local semi-professional team called the "Pittsburgh Pirates Rookies", along with future major leaguers Bobby Tolan, Roy White, Ron Woods, Reggie Smith, Don Wilson, Bob Watson, and Dave Nelson; the team was managed by Chet Brewer.[5] However, Ellis refused to play for the Gardena High School baseball team, because a baseball player referred to him as a "spearchucker".[4]
