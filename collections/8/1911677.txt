Composing a letter on his portable typewriter, the man provides an introduction, giving his name, exact address and phone number, which makes his words seem, in the opinion of the ladies, like those of "an accountant". In the meantime, he walks down the street, thinking "it would be a break if Rebecca has a little bread, that's a big plus, yeah, to have a chick with money, makes everything so easy..." Entering a flower shop, he is asked by the European-accented florist (Leonidas Ossetynski), "how goes with the book writing, Mal?", answering, "great, great, I've got two publishers fighting over me". When the florist says, "then I guess you won't sell the movie rights to that guy from studio", he replies, "oh, not yet". Inquiring of the florist, "what've you got that's cheap?", he buys two bunches of spring flowers and leaves.[6]
