When sailing craft are on a course where the angle of attack between the sail and the apparent wind (α ) exceeds the point of maximum lift on the CL–CD polar diagram, separation of flow occurs.[34] The separation becomes more pronounced until at α = 90° lift becomes small and drag predominates. In addition to the sails used upwind, spinnakers provide area and curvature appropriate for sailing with separated flow on downwind points of sail.[35]
