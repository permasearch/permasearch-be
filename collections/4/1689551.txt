The city plan of New Delhi (the area surrounding Rajpath) was made by the British architect Edwin Lutyens. Rajpath (then called King's Way or Kingsway by the British) was of central importance to the plan. Lutyens wanted a panoramic view of the city of Delhi from the Viceroyâ€™s palace. The view from Raisina Hill runs unhindered across Rajpath and India Gate and is obstructed only by the National Stadium.
