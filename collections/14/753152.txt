Any merge should probably end up at pitching record. Because wins and losses are two sides of the same coin, we don't want redirects from one to the other which would cause confusion. If win (baseball) redirects to pitching record, that makes sense, but why should one of win/loss redirect to the other? It doesn't make sense, and we don't want people questioning why they got redirected where they did. They're all possible search terms, and I don't think win (baseball) or loss (baseball) is more "searchable" than pitching record. Nobody is going to type in "win (baseball)" in the search box, and why should someone who clicks loss at the loss disambiguation page get sent to win?
