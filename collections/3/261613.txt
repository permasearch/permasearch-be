Following the release of the album and some Warped Tour 2011 appearances, the band announced its first headlining tour across the United States, with locations beginning in New Mexico, looping around the east coast, and concluding in Colorado. The tour took place from September to October 2011 with support acts Eyes Set to Kill and For All Those Sleeping.[40][41] The band's first supporting tour was to be a ten-show tour in November 2011 with headliners Black Veil Brides and supporting acts Aiden and Drive-A,[42] but was canceled after Black Veil Brides dropped out when their lead vocalist Andy Biersack broke his nose.[43] Emmure replaced Falling in Reverse on the second half of the Take A Picture, It Lasts Longer Tour with We Came As Romans[44] and the band played an exclusive show at KROQ on November 8 to make up for the canceled shows.[45]
