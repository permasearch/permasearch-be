The Tigers' resistance to racial integration lasted for more than 11 seasons after Jackie Robinson's breakthrough in 1947. Then, on June 6, 1958, Ozzie Virgil, Sr., an Afro-Latin American infielder from the Dominican Republic, started at third base in an 11â€“2 defeat of the Washington Senators. Detroit was the 15th of the then-16 MLB teams in existence to break the color line. The Tigers did not field their first African-American player until April 10, 1959, when future Hall of Famer Larry Doby, who had integrated the American League in 1947 for the Cleveland Indians and had been acquired in a spring training trade, started in left field on Opening Day at Briggs Stadium. His career winding down, the 35-year-old Doby appeared in only 18 games for Detroit before his contract was sold to the White Sox on May 13. Only the Boston Red Sox then trailed the Tigers in integrating their roster; they finally relented on July 21, 1959.
