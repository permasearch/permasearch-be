At work, Ammer tells Michael he plans on retiring, which would make Michael the CEO. Michael momentarily forgets about the remote, and tells Ammer he wishes he were CEO. The remote fast-forwards ten years into the future where Michael is now CEO. While Michael is wealthy and well-off, he has become morbidly obese, Donna has divorced him, and both Ben and Samantha have become moody teenagers. He argues with Donna and new husband Bill, which brings their family dog to jump atop Michael, knocking him into a coma. The remote time-skips several years to when Michael wakes from the coma, and is no longer obese. Ben is now a partner of the firm, and Michael's father Ted has died.
