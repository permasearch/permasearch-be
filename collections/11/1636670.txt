Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B, stating "I've been down on Family Guy recently for experimenting a little bit too much with morality and form, but tonight's episode was the kind that I think it still does well. It's not as good as it was pre-cancellation, but there's a pleasant weirdness to it that makes me think that this is the way Family Guy should be. It's not excellent, but it's more than good enough".[8]
