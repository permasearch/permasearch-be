In 1975, cellist John Painter founded the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO). The ACO is a conductorless chamber orchestra led by concertmaster Richard Tognetti, appointed artistic director and lead violin in 1990. The ACO functions as an ‘ensemble of soloists’ and gravitates toward cross-genre programming. They perform on both modern and period instruments, in smaller chamber groups, as a chamber orchestra, and as an electro-acoustic collective. Referencing past traditions, all musicians except cellists stand while performing.
