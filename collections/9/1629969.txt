In November 2014, the Duggars asked married couples to take a picture while kissing and share it on their Facebook page. Several users noted that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted from the Duggar's Facebook page.[58] While working for the Family Research Council, the Duggar's eldest son, Josh Duggar, said "I truly believe every child deserves a mother and a father"; the Family Research Council has been labeled as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, with SPLC saying they were designated as such due to their publication of "anti-gay propaganda."[59][60][61] Josh Duggar has been described as an "anti-gay activist" by GLAAD.[62]
