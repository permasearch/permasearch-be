"PPI was mis-sold and complaints about it mishandled on an industrial scale for well over a decade."[5] with this mis-selling being carried out by not only the banks or providers, but also by third party brokers.  The sale of such policies was typically encouraged by large commissions,[6] as the insurance would commonly make the bank/provider more money than the interest on the original loan, such that many mainstream personal loan providers made little or no profit on the loans themselves; all or almost all profit was derived from PPI commission and profit share. Certain companies developed sales scripts which guided salespeople to say only that the loan was “protected” without mentioning the nature or cost of the insurance. When challenged by the customer, they sometimes incorrectly stated that this insurance improved the borrower's chances of getting the loan or that it was mandatory.[7] A consumer in financial difficulty is unlikely to further question the policy and risk the loan being refused.
