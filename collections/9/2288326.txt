The JardÃ­n Reforma or Reforma Square was originally a market, built in 1861. When the Hidalgo Market opened, most vendors moved out. In 1923, the site was renovated into a garden with a central fountain and Indian laurel, eucalyptus and cypress trees.[50] The Jardin Reforma has an arched entryway with a series of thin columns.[34]
