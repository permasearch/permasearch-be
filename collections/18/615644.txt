Many of the characters are semi-autobiographical, sharing similarities with figures from his memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home (1973/paperback 1999). In The Things They Carried, O'Brien plays with the genre of metafiction; he writes using verisimilitude. His use of real place names and inclusion of himself as the protagonist blurs fiction and non-fiction.[3] As part of this effect, O'Brien dedicates The Things They Carried to the fictional men of the "Alpha Company", contributing to the novel appearing to be a war memoir.[4]
