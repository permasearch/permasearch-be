Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was entertaining but she also feels like it was a bit of a letdown. "As much as I love this show, it deserves a big come on this week. After a week of titillating previews of Stefan and Katherine mauling each other, it all turns out to be just a dream. What a letdown."[7]
