Historical records and oral history document a phreatic eruption on July 2, 1840 and pyroclastic flow from radial fissures on the upper north flank of Mount Ararat and a possibly associated earthquake of magnitude 7.4 that caused severe damage and numerous casualties. Up to 10,000 people in the Mount Ararat region died in the earthquake, including 1,900 villagers in the village of Akhuri (Armenian: Akori, modern YenidoÄŸan) who were killed by a gigantic landslide and subsequent debris flow. In addition, this combination of landslide and debris flow destroyed the Armenian monastery of St. Jacob near Akori, the town of Aralik, several villages, and Russian military barracks. It also temporarily dammed the Sevjur (Metsamor) River.[50][47][48][51]
