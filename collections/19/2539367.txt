Oman has no system of checks and balances, and thus no separation of powers.[14] All power is concentrated in the sultan,[14] who is also chief of staff of the armed forces, Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs and chairman of the Central Bank.[14] All legislation since 1970 has been promulgated through royal decrees, including the 1996 Basic Law.[14] The sultan appoints judges, and can grant pardons and commute sentences.[14] The sultan's authority is inviolable and the sultan expects total subordination to his will.[14]
