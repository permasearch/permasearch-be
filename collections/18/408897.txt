Many years later, she is freed by Jafar who requires her help. After finding Elizabeth's dead body, she takes her eyes in order for Jafar to locate the third genie's lamp. Learning that the Red Queen has it, the Jabberwocky hunts down the Red Queen and steals the bottle from her. She brings the Red Queen to Jafar as a prisoner and later taunts the Red Queen on her past history, as requested by Jafar. Eventually, the Jabberwocky successfully makes the Red Queen use all of her wishes. Later, after Jafar changed the laws of magic, he uses the Vorpal Blade to pin the Jabberwocky to the dungeon walls upon her serving her purpose. The Jabberwocky is later freed.[59]
