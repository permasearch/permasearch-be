The biodiversity of Laos is incredibly unique, hosting a plethora of flora species that are used by the people of Laos in their every day life and wellbeing. Preserving this biodiversity through research and development projects has begun through the Pha Tad Ke Botanical Garden . Pha Tad Ke is spearheading efforts to promote a new type of ecotourism focusing on raising fundamental awareness in the population to the importance of biodiversity, supporting the educational development of young students, and helping local villages. It is located on the Mekong River, 15 minutes by boat from the center of town. The site offers an unparalleled tourist experience, offering a deeper insight to the intersection of nature and culture in the country.
