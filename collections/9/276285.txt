The electric code makes a distinction between "high" voltages (100 Volts and higher), and "low" voltages below that, and which have two different safety classifications and regulations. For circuits defined as low voltage, in some jurisdictions, there is no requirement for licensing, training, or certification of installers, and no inspection of completed work is required, for either residential or commercial work. Low voltage cabling run in the walls and ceilings of commercial buildings is also typically excluded from the requirements to be installed in protective conduit.
