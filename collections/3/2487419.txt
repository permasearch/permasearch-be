Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York from "Louie's Shack", the small diner at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field (now St. Louis Lambert International Airport) in suburban Anglum, MO. Quoted a price of $15,000 ($210,000 today) for a Bellanca high-wing monoplane, "Slim" lobbies St. Louis financiers with a plan to fly the Atlantic in 40 hours in a stripped-down, single-engine aircraft. The backers are excited by Lindbergh's vision and dub the venture Spirit of St. Louis.
