For most of Fremantle's history, players have played for various West Australian Football League (WAFL) teams when not selected to play for the Fremantle AFL team.  Players recruited from the WAFL have remained with their original club, and players recruited from interstate have been allocated to teams via a draft system.  Since the 2014 season, the Peel Thunder Football Club has served as the host club for the Fremantle Dockers, an arrangement which will see Fremantle's reserves players playing in the WAFL for Peel Thunder Football Club.  An attempt to field a standalone Fremantle reserves side in the WAFL was rejected by the other WAFL clubs.[44]  A similar host club system was used in 1999 when South Fremantle was the aligned club but was cancelled after a single season.
