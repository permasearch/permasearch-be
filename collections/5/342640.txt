The subjects of Corgan's lyrics on Siamese Dream varied. Corgan noted that most of his lyrics for the album were about his girlfriend and future ex-wife Chris Fabian, with whom he had briefly broken up at the time he wrote the songs.[20] Corgan occasionally wrote about other subjects. In "Cherub Rock", the album's opening track, Corgan attacked the American music industry,[23] and "Today" is about a day that he was experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts.[11]  "Spaceboy" was written as a tribute to his autistic half-brother, Jesse.[24]
