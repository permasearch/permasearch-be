The Evil Queen (voiced by Susan Blakeslee) appears in the third Shrek film where she assists Prince Charming in taking over Far Far Away when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple bar. Prince Charming refers to her as the "Wicked Witch." When she is about to kill Queen Lillian (with a sword to her neck), Artie asserts they all can all stop being evil if they are willing to make a better choice. The Evil Queen happily says that she always wants to open a spa in France.
