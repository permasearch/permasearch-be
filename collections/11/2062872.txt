The Vikings arrived in Paris on Easter Sunday, 29 March,[8] entered the city and plundered it.[5][8] During the siege, a plague broke out in their camp. The Norse had been exposed to the Christian religion, and after first praying to the Norse gods, they undertook a fast, acting on the advice of one of their Christian prisoners, and the plague subsided.[10] The Franks could not assemble any effective defence against the invaders,[5] and the Vikings withdrew only after being paid a ransom of 7,000 livres (French pounds) of silver and gold by Charles the Bald,[9] amounting to approximately 2,570 kilograms (5,670Â lb).[11] Considering Ragnar's earlier loss of land to Charles, the substantial payment may also have been regarded as some form of compensation to Ragnar, and the invasion itself as an act of revenge.[9] This was the first of a total of thirteen payments of so-called Danegeld to Viking raiders by the Franks[1] (the term is not expressly known to have been used at this point).[12] While agreeing to withdraw from Paris, Ragnar pillaged several sites along the coast on the return voyage, including the Abbey of Saint Bertin.[8]
