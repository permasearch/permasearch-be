Nomadic people are communities who move from one place to another, rather than settling permanently in one location. Many cultures have traditionally been nomadic, but nomadic behavior is increasingly rare in industrialized countries. Nomadic cultures are listed in three categories of economic specialization: hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, and "peripatetic nomads".
