Because the Mississippi River played an essential role in establishing St. Louis's identity as the gateway to the west, a memorial commemorating it should be near the river. Railroad tracks that had been constructed in the 1930s on the levee obstructed views of the riverfront from the memorial site.[15] When Ickes declared that the railway must be removed before he would allocate funds for the memorial,[21] President of the St. Louis Board of Public Service Baxter Brown suggested that "a new tunnel ... conceal the relocated tracks and re-grading of the site to elevate it over the tunnel. These modifications would eliminate the elevated and surface tracks and open up the views to the river."[15] Although rejected by NPS architect Charles Peterson, Brown's proposal formed the basis for the ultimate settlement.[21]
