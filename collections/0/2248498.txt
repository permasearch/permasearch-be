The source of heat for volcanism in the Lassen area is subduction off the Northern California coast of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate.[5] The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots, stinking fumaroles, and churning hot springs.[6] Lassen Volcanic National Park is one of the few areas in the world where all four types of volcano can be found (plug dome, shield, cinder cone, and strato).[7]
