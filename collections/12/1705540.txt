As other virulent bacteria, GBS harbors an important number of virulence factors (virulence factors are molecules produced by bacteria that boosts their capacity to infect and damage human tissues), the most important being the capsular polysaccharide (rich in sialic acid) [4][13] and a pore-forming toxin, Î²-hemolysin.[13] Today it is considered that GBS pigment and hemolysin are identical or closely related molecules.[14][15][16][17]
