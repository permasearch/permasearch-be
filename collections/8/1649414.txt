"The aim of this inquiry is to talk to people at UEFA about Financial Fair Play, bearing in mind that, for the 2012–13 season, the cumulative deficit of professional clubs in France was €250 million. The commission will focus in particular on the financing of clubs like Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco by Qatari or Russian investors, and the fairness of that in relation to their opponents in domestic competition."
