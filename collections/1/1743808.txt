The sources for the present Wiki article's often stated version of the first law are eleven. This list of sources is long because the matter is important. Two of them are references to the original statement of the first law, as distinct from previous historical statements that are more or less like the first law but do not exactly state it. There follow seven authoritative sources on general thermodynamics showing continuity over a century of agreement about the statement. The statement by Prigogine and Defay (1954), a textbook of Chemical thermodynamics, takes the viewpoint espoused by the current version of the lead sentence of the Wiki article; this viewpoint is represented in the current version of the Wiki article by a specific reference in its fifth sentence. Accordingly, I will shortly remove that Prigogine and Defay (1945) reference from the list of references for the often stated version of the law. Shortly I will also delete from that list the reference to the 1897/1903 textbook by Helmholtz because it is in German and not readily available to English speakers.Chjoaygame (talk) 22:59, 9 September 2011 (UTC)
