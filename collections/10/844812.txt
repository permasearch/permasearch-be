Members of various executive agencies and other officials—such as the attorney general, the secretary and registrar of the province, the treasurer, the commissioner of crown lands, and the commissioner of agriculture and public works—are appointed by the Crown under the Great Seal of the province.[68] Further, only in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick may the lieutenant governor appoint judges of the courts of probate, and only in Quebec is the solicitor general commissioned by the viceroy. Public inquiries are also commissioned by the Queen or governor-in-council through a Royal Warrant, and are called royal commissions.
