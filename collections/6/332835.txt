Typhoon Haiyan was an extremely powerful and deadly typhoon, known as Super Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines. On making landfall, Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.[1] It is the deadliest Philippine typhoon on record,[2] killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.[3] In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds, Haiyan is tied with Meranti for being the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. In January 2014, bodies were still being found.[4]
