Nick brings a wounded Trubel to the hospital; he finds three false IDs and a fingerprint-locked phone in her jacket. Trubel tells the nurse her name is "Lauren Cole", matching one of the IDs and the registration of an expensive, weaponized motorcycle. The next day, Nick and Hank investigate the murder of two Klaustreich. Selina, the girlfriend of one of the victims, mentions a dump where they went to sport-hunt Reinigen (rat-like Wesen), and informs them of a third missing Klaustreich, Johnny. Monroe and Rosalee explain the legend of the Riesen-ratte, "the rat king", a creature formed when several Reinigen combine. Johnny and Selina are captured by the Reinigen at the dump. Nick, Hank, Monroe, and Rosalee confront the Reinigen who transform into the Riesen-ratte. They manage to save Selina and use power cables to shock the giant rat-king, which separates into several dozen Reinigen laying on the ground in pain. Afterwards, Meisner, with Adalind's help, convinces Nick to trust him; they rush to the hospital and save Trubel from a group of Wesen chanting "Occultatum Libera". Meanwhile, Andrew Dixon continues to push Captain Renard to endorse his run for mayor, promising promotion to Chief of Police.
