The 1988 Constitutional Commission report explained: "the Governor-General is in no sense a delegate of the Queen. The independence of the office is highlighted by changes which have been made in recent years to the Royal Instruments relating to it."[19]  The changes occurred in 1984 when Queen Victoria's letters patent and instructions were revoked and replaced with new letters patent,[20] on Prime Minister Bob Hawke's advice, who stated that this would clarify the Governor-General's position under the constitution.[21][22]
