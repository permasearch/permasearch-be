Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked genetic disorder that results in the absence of the structural protein dystrophin at the neuromuscular junction.  It affects 1 in 3,600â€“6,000 males and frequently causes death by the age of 30.  The absence of dystrophin causes muscle degeneration, and patients present with the following symptoms: abnormal gait, hypertrophy in the calf muscles, and elevated creatine kinase.  If left untreated, patients may suffer from respiratory distress, which can lead to death.[26]
