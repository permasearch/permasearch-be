A gymnast's score comes from deductions taken from their start value. The start value of a routine is based on the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether or not the gymnast meets composition requirements. The composition requirements are different for each apparatus; this score is called the D score.[11] Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from a maximum of 10.0. This score is called the E score.[12] The final score is calculated by taking deductions from the E score, and adding the result to the D score.[13] Since 2007, the scoring system has changed by adding bonus plus the execution and then adding those two together to get the final score.
