Most statutes are meant to be applied in the main not by legal practitioners and judges but by administrative decision makers.[24] Certain laws receive more judicial interpretation than others, either because more is at stake or because those who are affected are in a position to take the matter to court. Whilst the meanings presented to the court are often those that benefit the litigants themselves,[25] the courts are not bound to select one of the interpretations offered by the parties.[26]
