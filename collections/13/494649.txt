British Government cabinet papers from September 1956, during Eden's term as Prime Minister, have shown that French Prime Minister Guy Mollet approached the British Government suggesting the idea of an economic and political union between France and Great Britain.[141] This was a similar offer, in reverse, to that made by Churchill (drawing on a plan devised by Leo Amery[142]) in June 1940.[143]
