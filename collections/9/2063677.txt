In his lyrics to "Awaiting on You All", Harrison conveys the importance of experiencing spirituality directly, while rejecting organised religion as well as political and intellectual substitutes.[28] Author Ian Inglis writes that the lyrics recognise the merit in all faiths, as Harrison sings that the key to any religion is to "open up your heart".[39] The choruses proclaim that individual freedom from the physical or material world can be attained through "chanting the names of the Lord",[40] implying that there is a single deity who happens to be called by different names depending on the faith.[39][41]
