After leaving school Fawkes entered the service of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu, who succeeded his grandfather at the age ofÂ 18.[11] At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.[12][d]
