The last boat to be launched was collapsible D, which left at 02:05 with 25Â people aboard;[132] two more men jumped on the boat as it was being lowered.[133] The sea had reached the boat deck and the forecastle was deep underwater. First-class passenger Edith Evans gave up her place in the boat, and ultimately died in the disaster. She was one of only four women in first class to perish in the sinking. Captain Smith carried out a final tour of the deck, telling the radio operators and other crew members: "Now it's every man for himself."[134]
