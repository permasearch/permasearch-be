Since medication to prevent rejection is so effective, donors do not need to be similar to their recipient. Most donated kidneys come from deceased donors; however, the utilisation of living donors in the United States is on the rise. In 2006, 47% of donated kidneys were from living donors.[9] This varies by country: for example, only 3% of kidneys transplanted during 2006 in Spain came from living donors.[10] In Spain all citizens are potential organ donors in the case of their death, unless they explicitly opt out during their lifetime.[11]
