The first AiO video was released in 1991. This series was created following the success of Focus on the Family's involvement in Tyndale House's video project, McGee and Me. Originally, the Odyssey video series was created by a separate staff from that of the radio series and each episode had a budget of about $400,000; by 1998, over two million Odyssey videos had been sold.[21] Currently, 17 episodes are in the video series and several attempts have been made to place this series on television.[14] The episodes were screened in Britain on Channel 4 in the mid-1990s.
