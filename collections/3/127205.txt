Property tax is based on fair market value of the subject property. The amount of tax is determined annually based on the market value of each property on a particular date,[82] and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically. The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the tax rate.[83] Assessment ratios and tax rates vary widely among jurisdictions, and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction.[84] Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers, such sale establishes fair market value. In other (i.e., most) cases, the value must be estimated. Common estimation techniques include comparable sales, depreciated cost, and an income approach. Property owners may also declare a value, which is subject to change by the tax assessor.
