Team challenge: The chefs assembled in the dining room and were given a display of Greek dancing, setting the theme for the next challenge. The chefs each chose a protein to cook a Greek dish with, and broke plates to determine their other ingredients. Chef Ramsay and guest judge Michael Psilakis would both award each chef between 1 and 5 points, with whichever team gets the most points winning. Alison and Josh faced off first with lamb dishes, and Alison earned 6 points for an otherwise decent dish that was a little overcooked; conversely, Josh's dish was so severely undercooked that Chefs Ramsay and Psilakis refused to taste it, earning him the lowest possible score of 2 points by default. Bret's prawn dish then took the lead, scoring 8 points, while Michelle's unusual choice of prawns and kiwi fruit sauce earned her just 3 points. The lead swung back to the women on the next round, as Meghan earned 9 points for her squid dish, beating Milly (who only got 6 points) for the third time in a challenge. Randy's chicken dish reclaimed the lead again, earning a perfect 10 points(despite having no Greek cuisine experience), and outshining T, who still got a respectable 7 points. Adam retained the lead with his pork dish, getting another 10 points, though the 8 points earned by Christine kept the women in contention. In the final round, Sarah's swordfish dish got 7 points, with Chefs Ramsay and Psilakis noting that it would likely have been a 10 with only a little more seasoning; this left Nick needing 5 points to win, and despite overcooking his swordfish quite badly, he still managed to earn the required number of points to win.
