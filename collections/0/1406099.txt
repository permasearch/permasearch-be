In the immune system dopamine acts upon receptors present on immune cells, especially lymphocytes.[58] Dopamine can also affect immune cells in the spleen, bone marrow, and circulatory system.[59] In addition, dopamine can be synthesized and released by immune cells themselves.[58] The main effect of dopamine on lymphocytes is to reduce their activation level. The functional significance of this system is unclear, but it affords a possible route for interactions between the nervous system and immune system, and may be relevant to some autoimmune disorders.[59]
