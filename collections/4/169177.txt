Originally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift.[119] Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.[120] The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.[121] The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing.[121][122] In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II.[123] Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage on the left side of the escalator.[124] The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common.[121] In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators.[125] After the fatal 1987 King's Cross fire, all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires.[126] The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at Greenford station, which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first incline lift on the UK transport network.[127]
