Renowned fantasy author George R.R. Martin expressed his extreme dissatisfaction, commenting: "Battlestar Galactica ends with 'God Did It.' Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story. Yeah, yeah, sometimes the journey is its own reward. I certainly enjoyed much of the journey with BSG. But damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more? Writing 101, kids. Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream? I've seen Clarion students left stunned and bleeding for turning in stories with those endings."[21] Josh Tyler of Blend Magazine concluded that the final resolution lacked credibility, but that the simple drama of the episode was one reason to view it positively.[22]
