On June 27, 1994, Time published a cover story, "An American Tragedy," with a photo of O. J. Simpson on the cover.[91] The image was darker than a typical magazine image, and the Time photo was darker than the original, as shown on a Newsweek cover released at the same time. Time became the subject of a media scandal. Commentators found that its staff had used photo manipulation to darken the photo, and speculated it was to make Simpson appear more menacing. The publication of the cover photo drew widespread criticism of racist editorializing and yellow journalism. Time publicly apologized.[92]
