A legal complaint was made by the lobbyist, Mark Greene,[78][79] through attorney Robert D. Tuke,[80] to challenge the events of the Tennessee Commission on Indian Affairs meeting on June 19, 2010. He filed a complaint[81] as a "citizen and resident of the State of Tennessee and a registered lobbyist for the Cherokee Nation[82] (actually "Of Oklahoma"),[83](Five Civilized Tribes Act)[82] A Federally Recognized Indian tribe." The Tennessee Attorney General allowed the case to proceed without a full and clear understanding of Supreme Court rulings and Federal laws already in place. The disposition[84] by the Tennessee Attorney General was that the actions of the Tennessee Commission on Indian Affairs "could be found by a court to constitute violations of Tennessee's Open Meetings Act." This was reported by the Knoxville Sentinel.[85][85]
