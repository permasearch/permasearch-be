In 2015 Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets, and they are not allowing people to illegally read the book.[118] In a report, courts stated that they did not infringe on copyright laws, as they were protected under the fair use clause.[119]
