Howard Thompson of the New York Times said, "Whatever possessed these three actors (Mitchum, Kennedy and Balsam) to amble through such a dinky prairie oyster stumps us. And so does the uncertain tone of the picture, methodically directed by Burt Kennedy, which only toward the end asserts itself, clearly and lamely, as a good-natured spoof."[3] Thompson, however, did praise Harry Stradling Jr.'s cinematography.
