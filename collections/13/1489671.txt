The Ahmadis, a small minority representing 0.22â€“2% of Pakistan's population,[539] are officially considered non-Muslims by virtue of the constitutional amendment.[540] The Ahmadis are particularly persecuted, especially since 1974 when they were banned from calling themselves Muslims. In 1984, Ahmadiyya places of worship were banned from being called "mosques".[541] As of  2012[update], 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims.[542] There are also several Quraniyoon communities.[543][544]
