In 1907, Pall Mall was acquired by American Tobacco with the sale of Butler & Butler. The new owners used the premium brand to test innovations in cigarette design, such as, in 1939, the "king-size" (now the standard size for cigarettes at 85mm, although today that includes the filter length), and a new way of stuffing tobacco that supposedly made cigarettes easier on the throat.
