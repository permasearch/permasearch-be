Ellis threw the no-hitter despite being unable to feel the ball or see the batter or catcher clearly.[26] Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore reflective tape on his fingers which helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck out six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.[27]
