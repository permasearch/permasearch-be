Kruger's big game poachers operate with night vision instruments and large caliber rifles, fitted with suppressors and sophisticated telescopic sights.[39][40] They are mostly Mozambique citizens that initiate their carefully planned incursions from the Mozambique border region.[39][41][42] In 2012 some 200 poachers were apprehended,[43] while about 30 were killed in skirmishes.[44][45]
