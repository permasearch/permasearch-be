After a video aired on NBC showing a bull breaking its leg in a 1991 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania rodeo, the city banned controversial rodeo tack, specifically electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels.[39][40] Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may goâ€“specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.[41]
