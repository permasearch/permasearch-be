Kemal Pamuk (played by Theo James) (d. 1913) was an attach√© at the Turkish Embassy in London and the son of one of the Ottoman Sultan's ministers. While participating in the "Albanian talks" he visits Downton as a guest, accompanying Evelyn Napier. His good looks are widely commented on and attract both Mary and Thomas. In the course of a sexual encounter with Mary, Pamuk dies in her bed of a heart attack. The story was inspired by true events. In 1996, Julian Fellowes learned that, according to a friend's great aunt's diary, around 1890 a diplomat did die in the bed of a single woman; the woman and a matron carried the diplomat's corpse to his guest bed, where a valet later found him; the secret was kept for a century.[16]
