While fishing with Wally, Beaver retrieves a drifting canoe and returns it to its owner. At school, the story makes the rounds and is embellished into a tale of rescuing a rich man's daughter in a runaway speedboat. It comes to the attention of Miss Landers, as well as a newspaper offer of $25 for each interesting item sent in, money the class might use. Without Beaver's knowledge, thinking Beaver might be hurt if it is found uninteresting, the class sends the story to the newspaper. Beaver is taken aback to find the misinformation in print and corrects the tale in class. Miss Landers suggests he is a real hero for bravely telling the truth.
