Reclassifying an HUC as a component city likely involves not only amending the concerned city's charter, but also the Local Government Code,[44] as currently there is no provision in the LGC that allows this, nor are there any precedents. Some Cebu City politicians have previously indicated that they wish to bring back the city under the province's control, in order to bring in more votes against the Sugbuak, the proposed partition of Cebu Province.[44]
