The United States Postal Service's first foray into self-adhesive stamps was in 1974 with the 10-cent dove weathervane,[1] produced by Avery Dennison,[3] that soon became discolored due to the instability of the adhesive. It was another 15 years (1989) before another such stamp was issued by the USPS.[2] Stamp collectors criticized the format, as the rubber base adhesive used tended to progressively yellow the stamps. They also found them difficult to remove from covers,[2] and to save in mint condition, though self-adhesives of recent years have improved in these respects. The British Post Office first issued self-adhesive stamps on October 19, 1993, with the introduction of books of 20 First Class stamps, later a 2nd class stamp was introduced. In later years other issues were produced in the self-adhesive format. Die cutting tools for the UK self adhesive stamps were manufactured by Arden Dies of Stockport, Cheshire using tools designed by Robert Clapham.[citation needed] Outside of the philatelic community, the stamps have been welcomed as more convenient; by 2002, virtually all new USPS stamps were issued as self-adhesives.[2]
