Meerab takes his children along with him and says Mehreen to come with him but she says that she will only come back if he leaves the job at Maya's company. But he does not agree . Few days later,when Meerab believes untrue statements by Maya, he plans to marry her. In the meantime, Mehreen plans to take custody of her children. She also has to help Arslan in court so that he can take his property back from Maya. He says Mehreen to give a false statement in court that Meerab and Maya had a pre-planning of grasping his property before Arslan and Maya's marriage. Mehreen could not give this false statement in the court against Meerab as she could not lie after holding the Qur'an and also she cares for her husband's respect.
