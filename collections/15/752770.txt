Alternatively, if       R  1   ,    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{1},}         R  2   ,    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{2},}   and       R  3      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{3}}   are known, but       R  2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{2}}   is not adjustable, the voltage difference across or current flow through the meter can be used to calculate the value of       R  x   ,    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{x},}   using Kirchhoff's circuit laws. This setup is frequently used in strain gauge and resistance thermometer measurements, as it is usually faster to read a voltage level off a meter than to adjust a resistance to zero the voltage.
