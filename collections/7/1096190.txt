In 2011, the South African Reserve Bank issued 100-Rand banknotes which were defective because they lacked fluorescent printing visible under UV light. In June, printing of this denomination was moved from the South African Bank Note Company to Crane Currencyâ€™s Swedish division (Tumba Bruk), which reportedly produced 80 million 100-Rand notes.[28] The South African Reserve Bank shredded 3.6 million 100-Rand banknotes printed by Crane Currency because they had the same serial numbers as a batch printed by the South African Bank Note Company. In addition, the notes printed in Sweden were not the correct colour, and they were 1 mm short.[29]
