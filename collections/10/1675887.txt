In addition to the Tricare options listed above, military retirees can opt for a Tricare supplement plan. Tricare supplement was designed to help military retirees and their families save money on unexpected out of pocket expenses that are not covered by Tricare. Out of pocket costs that may be alleviated by Tricare supplement can include specialists, surgeries, and hospital stays. The Tricare supplement plan can be beneficial for Tricare standard beneficiaries who are covered under a 75/25 plan that does not cover all expenses in the event of an unexpected illness or accident.
