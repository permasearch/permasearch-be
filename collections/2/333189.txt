People in Atlanta, Georgia celebrate St. Patrick's Day by holding a parade that courses through several blocks of a main portion of the city, particularly on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta.[45]  In 2012, what was called the largest Irish flag in history was used in Atlanta's parade.[45]  The St. Patrick's Day parade has been held in Atlanta since 1858.[46]  In the 2014 parade, more than 200 units participated from across the South, and as far away as Ireland.[46]
