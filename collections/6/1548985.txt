In 2004, Lincoln would make major changes to the model line. Executive Series Town Cars became sold exclusively to fleets/livery customers, while the Cartier was discontinued (after 27 years with the Town Car and the Continental Mark IV, V, and VI). To replace the Cartier, the Town Car Ultimate was introduced for 2004, featuring the THX sound system as standard. Lasting only one year, the Ultimate trim level was replaced in 2005 by Signature Limited (an option package introduced in 2000), with Signature Designer Series slotted below it. The Designer Series featured a two-tone interior with Provence leather; the rear seats included model-specific adjustable head restraints. Exterior trim of Designer Series Town Cars featured chromed B-pillars and chrome wheels. In 2008, the Designer Series was discontinued, as part of the shift from Wixom Assembly to St. Thomas Assembly.
