The 12.2-mile (19.6 km) section of US 131 freeway south of the Wexford–Osceola county line was opened on November 9, 1976, at a cost of $7.4 million (equivalent to $49.3 million in 2016[66]).[73] By 1977, the state postponed any plans to complete the freeway north of Cadillac. The department cited rising construction material costs and opposition to the freeway in Petoskey.[74][h] By the end of the decade, I-296 signs were removed from the section of freeway in Grand Rapids.[76][77] However, the freeway remains listed as a part of the Interstate Highway System.[16]
