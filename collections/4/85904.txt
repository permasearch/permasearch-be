Yes, these men and their hypnotized followers call this a "New Order." It is not new, and it is not order. For order among nations presupposes something enduring, some system of justice under which individuals over a long period of time are willing to live.

These modern tyrants find it necessary to their plans to eliminate all democracies â€” eliminate them one by one. The nations of Europe, and indeed we, ourselves, did not appreciate that purpose. We do now.[26]
