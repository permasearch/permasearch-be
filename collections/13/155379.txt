The Patriots defeated the Jets on November 22, 2012 by a score of 49â€“19. The Patriots forced five turnovers, the most bizarre of which became known as the "butt fumble", in which Mark Sanchez was flattened after running into the backside of lineman Brandon Moore and fumbling the ball to Steve Gregory, who ran back a 32-yard touchdown. This was during a sequence when the Patriots scored three touchdowns in just 52 seconds.[39] The Patriots tied the NFL record for most points in a single quarter (35) and the win was Bill Belichick's 200th career NFL win as a head coach.[40] The win nearly clinched the AFC East for the Patriots (they would clinch the title the next weekend at Miami).[citation needed]
