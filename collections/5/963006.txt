In October 1899 a Chicago group inspired by the Boston organization which had previously styled itself as the Central Anti-Imperialist League, held a convention merging with another organization to form the American Anti-Imperialist League.[12] This organization would in turn merge with the Boston-based Anti-Imperialist League in the following month, rechristening the Boston organization as the New England branch of the American Anti-Imperialist League.[8] Despite this formal organizational change, the Boston office remained the leading center of the anti-imperialist movement nationwide.[8]
