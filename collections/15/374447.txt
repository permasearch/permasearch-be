Flash flooding is the process where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods.[72] These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding[73] and are frequently (though not always) associated with intense rainfall.[74] Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments, where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena.
