Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly ranked Cambodia as his fifth-favorite season, only behind Borneo, Micronesia, Heroes vs. Villains and Cagayan. He stated that despite some confusion with the season's constantly-shifting "voting blocs" and his disappointment with some of the challenges, he found the season appealing due to "how hard the bulk of the cast was playing," while also praising the numerous twists such as the fan-vote, the idols hidden in challenges, the tribe swaps, and the vote-stealing advantage.[64] Caroline Framke of Vox raved the season, saying "The high level of game play in Survivor: Second Chance made a 15-year-old formula feel new again."[65]
