In the phase II the number of platforms will be increased to seven in total and the terminal will have a capacity to handle over three lakh passengers and as many as 270 trains daily. The total cost of the terminal is estimated to be around ₹240 crore (US$37 million) including the cost of the phase I and it would have a new Passenger Reservation system (PRS). Phase II of the Anand Vihar makeover involves linking of this terminal with the original Anand Vihar station (Station code: ANVR) which is a roadside station comprising two platforms serviced by only sub-urban trains. Northern Railways invited a consultant for Phase-II of Anand Vihar for upgrading the station with world class facilities.[31]
