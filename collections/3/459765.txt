Josh comes from Westport, Connecticut. A Fulbright scholar,[10] he graduated cum laude from Harvard University (where he worked at the Harvard Crimson), and Yale Law School,[11][12] graduating c. 1984.[13] He has been known to boast that he scored a 760 on the verbal portion of his SAT,[14] although he claims, when trying to explain his lack of skill in serious relationships, his IQ does not "break the bank," so he had to work hard in college and law school to do well.[15]
