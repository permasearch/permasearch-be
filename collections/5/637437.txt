As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays ran longer, leading to better profits and improved production values, and men began to bring their families to the theatre. The first musical theatre piece to exceed 500 consecutive performances was the French operetta The Chimes of Normandy in 1878.[27] English comic opera adopted many of the successful ideas of European operetta, none more successfully than the series of more than a dozen long-running Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, including H.M.S. Pinafore (1878) and The Mikado (1885).[33] These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic and in Australia and helped to raise the standard for what was considered a successful show.[35] These shows were designed for family audiences, a marked contrast from the risquÃ© burlesques, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that sometimes drew a crowd seeking less wholesome entertainment.[34] Only a few 19th-century musical pieces exceeded the run of The Mikado, such as Dorothy, which opened in 1886 and set a new record with a run of 931 performances. Gilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to "integrate" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue advanced a coherent story.[36][37] Their works were admired and copied by early authors and composers of musicals in Britain[38][39] and America.[35][40]
