The rivalry also manifests itself in the fact that many Scottish people support England's opponents[82][83] and vice versa,[84][85] despite the fact that England and Scotland are both countries of the United Kingdom. Whether Scots should support England against other national teams is routinely a matter of heated debate.[86][87][88] Some Scotland fans sing, "Stand up if you hate England"[89] and, "If you hate the fucking English, clap your hands",[90] while some English fans reciprocate these sentiments with, "Stand up if you hate Scotland"[91][92] and, "I’d rather be a Paki than a Jock".[92] However, the phenomenon of Scots wishing England well in international tournaments is not unknown, with a survey on the eve of the 2002 World Cup finding that one Scot in three intended to support England, while only one in six intended to support England’s opponents.[93] A survey before the 2010 World Cup found a more even divide, with 24% on each side.[88] The largest group in both surveys did not offer an opinion either way.[88][93]
