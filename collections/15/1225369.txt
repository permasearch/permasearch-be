In 1565 the Sultan rulers of the Deccan defeated Vijayanagara, the suzerain of the Nayaks, at the battle of Talikota. Vijayanagara had to abandon their capital Vijayanagara and take reestablish at Penukonda in Anantapur, then at re-establish at Vellore Fort and Chandragiri near Tirupathi, which later granted land to the British East India Company to build a fort at the present day Chennai. Finally they settled at Vellore in North Arcot. Their governors at Madurai, Kalahasti, Gingee and Tanjore still paid them tribute and other marks of respect; but in later years, when their suzerainty became weak, the Nayaks ruled independently.
