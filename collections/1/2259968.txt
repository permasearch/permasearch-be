A major example of a modernizing caudillo of the late nineteenth century is General  Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876–1911), whose period of control is known as the Porfiriato.  His slogan was “order and progress,” which was enforced by armed men controlled by the president, the Rurales.  Díaz was averse to being dependent on the Mexican army, since as a general and leader of a coup d’etat himself, he knew their potential for intervening in national politics.  Díaz coopted or crushed regional opposition to his regime, creating a political machine to forward his vision of modern Mexico.  Desirous of economic development that necessitated foreign investment, Díaz sought capital and expertise from European powers (Britain, France, and Germany) to offset the closer power of the United States.  Although elections were held in Mexico at regular intervals, they were by nature not democratic. The huge rural, illiterate, and mostly indigenous populations were more to be feared by the government than as a source for regime support. When Díaz failed to find a political solution to his succession, the Mexican Revolution erupted after blatantly fraudulent elections in 1910. Diaz came to power by a coup under the Plan of Tuxtepec and became president of Mexico 1876–1880, succeeded by his military and political compadre Manuel González (1880–1884) and returned to the presidency until he was overthrown in 1911 in the Mexican Revolution.[37]
