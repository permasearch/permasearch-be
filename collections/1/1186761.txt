Although Judas Iscariot's historical existence is generally widely accepted among secular historians,[2][3][4][5] this relative consensus has not gone entirely unchallenged.[3] The earliest possible allusion to Judas comes from the First Epistle to the Corinthians 11:23-24, in which Paul the Apostle does not mention Judas by name,[6][7] but uses the passive voice of the Greek word paradidōmi (παραδίδωμι), which most Bible translations render as "was betrayed":[6][7] "...the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread..."[6] Nonetheless, many biblical scholars argue that the word paradidōmi should be translated as "was handed over".[6][7] This translation could still refer to Judas,[6][7] but it could also instead refer to God metaphorically "handing Jesus over" to the Romans.[6]
