Considering these questions, an encampment at Valley Forge had notable advantages. Valley Forgeâ€™s high terrain meant that enemy attacks would be difficult.[11] Its location allowed for soldiers to be readily detached to protect the countryside.[12] Proximity to the Schuylkill River could facilitate supply movements down the river. Wide, open areas provided space for drilling and training.[13] On December 19, Washington conducted his 12,000-person army to Valley Forge to establish the encampment.
