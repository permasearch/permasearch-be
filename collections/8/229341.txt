Instead of attending high school for his senior year, he enrolled as a full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi International fraternity. While attending the University of Pittsburgh, he held a variety of jobs, including a bartender, disco dancing instructor, and a party promoter. He is a "beloved" fan of Pittsburgh's NFL team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.[20] After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, and graduated from the Kelley School of Business in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Management.[21][22][23] He chose Indiana's Kelley School of Business without even visiting the campus because "it had the least expensive tuition of all the business schools on the top 10 list". During college he had various business ventures, including a bar, disco lessons, and a chain letter.[7][24]
