If Mars atmospheric pressure could rise above 19 kPa (2.8 psi) then a pressure suit would not be required. Visitors would only need to wear a mask that supplied 100% oxygen under positive pressure. A further increase to 24 kPa (3.5 psi) of atmospheric pressure would allow a simple mask supplying pure oxygen.[12] This might look similar to mountain climbers who venture into pressures below 37 kPa (5.4 psi), also called the death zone where an insufficient amount of bottled oxygen has often resulted in hypoxia with fatalities.[13]
