Theresa is the reason why Jerry could not keep his wizard powers. Since wizards are not allowed to marry non-wizards, Jerry chose to give up his powers to his younger brother Kelbo in order to marry Theresa, as was revealed in season one's "Alex in the Middle" â€“ previously unbeknownst to Justin, Alex and Max. However, Jerry says he does not regret marrying her.
