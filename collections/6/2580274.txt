In the United Kingdom information about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employeeâ€™s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies.[6] The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights[7] outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.
