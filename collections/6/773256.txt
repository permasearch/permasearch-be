The tower was built during 1496 and 1497 and the mechanism of the clock was then built into it under the supervision of the Ranieri. No expense was spared in the decoration of the tower and the clock, using quantities of ultramarine and gold leaf.[8] Even the 'Moors' were originally gilded.[9] The inauguration of both tower and clock took place on 1 February 1499. Sanudo wrote in his diary for this day that the clock was uncovered and seen for the first time as the Doge was leaving the Piazza to go to hear vespers at Sta Maria Formosa, adding that it was made with great ingenuity and was most beautiful.[10] Codussi died in 1504 and the wings on either side of the tower were added by 1506 (perhaps to give greater stability to the whole).[11] Barbari's great woodcut of Venice dated 1500 shows the newly built clock tower, before the wings were built, rising high above the original 12th-century Procuratie on either side.  These Procuratie were lower than the present buildings, with only one storey above the arches on the ground floor, so that the tower then rose high above all the buildings on that side of the Piazza.
