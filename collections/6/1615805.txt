Tompall & the Glaser Brothers recorded the song in 1981. This was the group's third single following its 1980 reunion, as frontman Tompall Glaser had departed the group in 1973 for a solo career.[10] Released in mid-1981, this version of "Lovin' Her Was Easier" went on to become the group's highest-charting single.[9] It was also the title track of the Glaser brothers's reunion album, Lovin' Her Was Easier.[10] Following the release of this song, the Glaser brothers recorded only four more cuts for Elektra before disbanding a second time.
