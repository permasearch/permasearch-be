Particular targets are Europa, due to its potential for life, and Callisto, due to its relatively low radiation dose.[72][73] In 2003, NASA proposed a program called Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) that involved sending astronauts to explore the Galilean moons.[74] NASA has projected a possible attempt some time in the 2040s.[75] In the Vision for Space Exploration policy announced in January 2004, NASA discussed missions beyond Mars, mentioning that a "human research presence" may be desirable on Jupiter's moons.[76] Before the JIMO mission was cancelled, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe stated that "human explorers will follow."[77]
