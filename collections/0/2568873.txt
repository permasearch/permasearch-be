The original breakdown released to the media described Alastair as a "calm and composed demon with a placid smile that belies his simmering sadism and evil."[10] Actor Christopher Heyerdahl deemed Alastair's lack of any goodness to be "what makes him so much fun", stating, "He just unabashedly loves creating havoc and pain and thinks it's the greatest thing."[11] The breakdown also called him "one of the top demons in Hell" and "electrifyingly powerful".[10] Nicholas Knight, author of multiple supplementary books for the series, classified Alastair as a demon chief of staff at the top of the hierarchy of Hell, and suggested that the character might even be the second-oldest demon in existence in the show's mythos.[8] Writer Sera Gamble supported this characterization by explaining that Alastair, unlike other demons who have no experience with angels, is "exceptionally old and powerful, so he knows a trick or two".[12] Likewise, actor Mark Rolston called him the "John Gotti of demons".[13] However, in season twelve, the four Princes of Hell -- Azazel, Ramiel, Dagon and Asmodeus -- were revealed to be the next four demons created after Lilith, debunking the idea that Alastair was the second demon ever created.
