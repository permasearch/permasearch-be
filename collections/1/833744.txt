It has been statistically demonstrated that screening programs are effective in reducing the number of deaths caused by colon cancer due to adenomatous polyps. While there are risks of complications associated with colonoscopies, those risks are extremely low at approximately 0.35 percent. For comparison, the lifetime risk of developing colon cancer is around 6 percent.[13] As there is a small likelihood of recurrence, surveillance after polyp removal is recommended.
