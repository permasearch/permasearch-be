Bellatrix later becomes the main antagonist in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1. The first chapter of the book implies that Voldemort has yet to forgive Bellatrix for her failure, as he mocks her with the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf Remus Lupin.[15] However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to "prune" her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the Dursleys' home; during the attack, Bellatrix devotes much of her energies in efforts to kill Tonks, but is unsuccessful.[16] In this book, Bellatrix inadvertently reveals she is the guardian of Helga Hufflepuff's cup, when the captured Harry, Ron, and Hermione are brought to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse, believing them to have sneaked into her vault at Gringotts due to their possession of Godric Gryffindor's Sword, but Dobby appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion, to gain access to the Lestranges' Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his hunt for Elder Wand only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. Rowling stated in an interview that, during the battle, it was Bellatrix who killed Tonks.[3] When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, proving more than a match for all three, and nearly hits Ginny with a Killing Curse. An enraged Molly Weasley engages Bellatrix and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.[17] Rowling has stated that she had Molly kill Bellatrix to show Molly's great powers as a witch and to confront Molly's consumption with "maternal love" and Bellatrix's obsession with Voldemort.[18]
