Under Jadid's rule, Syria aligned itself with the Soviet bloc and pursued hardline policies towards Israel[32] and "reactionary" Arab states especially Saudi Arabia, calling for the mobilization of a "people's war" against Zionism rather than inter-Arab military alliances. Domestically, Jadid attempted a socialist transformation of Syrian society at forced pace, creating unrest and economical difficulties. Opponents of the government were harshly suppressed, while the Ba'ath Party replaced parliament as law-making body and other parties were banned. Public support for his government, such as it was, declined sharply following Syria's defeat in the 1967 Six Day War,[33] when Israel destroyed much of Syria's air force and captured the Golan Heights.[34][35]
