Mackenzie's successor, Bishop Tozer, relocated the society's base to Zanzibar in 1864. Here they enjoyed much greater success, receiving a cordial welcome from the island's Arab and African residents, and establishing a number of operations, including a mission school,[5] St Andrew's at Kiungani.[10] The mission's early work in Zanzibar substantially involved caring for and schooling children rescued from slavery,[11] and establishing a settlement - Mbweni, founded 1871 - for these released slaves to live in.[12] On Christmas Day, 1873, the foundation stone of Christ Church was laid in the grounds of the former slave market, closed only six months earlier.[13] It was completed in time for Christmas 1880 and a mass celebrated there.[14][15] Miss Annie Allen came to the Zanzibar Mission in 1878 and later came to consider it home. Here she created a Zenana Mission that served many women and children.[16]
