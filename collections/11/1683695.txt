The Babylonians, who were famous for their astronomical observations and calculations (aided by their invention of the abacus),  used a sexagesimal (base-60) positional numeral system inherited from either the Sumerian or the Eblaite civilizations.[1] Neither of the predecessors was a positional system (having a convention for which ‘end’ of the numeral represented the units).
