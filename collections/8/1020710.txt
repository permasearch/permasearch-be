In 1990, McKean landed a memorable role opposite Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Hopper in the American adventure comedy movie, Flashback. That same year, McKean was part of an ensemble cast in the television series Grand on NBC which, however, only aired for a short time. In 1991 McKean co-wrote (with Christopher Guest) the second episode and later directed the final episode of the mock documentary series Morton & Hayes, created by Phil Mishkin and Rob Reiner.
