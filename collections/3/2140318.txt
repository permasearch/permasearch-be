According to some scholars, school assignment policies should primarily focus on socioeconomic integration rather than racial integration. As Richard D. Kahlenberg writes, "Racial integration is a very important aim, but if one's goal is boosting academic achievement, what really matters is economic integration." [27] Kahlenberg refers to a body of research showing that the low overall socioeconomic status of a school is clearly linked to less learning for students, even after controlling for age, race, and family socioeconomic status. In particular, the socioeconomic composition of a school may lead to lower student achievement through its effect on "school processes," such as academic climate and teachers' expectations of students' ability to learn.[28] If reforms could equalize these school processes across schools, socioeconomic and racial integration policies might not be necessary to close achievement gaps.[28] Sociologist Amy Stuart Wells, however, argues that the original intent of school desegregation was to improve blacksâ€™ access to important social institutions and opportunities, thereby improving their long-run life outcomes.[29] Discussions about ending racial integration policies, though, largely focus on the relationship between integration and short-run outcomes such as test scores.[29] In Stuart's view, long-term outcomes should be emphasized in order to appreciate the true social importance of integration.
