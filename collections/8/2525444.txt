Ruger manufactures several "convertible" models that ship with both a .22 LR cylinder and .22 WMR cylinder, allowing the use of both cartridges.[3] The .22 Short and .22 Long cartridges can also be fired in the Long Rifle cylinder. For those models that ship with both cylinders, the last 3 digits of the serial number are engraved on the front of the cylinder; only cylinders that have been properly timed should be used with any given revolver. The term Super Single-Six refers to those models which have fully adjustable target sights.
