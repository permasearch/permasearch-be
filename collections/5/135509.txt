In many ways Mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict, the Greek counterattack.[165] After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.[166] The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians.[166] The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians.[167] Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.[167] Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.[167]
