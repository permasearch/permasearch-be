The episode's musical performances were given a better reception than the episode as a whole, though there were some dissenting voices, and not every song was received with the same enthusiasm. Slezak described the episode as "jam-packed with terrific song-and-dance numbers", and Votta wrote that "the musical numbers themselves were strong, fantastical and poignant to the story".[35][36] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times declared, "The music was good; the dancing, better."[38] Chaney wrote that "too many" of the musical numbers were "weak imitations", which was reflected in her grading: her median grade for the nine numbers was a "C+", and her highest grade was a single "B+".[33]
