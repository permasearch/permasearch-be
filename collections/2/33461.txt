The presence of Vikings in Galicia took place at the earliest by the mid-ninth century though apparently not before[56], and no later than the twelfth century, when Vikings from Scandinavia were a naval and military power, launching expeditions of plunder and conquest by the Atlantic coast and European rivers, looting cities and settlements. The Vikings extended their journeys all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, and on the way they raided Galicia. In contemporary texts, the Vikings are often referred to as normandos or lordimani.
