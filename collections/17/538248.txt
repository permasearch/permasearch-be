In Northern America, revolution was beginning when in 1770, British troops opened fire on a mob pelting them with stones, an event later known as the Boston Massacre.[29] British authorities were unable to determine if this event was a local one, or signs of something bigger[30] until, in 1775, Rebel forces confirmed their intentions by attacking British troops on Bunker Hill.[31] Shortly after, Massachusetts Second Continental Congress representative John Adams and his cousin Samuel Adams were part of a group calling for an American Declaration of Independence. The Congress ended without committing to a Declaration, but prepared for conflict by naming George Washington as the Continental Army Commander.[30] War broke out and lasted until 1783, when Britain signed the Treaty of Paris and recognized America's independence.[32] In 1788, the states ratified the United States Constitution, going from a confederation to a union[30] and in 1789, elected George Washington as the first President of the United States.[33]
