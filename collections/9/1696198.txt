The Homelessness Research Institute (HRI), the research arm of the National Alliance to End Homelessness uses the definition for "homelessness" or "homeless" set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which considers an individual homeless if he or she lives in an emergency shelter, transitional housing program, haven, or a place not meant for human habitation, such as a car, abandoned buildings, or on the street.  Continuums of Care (CoCs) are the local or regional planning bodies that coordinate services and funding for individuals and families experiencing homelessness."[11]
