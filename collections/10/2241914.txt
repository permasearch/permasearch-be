On surviving Ancient Egyptian cubit-rods, the royal cubit is divided into seven palms of four digits or fingers each.[10] Five digits are equal to a hand, with thumb; and six to a closed fist.[11] The royal cubit measured approximately 525 mm,[12] so the length of the ancient Egyptian hand was about 94 mm.
