Since the global financial crisis of 2007â€“08, policies similar to those undertaken by Japan have been used by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Eurozone. Quantitative easing was used by these countries because their risk-free short-term nominal interest rates were either at or close to zero. In the United States, this interest rate is termed the federal funds rate; in the United Kingdom, it is termed the official bank rate.
