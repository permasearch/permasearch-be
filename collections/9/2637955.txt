Manchukuo (traditional Chinese: 滿洲國; pinyin: Mǎnzhōuguó; Japanese: 満州国; "State of Manchuria") was a puppet state of the Empire of Japan in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia from 1932 until 1945. It was initially governed as a republic, but in 1934 it became a constitutional monarchy. It had limited international recognition and was de facto under the control of Japan.
