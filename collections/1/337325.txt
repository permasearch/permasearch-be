Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post gave the first anime episode a B+ and said "I’ll admit that the concept is familiar and at the same time goofy, but there’s a certain quality about it that’s charming, sexy and has the potential to be a hell of a lot of fun."[13] He give later episodes B's, writing that "the show does feel like it’s trying to be a bit educational though it tends to fall more on the whole titillation side more than anything else."[14] In his review of episode 9, he wrote that "the show takes things further than reality would in a lot of ways, there’s a lot of fun in just having characters that actually acknowledge some form of sexuality that exists." and summarized the series as "Silly and serious but with a great dose of a fanservice, this show is just a delight to watch."[15] In reviewing the final episode, he wrote "It does things that most shows are afraid to even think of, never mind even trying a fraction of doing when it comes to character relationships, intimacy and sexuality."[16]
