Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through the Dead Marshes while evading the Nazgûl. They reach the Black Gate to Mordor, but Gollum, finding himself becoming loyal to Frodo for his kindness, stops them from approaching, stating that it's too risky and that there is another entrance. Frodo and Sam are later captured by the Rangers of Ithilien, led by Faramir, brother of the late Boromir. When Faramir discovers that Frodo has the Ring, he intends to take him to Gondor. Faramir also captures Gollum when Frodo exposes him. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli travel to Rohan’s capital of Edoras, where Gandalf releases Théoden from Saruman’s influence, and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with an army of Uruk-hai, Théoden decides to move his citizens to Helm's Deep, an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim led by Théoden's nephew, Éomer. Aragorn builds a friendship with Théoden’s niece, Éowyn, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. During a Warg attack, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river, but is found by his horse Brego and taken to Helm’s Deep.
