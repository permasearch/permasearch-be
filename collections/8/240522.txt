In November 2017, it was revealed that a data breach, which occurred in 2016, disclosed personal information on about 600,000 drivers, including license information, and names, email addresses, and phone numbers for 57 million customers. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data.[539][540] The company was subsequently criticized for concealing the loss of data and that concealment could lead to the imposition of higher fines, particularly if the act was intentional.[541] Newly appointed Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi apologized saying in an email statement "None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it."[542] He added that "we are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers."[543]
