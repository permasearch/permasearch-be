Werewolves in the Underworld films, like their vampire counterparts, are biologically immortal transgenics. Lycans display a number of greatly enhanced physical attributes in either form (superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, healing, etc.) although the werewolf form is physically superior to both their human form and even to most vampires. Lycans are highly allergic to silver, to the point of it being toxic and lethal to them, and it is even able to keep them weakened and unable to transform into their werewolf form. They can also be killed or permanently damaged by extreme physical trauma as normal humans are, such as mutilation, a broken neck, or dismemberment, especially if their head or heart is destroyed or removed. However, while first generation werewolves sired by William Corvinus are permanently transformed and feral, second generation werewolves, the Lycans, and those they convert, can become able to change between their human or werewolf forms at will and retain their personalities while transformed. Their control over their transformation increases overtimes, to the point where they can partially transform to physically enhance themselves further, while age also gives them a limited tolerance to silver. As explained by Selene in the first Underworld film though, a bite from both a Lycan and a vampire is lethal, but Michael's heritage allows him to survive and become a hybrid of both species.
