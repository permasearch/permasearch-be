Just Add Magic is an American live-action family television series, loosely based on the book of the same name by Cindy Callaghan.[1] It was produced by Amazon Studios. A pilot was produced in 2015 and the series commissioned for a full season the following year.[2] Amazon renewed the series for a second season in June 2016 after it "set a record as the most successful Amazon Original Kids premiere weekend in terms of U.S. Prime Video streams and hours."[3]
