Two 302 V8s were available, a carbureted version (manual transmission cars), or a new 165 hp (123 kW) electronically fuel-injected engine (automatic-transmission cars).  A new "Quadra-Shock" rear suspension, which replaced the slapper bars with horizontally mounted axle shocks, became available after a few months of production. After 1984, the TRX option was retired for the Mustang.
