Morton’s was co-founded in 1978 by Arnold J. Morton and Klaus Fritsch.[9] Before they became friends and restaurant entrepreneurs, Morton and Fritsch worked together at the Playboy Club in Montreal. While the club was in the process of changing its menu, Fritsch prepared a hamburger for Morton to sample. Morton said the burger was the best he’d ever tasted. Together, they opened Morton’s of Chicago in Newberry Plaza in Downtown Chicago. The original location remains open.[10][11][12]
