Autonomous vehicles may use lidar for obstacle detection and avoidance to navigate safely through environments, using rotating laser beams.[48] Cost map or point cloud outputs from the lidar sensor provide the necessary data for robot software to determine where potential obstacles exist in the environment and where the robot is in relation to those potential obstacles. Singapore's Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) is actively developing technologies for autonomous lidar vehicles.[49] Examples of companies that produce lidar sensors commonly used in robotics or vehicle automation are Sick[50] and Hokuyo.[51] Examples of obstacle detection and avoidance products that leverage lidar sensors are the Autonomous Solution, Inc. Forecast 3D Laser System[52] and Velodyne HDL-64E.[53]
