A seventh-season episode of the Discovery Channel series MythBusters explored a story of Crockett's backwoods exploits: that he could stick an axe into a tree trunk, fire his long rifle from 40 yards (37 m) away, and hit the edge so precisely that the bullet would split in two. After some practice, Tory Belleci was able to duplicate the feat from 20 yards (18 m) with the gun resting on sandbags and declared the myth "Confirmed", reasoning that Crockett could have consistently made the 40-yard (37 m) shot with enough experience.[citation needed]
