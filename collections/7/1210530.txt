Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee would arrange for the heroes and their families to be flown in via military aircraft.[14] 100 members from 31 states would attend the race with Thomas J. Kelly the president of The Medal of Honor Society as the grand marshal.[15] With success France Sr. invited them on two more occasions in 1971 and 1973, won by Bobby Isaac and David Pearson respectively.[8][16][17]
