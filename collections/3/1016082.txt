On August 22, 2017, pre-orders officially opened at several major retailers, causing many of their sites to crash before customers could buy the system, as well as at physical GameStop locations in limited amounts, which also sold out quickly on a first-come, first-served basis.[25] The Target website became "glitched out", removing the items from users' carts,[25] and pre-orders from Walmart were sold out in less than a minute.[26] This led to Nintendo of America being criticized as "inept or underhanded", and that they contributed to a "chaotic" situation.[25]
