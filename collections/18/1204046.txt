Meanwhile, European manufacturers, gone from the Indianapolis 500 for nearly two decades, made a brief return just before World War II, with the competitive Maserati 8CTF allowing Wilbur Shaw to become the first driver to win consecutively at Indianapolis, in 1939 and 1940.[21] With the 500 having been a part of the Formula One World Drivers' Championship between 1950 and 1960,[22][23] Ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with Alberto Ascari,[24] but European entries were few and far between during those days. Among the Formula One drivers who did drive at the speedway was five-time world champion, Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio, though he failed to qualify for the 1958 race.
