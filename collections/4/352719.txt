After a meet-and-greet for the cast in June 1977, filming began the following month.[4] "The first thing we did was a filming block on location in North Yorkshire," explained Peter Davison. "I just remember driving up and seeing this beautiful countryside that I'd never seen before. It was untouched. Initially we stayed in a little place called West Witton in Wensleydale, in between Leyburn and Askrigg. Robert Hardy always stayed [in Low Row] near Reeth, where he'd found this rather grand little bed and breakfast place. He would invite us around for dinner and would normally be sat there working on the script and would go in the next day, bang it on the table and say, 'I've rewritten this, here it is!' It was usually better."
