Cocaine causes impaired growth of the fetus's brain, an effect that is most pronounced with high levels of cocaine and prolonged duration of exposure throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy.[41] Studies that use neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FMRI have shown differences in brain structure of PCE children, for example in the cerebral cortex and limbic system.[14] Those PCE children who had slowed brain growth as fetuses are at higher risk for impaired brain growth and motor, language and attention problems after they are born.[41] Studies have found that children exposed to cocaine during fetal development experience problems with language, behavior, development, and attention.[20][42] However these effects are small, especially when studies control for other factors like exposure to other drugs.[20] Cognitive and attention skills can be impacted by PCE, possibly due to effects on brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex.[12] Brain areas in the frontal lobe involved in dealing with stress, attention, and impulsiveness seem to be particularly impacted by PCE, as evidenced by neuroimaging studies that show abnormalities in these areas of the brain.[8] PCE infants have been shown to be more jittery and excitable and have lower arousal and self-regulation; such behavioral effects may persist or worsen after 12 months of age.[14] Children whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy may develop symptoms akin to those of attention deficit disorder,[12] and a link has been found between the disorder itself and PCE.[43] Mild deficits in language have been found in older PCE children.[27] Language development is impaired, possibly into late adolescence, but adolescents up to age 17 may improve their receptive language skills.[14]
