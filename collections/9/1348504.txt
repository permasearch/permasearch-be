India's economically exploitable and viable hydroelectric potential is estimated to be 148,701 MW.[6][7] An additional 6,780 MW from smaller hydro schemes (with capacities of less than 25 MW) is estimated as exploitable.[8] 56 sites for pumped storage schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of 94,000 MW have also been identified. In central India, the hydroelectric power potential from the Godavari, Mahanadi, Nagavali, Vamsadhara and Narmada river basins has not been developed on a major scale due to potential opposition from the tribal population.[9]
