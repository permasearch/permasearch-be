The Emblem Glyph of Calakmul has a greater distribution than the Emblem Glyph of any other Maya city. The Glyph is also found in more hieroglyphic texts than any other Emblem Glyph, including that of Tikal.[14] Calakmul administered a large domain marked by the extensive distribution of their emblem glyph of the snake head sign,[15] to be read "Kaan".[16] Calakmul was the seat of what has been dubbed the Snake Kingdom.[17] At times the city had governance over places as far away as 150 kilometers.[7]
