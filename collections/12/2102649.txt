As its name suggests, an emphasis was put on reducing weight. The M3 CSL has a curb weight of 1,385 kg (3,053 lb), 110 kg (240 lb) lighter than the regular M3.[40][41][42] The CSL features many weight saving technologies taken from BMW's Formula One racing applications.[43] A large proportion of the M3s sound insulation has been removed, along with electric seats and navigation systems.[38] Air conditioning and stereo systems could be retrofitted free of cost, but were not available standard.[41] The CSL's unique body pieces are all crafted from carbon fibre reinforced polymer.[40] Glass-reinforced plastics are used throughout structural points in the car.[41] The standard rear window was replaced with one made from thinner glass.[44] Although the CSL loses a considerable amount of curb weight from its original version, the focus was put on strategically reducing or moving the weight in the car rather than the raw amount of weight that could be lost.[45] This is to retain the ideal 50:50 weight distribution characteristics the E46 has.[40] For example, the roof is constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastic.[40] While this only reduces the curb weight of the car by 7 kg (15 lb), it lowers the centre of gravity of the car and decreases body flex.[39][45]
