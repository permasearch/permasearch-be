The Manx breed shows behaviors like puppies, such as coming when their owners whistle or call their names. They are known for jumping and climbing about obstacles as well as burying things, even collecting and burying toys at times. Manx felines will also display strong affection generally. Dr. David Taylor, writer and founder of the founder of International Zoo Veterinary Group, said they are "positively dog-like".[6][8]
