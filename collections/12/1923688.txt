The show is animated in the software Toon Boom Harmony, which kept crashing constantly during the episode's production. This was due in large part to the shots where, ultimately, 64 separate realities play out onscreen. The overload of layers and elements would cause the software to crash. The final episode was the result of multiple composited shots, stitched together: "They basically had to output it and then rotoscope over the top of it in order to get the final fixes in," Roiland said.[2] There are subtle differences in several but not all duplicated shots.[22] When the in-house animation unit for Rick and Morty would receive shots back from their international partner, Bardel Entertainment, they would attempt to edit shots further for more variety.[23] To finalize single shots, a computer would have to be out of service for nearly fourteen hours to complete rendering.[17] In one instance, a layer went missing nearing the end of a shot, necessitating another full composite.[24]
