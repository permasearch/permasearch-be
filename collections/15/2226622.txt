Uganda introduced legislation in 2007 to ban the sale of lightweight plastic bags under 30 µm thick and tax thicker bags at a punitive rate of 120%. Although the laws came into effect in September of that year,[52] they have not been enforced and have failed to measurably reduce the use of plastic bags.[53] The law is not well enforced.[54]
