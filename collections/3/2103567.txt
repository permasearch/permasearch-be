Batroc the Leaper appears in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, portrayed by French Canadian former UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre.[39] He appears as an Algerian mercenary who is holding a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship hostage. Captain America, Black Widow and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents rescue the hostages. Batroc then has a fight with Captain America but is eventually defeated, and later escapes. He is captured by Alexander Goodwin Pierce and brought in for questioning, but is seen to remain silent during interrogation. Nick Fury later reveals he hired Batroc to hijack the ship to give him an excuse to send Black Widow on board so she could steal confidential S.H.I.E.L.D. files pointing to a Hydra conspiracy that involved Hydra infiltrators within S.H.I.E.L.D.
