For the onscreen confirmation that Xavier is Haller's father in "Chapter 7", with Xavier's signature wheelchair shown in a brief flashback, the series' production was able to choose from any of the variant wheelchairs used throughout the film series. They settled on the version from X-Men: Apocalypse, with the prop used in that film being brought out of storage for the show.[40][21] Discussing a potential appearance by the character in the series' second season, Hawley said, "any person who learns they were adopted is going to have his questions and want to speak out to those parents, to his birth parents, I think that's a very natural story ... that's definitely something that we're going to approach." He added that this would be both a creative and corporate decision, in terms of the "movie studio and their relationship to the X-Men, and characters they want in the movies and want to protect. And were we to want to have Professor X on the show as Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy ... that's a conversation with the actor and the studio."[23]
