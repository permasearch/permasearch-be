Before the fountain was completed in 2004, Art Institute of Chicago president James Wood felt the columns would be too tall and other community leaders felt that the height and scale of the project stemmed from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.[57] Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by "forever open, clear and free" legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings.[12][58][59][60] Aaron Montgomery Ward twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones.[61]  As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park.  However, Crown Fountain and Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which stands 139 feet (42Â m) tall, were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures.[62]
