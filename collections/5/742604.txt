Diseases affecting cardiac muscle are of immense clinical significance, and are the leading cause of death in developed nations.[23] The most common condition affecting cardiac muscle is ischaemic heart disease, in which the blood supply to the heart is reduced. In ischaemic heart disease, the coronary arteries become narrowed by atherosclerosis. If these narrowings gradually become severe enough to partially restrict blood flow, the syndrome of angina pectoris may occur. This typically causes chest pain during exertion that is relieved by rest. If a coronary artery suddenly becomes very narrowed or completed blocked, interrupting or severely reducing blood flow, a myocardial infarction or heart attack occurs. If the occlusion is not relieved promptly by medication, percutaneous coronary intervention, or surgery, then a region of heart muscle may become permanently scarred and damaged.
