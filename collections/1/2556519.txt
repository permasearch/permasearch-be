In 1957â€“58, a State Senate Interim Committee investigation revealed that little had been done to prepare Indian reserves for termination.[11] In 1958, the Rancheria Termination Act was enacted. A memo from the Department of Interior shows the insufficiency of the notice given the California Indians, which was simply posted on the Rancheria for 30 days.[12] In many testimonies, like that of the Nisenen of the Nevada City Rancheria plaintiffs alleged that BIA officials spoke only to whoever was occupying the homestead at the time, rather than consulting with Indians living in the surrounding area.[13]
