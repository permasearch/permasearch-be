In accordance with the origins of the Order, and considered more consistent with ordained ministry than the military title of Knight, invested clergy are ipso facto Titular Canons of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (however, the late Grand Master John Cardinal Foley argued that this would be better applied to clergy with the rank of Commander).[42] Additionally, deacons, priests and bishops may also receive the distinguished honorary title of Canon of the Holy Sepulchre personally by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.[43] Both Titular Canons of the Holy Sepulchre (EOHSJ) and Honorary Canons of the Holy Sepulchre of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem are entitled to identical insignia, i.e. white mozetta with red Jerusalem cross and choir dress including the black cassock with magenta piping and magenta fascia.[44]
