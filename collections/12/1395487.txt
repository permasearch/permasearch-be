McGrady was known for his laid-back demeanor and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname "The Big Sleep".[73] Many of his contemporaries, including Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce, have called him one of the most difficult players that they ever had to guard.[74][75] His playing style has been compared to that of George Gervin; both players made scoring appear easy with their "smooth" approach to the game.[73] At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense;[76] in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe elaborated, "He glided through the lane, crouched into traffic, and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim."[77] McGrady would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders, making him a threat to score from anywhere on the court.[76] These qualities, in addition to his ability to survey the floor and make accurate pocket passes when necessary, have led analysts to describe him as being ahead of his time; in 2017, ESPN's Amin Elhassan remarked that McGrady was built for the style of positionless basketball that was being played in the modern era.[77] On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady's effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level in meaningful games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.[7]
