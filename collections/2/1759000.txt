In 1854, Washington became one of the first territories to attempt granting voting rights to women; the legislative measure was defeated by only one vote.  In 1871, the Washington Women's Suffrage Association was formed, largely attributable to a crusade through Washington and Oregon led by Susan B. Anthony and Abigail Scott Duniway.  The late nineteenth century saw a seesaw of bills passed by the Territorial Legislature and subsequently overturned by the Territorial Supreme Court, as the competing interests of the suffrage movement and the liquor industry (which was being damaged by the women's vote) battled over the issue.  The first successful bill passed in 1883 (overturned in 1887), the next in 1888 (overturned the same year).  The women's suffrage movement next hoped to secure the right to vote via voter referendum, first in 1889 (the same year Washington achieved statehood), and again in 1898, but both referendum bids were unsuccessful.  A constitutional amendment finally granted women the right to vote in 1910.[27][28][29]
