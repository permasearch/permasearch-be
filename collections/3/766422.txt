In December 1998, researchers from Emory University conducted an experimental bone marrow transplant procedure on a group of 22 children under 16 years old.[105] One of those patients, 12-year-old Keone Penn, was apparently the first person to be cured of sickle-cell disease through this method.[106] The stem cells were sourced from a donor unrelated to Penn. A 2007 Georgia Senate bill proposing the collection and donation of stem cell material, the "Saving the Cure Act", was nicknamed "Keone's Law" in his honor.[107]
