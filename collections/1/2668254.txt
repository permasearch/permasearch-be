The first reported bird strike was by Orville Wright in 1905. According to the Wright Brothers' diaries, "Orville â€¦ flew 4,751 meters in 4 minutes 45 seconds, four complete circles. Twice passed over fence into Beard's cornfield. Chased flock of birds for two rounds and killed one which fell on top of the upper surface and after a time fell off when swinging a sharp curve."[5]
