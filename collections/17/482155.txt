From the Umayyad through the Mamluk period the lake was known in Arabic as "Bahr al-Minya", the "Sea of Minya", after the Umayyad qasr complex whose ruins are still visible at Khirbat al-Minya. This is the name employed by the medieval Persian and Arab scholars Al-Baladhuri, Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir.[11]
