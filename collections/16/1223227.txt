The cohesive Chacoan system began unravelling around 1140, perhaps triggered by an extreme fifty-year drought that began in 1130;[26] chronic climatic instability, including a series of severe droughts, again struck the region between 1250 and 1450.[27] Poor water management led to arroyo cutting; deforestation was extensive and economically devastating:[28][29][30] timber for construction had to be hauled instead from outlying mountain ranges such as the Chuska mountains, which are more than 50 miles (80Â km) to the west.[31] Outlying communities began to depopulate and, by the end of the century, the buildings in the central canyon had been neatly sealed and abandoned.[citation needed]
