Germany marched through neutral Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan to invade France, and by August 23 had reached the French border town of Maubeuge, whose true significance lay within its forts.[7] Maubeuge was a major railway junction and was consequently a protected city.[7] It had 15 forts and gun batteries, totaling 435 guns, along with a permanent garrison of 35,000 troops, a number enhanced by the British Expeditionary Force.[7] The BEF and the French Fifth Army retreated on August 23, and the town was besieged by German heavy artillery starting on August 25.[7] The fortress was surrendered on September 7 by General Fournier, who was later court-martialed, but exonerated, for the capitulation.[7]
