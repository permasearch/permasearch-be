IU took on various side-projects after the end of Dream High. On March 10, 2011, IU performed as the opening act for British singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's first solo concert in Seoul with two songs, before joining Bailey Rae during her performance of "Put Your Records On".[61] Bailey Rae, whom IU described as her role model, said of IU, "It's incredible that her voice is so soulful even though she's young."[62] In the same month, IU was appointed as one of the new hosts of the music program, Inkigayo, a position which she held until July 2013.[63] For K.Will's extended play album, My Heart Beating, she starred in two of his music videos alongside Lee Joon and No Min-woo.[64][65] In May 2011, IU recorded her first self-composed song, "Hold My Hand" (Korean: 내 손을 잡아), for the romantic-comedy television series, The Greatest Love (Korean: 최고의 사랑).[66] Since it was the first time she had written a song not for herself but at the behest of the drama's producers, IU found the experience difficult as she had to match the drama's cheerful tone.[67] The song peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and sold 2,031,787 digital copies in 2011.[57][68] Between May and July 2011, IU took part in the reality ice-skating competition series, Kim Yuna's Kiss & Cry, as a celebrity contestant until she was eliminated in the eighth episode.[69][70] During this time, she also participated in Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend but eventually withdrew after recording one episode due to her overwhelming schedule.[71][72] On her wide-ranging activities in entertainment, IU remarked that while singing, acting and variety are all difficult, she finds variety to be the most tiring.[67]
