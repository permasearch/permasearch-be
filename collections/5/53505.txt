The first surgical removal of a gallstone (cholecystolithotomy) was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously occurring biliary fistula.[30] Stough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded cholecystotomy,[32] although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French surgeon Jean Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century.[30] German surgeon Carl Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis.[31] Before this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones.[30] Langenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal has no gallbladder, humans could survive without one.[30]
