Hudson, Bess, Loraine, and George were lost in the sinking. Whether or not George found the Allisons and informed them that Trevor was safely off the ship is unknown, but if he did, it is likely the information came too late for any of them to leave the ship. Bess was one of only four first-class women (including Ida Straus and Edith Corse Evans) who perished, while Loraine was the only child of first and second class to do so. Hudson's body was the 135th recovered by the Mackay-Bennett; George's was the 294th. Hudson's was brought to be buried in the family plot in Maple Ridge Cemetery near Winchester, Ontario.[citation needed]
