The Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway was incorporated in May 1870 in Junction City, Kansas. Ostensibly the original goal of the company was to build a supply railroad connecting the frontier military bases of Fort Riley, Fort Gibson and Fort Scott; and eventually Fort Worth; although its broader ambitions were to also connect to Chicago and New Orleans.[1] Upon its incorporation the MK&T acquired the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch (est. 1865) and its 182 miles (293Â km) of track in Kansas. (Union Pacific Railway was, for a period of several years in the late 19th century, the official name of the unrelated Union Pacific Railroad, which later acquired MKT as part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad.)
