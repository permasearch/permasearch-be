Macroautophagy is the main pathway, used primarily to eradicate damaged cell organelles or unused proteins.[30] This involves the formation of a double membrane known as an autophagosome, around the organelle marked for destruction.[28][31] The autophagosome then travels through the cytoplasm of the cell to a lysosome, and the two organelles fuse.[28] Within the lysosome, the contents of the autophagosome are degraded via acidic lysosomal hydrolases.[32]
