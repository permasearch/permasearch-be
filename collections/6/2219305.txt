In 1947 Edward H. Land introduced the Polaroid-Land process.[1] The first instant films produced sepia tone photos.[2] A negative sheet is exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed through a set of rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film "sandwich". The negative develops quickly, after which some of the unexposed silver halide grains (and the latent image it contains) are solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, depending on film type and ambient temperature, the negative is peeled away to reveal the picture which was transferred to the positive receiving sheet.[3] True black and white films were released in 1950 after problems with chemistry stabilization were overcome.[2]
