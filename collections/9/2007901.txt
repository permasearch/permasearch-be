Originally, in the Freddy vs. Jason script written by Damian Shannon and Mark J. Swift, Tina Gray appears in Lori Campbell's first nightmare of Freddy Krueger. Bloody, affixed to the ceiling, and still clothed in her blue nightshirt, Tina tells Lori the following: "Freddy is coming back. It's okay to be afraid, Lori. We were all afraid. Warn your friends...warn all your friends."[11]
