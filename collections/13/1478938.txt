Loading a cylinder in this manner was a slow and awkward process and generally could not be done in the midst of battle.[31] Some soldiers solved this by carrying multiple revolvers in the field. Another solution was to use a revolver with a detachable cylinder design. These revolvers allowed the shooter to quickly remove a cylinder and replace it with a full one.[17]
