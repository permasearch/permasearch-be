The film was directed by Forest Whitaker, written by Jessica Bendinger, Kate Kondell, and Jerry O'Connell, and produced by John Davis. Whitaker likened First Daughter to a fairy tale, characterizing it as "the story of a princess who leaves the 'castle' [the White House] to go out in the world to discover who and what she is."[2] The film had languished in "development hell" for several years, and was further delayed even after its completion.[citation needed] The film was not a commercial success upon its eventual release, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews.
