The fourth episode is also the first time we really see that Jeff Randall is a womaniser, followed up in the sixth episode "Just for the Record" where he is surrounded by beautiful women at a beauty contest, offering Miss Moscow "a cup of tea" as a cover for sex. Even when Jeff does not physically make contact with attractive women it is clear there is always a mutual attraction between them, for example in the 17th episode "Somebody Just Walked Over My Grave" where he flirts with the housekeeper.
