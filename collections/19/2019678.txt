The WPK maintains a leftist image[93] and normally sends a delegation to the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, where it receives some support;[94] its 2011 resolution, "Let us jointly commemorate the Birth Centenary of the Great Leader comrade President Kim Il Sung as a Grand Political Festival of the Worldâ€™s Humankind", was signed by 30 of the 79 attending parties.[95] The WPK also sees itself as part of the worldwide leftist and socialist movement; during the Cold War, the WPK and North Korea had a policy of "exporting revolution", aiding leftist guerrillas worldwide. However, others argue the WPK ideology is xenophobic nationalist or far-right.[96][97][98]
