Thompson's first draft was more than three hundred handwritten pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length.[23][24] She found the romances to be the most difficult to "juggle",[24] and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward sidelined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that "if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those peopleÂ ... then it wasn't going to work."[25] At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting "a couple of women waiting around for men";[26] gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.[27]
