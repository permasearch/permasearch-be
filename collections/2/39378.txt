In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change.[94] In 1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government.[94] It was not until 1958 that Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group.[94]
