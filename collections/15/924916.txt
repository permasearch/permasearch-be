A taxpayer may rely on a covered opinion by a licensed or enrolled tax adviser to avoid certain penalties. A covered opinion includes any written tax advice not otherwise disclaimed in the advice, with certain exceptions. The disclaimer must prominently state that the advice was not "intended or written by the practitioner to be used, and that it cannot be used by the taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer."[13]
