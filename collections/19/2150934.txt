The Spartans put the nail in the coffin on the opening drive of the second half after a 21-yard pass from Connor Cook to DeAnthony Arnett gave MSU a 24-point lead. Western scored two late touchdowns, but a Vayante Copeland interception in the end zone late in the game put an end to the Broncos' comeback attempt.
