Khat contains the alkaloid cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a drug of abuse that can produce psychological dependence,[2] although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be seriously problematic.[3] The plant has been targeted by anti-drug organizations such as the DEA.[4] It is a controlled substance in some countries, such as Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States (de facto), while its production, sale, and consumption are legal in other nations, including Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen.[5] Consumption of the plant's leaves in its natural state is also permitted in Israel.[6] Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.[3]
