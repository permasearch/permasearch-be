Gould and his producing partner helped make Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), later selling it to United Artists. He was reportedly offered the lead role in Pocket Money, but turned it down because he did not want to work with director Stuart Rosenberg again after his experience making Move.[9] His comeback came in 1973's The Long Goodbye,[10] Robert Altman's adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel. Gould starred as detective Philip Marlowe, a role which had previously been played by such actors as Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell in the fifties. By comparison, Gould's performance was more naturalistic, with the screenplay by Leigh Brackett (who had previously adapted The Big Sleep for Howard Hawks and Bogart) updating the setting to contemporary Los Angeles. Although not a major hit, the film was later regarded as one of Gould's best.[citation needed]
