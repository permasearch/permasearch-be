A brief recession followed the war, but prosperity returned by 1786. Those who remained benefited from the exodus of many Loyalists who left behind their land and businesses.[72] Almost twenty percent of Americans had remained loyal to the Britain, and as many as 80,000 of these Loyalists left the United States during and after the war.[73] Economically mid-Atlantic states recovered particularly quickly and began manufacturing and processing goods, while New England and the South experienced more uneven recoveries.[74] Trade with Britain resumed, and the volume of British imports after the war matched the volume from before the war, though exports fell precipitously.[75] Adams, serving as the ambassador to Britain, called for a retaliatory tariff in order to force the British to negotiate a commercial treaty, particularly regarding access to Caribbean markets. However, Congress lacked the power to regulate foreign commerce or compel the states to follow a unified trade policy, and Britain proved unwilling to negotiate.[76] While trade with the British did not fully recover, the U.S. expanded trade with France, China, the Netherlands, Portugal, and other European countries. Despite these good economic conditions, many traders complained of the high duties imposed by each state, which served to restrain interstate trade. Many creditors also suffered from the failure of domestic governments to repay debts incurred during the war.[77] Though the 1780s saw moderate economic growth, many experienced economic anxiety, and Congress received much of the blame for failing to foster a stronger economy.[78]
