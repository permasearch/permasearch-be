There is some debate as to whether the four concertos were written to accompany four sonnets or vice versa.[1] Though it is not known who wrote the accompanying sonnets, the theory that Vivaldi wrote them is supported by the fact that each sonnet is broken into three sections, each neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Regardless of the sonnets' authorship, The Four Seasons can be classified as program music, instrumental music intended to evoke something extra-musical,[2] and an art form which Vivaldi was determined to prove sophisticated enough to be taken seriously.[3]
