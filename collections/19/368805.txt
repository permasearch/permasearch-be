On 7 October 2015, it was announced that Thomas would be leaving the soap at the end of his contract. In a statement, Thomas explained: "It has been a great privilege to be in Coronation Street for the past 15 years. The cast and crew are amongst the best in the business and to have had the chance to be a part of it for so long has been an amazing experience. The decision to leave was an extremely difficult one but I felt that now was the right time to spread my wings and try other roles. I'm just excited now to see what exit storyline the writers give Jason." Producer Stuart Blackburn said: "Ryan has been an important part of Coronation Street for 15 years. We wish him every success when he moves on next year and we appreciate his desire to try new things."[22] He departed from the show on 29 June 2016.
