Bhakti ideas have inspired many popular texts and saint-poets in India. The Bhagavata Purana, for example, is a Krishna-related text associated with the Bhakti movement in Hinduism.[11] Bhakti is also found in other religions practiced in India,[12][13][14] and it has influenced interactions between Christianity and Hinduism in the modern era.[15][16] Nirguni bhakti (devotion to the divine without attributes) is found in Sikhism, as well as Hinduism.[17][18] Outside India, emotional devotion is found in some Southeast Asian and East Asian Buddhist traditions, and it is sometimes referred to as Bhatti.[19][20][21]
