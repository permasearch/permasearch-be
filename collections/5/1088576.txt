In the UK, usage of the hard shoulder is known as "hard shoulder running". A pilot project on an 11-mile stretch of the M42 motorway, near Birmingham began in September 2006. Special signage, new turnouts (laybys) and a variable speed limit have been put in place to improve safety. This has proved very successful, with journey times decreasing by 26% northbound and 9% southbound. Drivers can also better predict their journey times as the variability decreased by 27%. The average accident rate dropped from 5.2 to 1.5 per month.[11] It has also proved popular with motorists, 60% of whom want to see it expanded to other English motorways. The system has been expanded to the M6,[12] M1[13] and M25,[14], and have now also been implemented to parts of the M60 and M62.[15]
