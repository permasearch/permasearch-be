Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam. The Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate;[81][82] her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian doctrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam.[83][84] Moreover, Hannah's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan (Shayṭān) was said after it had already been born, not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have. The Muslim tradition or hadith, which states that the only children born without the "touch of Satan" were Mary and Jesus,[85] should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran, and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement. The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people, in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [O Satan,] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants, except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee (15:42).[83]
