Shore also uses his themes subtly to inform dramatic connections, rather than serve strictly as a musical stand-in for characters.[note 7] A good example is how Shore forms the first notes of the fellowship theme over Sam joining Frodo, and expanding on it when Merry, Pippin and Strider join the group to hint at the gradual coming together of the Fellowship of the Ring and leading up to the full statement in the council of Elrond. There is even significance as to the order in which themes appear in a scene or to when a theme is absent.
