In March 2015, Lynch expressed doubts about the production due to "complications". Showtime confirmed the series was moving forward, stating: "Nothing is going on that's any more than any preproduction process with David Lynch. Everything is moving forward and everybody is crazy thrilled and excited."[23] In April 2015, Lynch said he would not direct the nine episodes due to budget constraints.[24] He and Showtime came to an agreement, with Lynch confirming on May 15, 2015, that he would direct, and that there would be more episodes than the originally announced nine.[4] At a Twin Peaks panel in Seattle, cast members Sherilyn Fenn and Sheryl Lee said that the new series would consist of 18 episodes and Angelo Badalamenti would return as composer.[25]
