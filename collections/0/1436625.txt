Mr Grossman (Milo Sperber) joined the clothing department after Young Mr Grace suggested having a small section of the men's and lady's department made into an area to sell shoes. Little is known about him as he only appeared in four episodes, although his first episode, in which he was transferred from the Shoe Department, revealed him to be an expert in shoe sales. Mr Grossman was a relaxed and friendly influence in the Men's Department and also spoke with a foreign accent.
