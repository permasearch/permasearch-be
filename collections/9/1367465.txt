Hecate may have originated among the Carians of Anatolia, where variants of her name are found as names given to children. Hecate was also worshipped in the ancient city of Colchis. William Berg observes, "Since children are not called after spooks, it is safe to assume that Carian theophoric names involving hekat- refer to a major deity free from the dark and unsavoury ties to the underworld and to witchcraft associated with the Hecate of classical Athens."[17] In particular, there is some evidence that she might be derived from the local sun goddesses (see also Arinna), based on similar attributes.[18] She also closely parallels the Roman goddess Trivia, with whom she was identified in Rome.
