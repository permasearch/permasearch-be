During PhaseÂ I, most allowances in all countries were given freely (known as grandfathering). This approach has been criticized[21] as giving rise to windfall profits, being less efficient than auctioning, and providing too little incentive for innovative new competition to provide clean, renewable energy.[22][23] On the other hand, allocation rather than auctioning may be justified for a few sectors that face international competition like the aluminium and steel industries.[24][25]
