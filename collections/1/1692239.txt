Belarus was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).[123] Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials),[124] including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.[125] Travel bans imposed by the European Union have been lifted in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue.[126]
