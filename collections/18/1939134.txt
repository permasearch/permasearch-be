In aggressive behaviour by male stalk-eyed flies the males "square off" by displaying their eyes.[4] Females show a strong preference for mating with males with longer eyestalks. Due to the female preference, males have evolved to compete with each other for mating rights. In the threat display the two flies face each other head-to-head, with their forelegs spread outward and parallel to the eyestalks.[5] This behaviour allows each individual to judge the distance between its competitor's eyes. Eyestalk length increases with body size, and males with shorter eyestalks will usually retreat.[5] A further distance between the eyes conveys a bigger body size, and a better chance of winning.[5]
