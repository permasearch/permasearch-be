The black and white video featured a 20-year-old Marky Mark working out and boxing barechested, and making out with a girl on a bed. Boxer Micky Ward is credited for helping with the boxing technique and training used for this video. Mark Wahlberg first met Micky Ward when he was 18 and later played him on the big screen in the 2010 film The Fighter. The music video was produced by David Horgan and directed by Scott Kalvert.
