In the Research Excellence Framework (REF), published on 18 December 2014, it was confirmed that Royal Holloway sits within the top 25 per cent of UK universities for 'world-leading' and 'internationally excellent' research. In the REF assessment, 81 per cent of Royal Holloway's research is rated as world-leading (4*) and internationally excellent (3*), which is an increase of over 20 per cent from RAE 2008, which is the last time an exercise on this scale was conducted.[citation needed]
