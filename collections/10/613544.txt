Marisol (Tonantzin Esparza) begins as an ex-gang member participating in one of Angie's gang rehab projects, which happens to be teaching dog grooming. Marisol laments that she doesn't want to be a dog groomer and envision herself with a classier job, such as working in an office, to which Angie responds by encouraging George to hire her at Powers Brothers for a trial period. She is known for having an attitude problem and for being very rude to people. When George was talking to Angie he says,"You remember the guy we fired that came back and tried to shoot up the place? He had a better attitude!" Her most famous line is, "I know, huh?" and "Ay, What are you looking at?" She has told Ernie directly on the first encounter that he has big ears, told George that he has a big head, and she answered the office telephone "Hello, Powers Brothers Aviation. How can I help your ass?" when Max's school called. She also took personal calls at work. Benny likes the way Marisol treats people ("She's like you, mom, but with estrogen."). She got George in trouble with the Powers Brothers for not responding to important calls. She took Carmen to a club past midnight and got her grounded, although she had good intentions and was only helping Carmen stand up to mean kids who were teasing her just like in her old school.  After taking Carmen out to a club, she is kicked out and ends up with Benny.  At first, she and Benny do not seem to get along, but then they realize that they have so much in common.  She was last seen cleaning up in Benny's house.
