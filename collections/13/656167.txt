In the 1810s, Mexico was under Spanish control and known as New Spain. The independence movement began to take shape when Jose Bernardo Gutierrez de Lara went to the small town of Dolores (now known as Dolores Hidalgo) and asked the local Roman Catholic priest, Miguel Hidalgo, to help initiate an effort to free New Spain from Spanish control.
