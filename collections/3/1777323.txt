Within countries there can be important differences in turnout between individual elections .[29] Elections where control of the national executive is not at stake generally have much lower turnoutsâ€”often half that for general elections.[citation needed] Municipal and provincial elections, and by-elections to fill casual vacancies, typically have lower turnouts, as do elections for the parliament of the supranational European Union, which is separate from the executive branch of the EU's government. In the United States, midterm congressional elections attract far lower turnouts than Congressional elections held concurrently with Presidential ones.[30] Runoff elections also tend to attract lower turnouts.
