Compared with lions, a weight range of 150 to 189 kg (331 to 417 lb) is considered fairly average for a male East African lion in the Serengeti.[137][138] Weights of 190 to 225 kg (419 to 496 lb) are typical for male lions in Southern Africa.[139] Southern African lions appear to be the largest wild lions, on average.[140][141] Apart from the above-mentioned uses of the Bengal tiger in culture, the fight between a tiger and a lion has, for a long time, been a popular topic of discussion by hunters, naturalists, artists, and poets, and continue to inspire the popular imagination in the present day.[142][143][144] Some are of the opinion that the Bengal tiger would emerge victorious in a fight against the lion.[145][146][147][148][149]
