Around 1300â€“1350 the Medieval Warm Period gave way to the Little Ice Age.[68] The colder climate resulted in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317.[69] The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death.[70] Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent.[71] By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to perhaps no more than a third of what it was a century earlier.[72] The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War.[73]
