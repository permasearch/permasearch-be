"Bass Down Low" is the debut single by American recording artist Dev, written and performed by Dev and The Cataracs. Produced by The Cataracs, the song was released on November 16, 2010, through Universal Republic as the lead single for Dev's debut studio album, The Night the Sun Came Up (2011). Initially, the song was made for The Cataracs with Dev as the featured act, but she was made the main artist as they believed it would be a suitable follow-up to Far East Movement's "Like a G6", which Dev and The Cataracs appeared on. British rapper Tinie Tempah was featured on an official remix of "Bass Down Low" that was made for the song's release in the United Kingdom. Musically, "Bass Down Low" is an electro song with skittering synths and the lyrics speak of different forms of debauchery.
