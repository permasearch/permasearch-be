Automatic or switchblade knives are generally prohibited, with certain exceptions based on blade length and number of sharpened edges. Switchblades and automatic knives with telescoping blade opening designs are prohibited. Side-opening automatic knives are also prohibited unless 1) the blade is no longer than 8.5Â cm, and 2) the blade is single-edged, i.e. a blade without double edges, such as a stiletto or dagger.[citation needed]
