Refracting telescopes first appeared in the Netherlands in 1608, apparently the product of spectacle makers experimenting with lenses (Inventor is unknown but Hans Lippershey applied for the first patent, followed by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar).[107] Galileo was one of the first scientists to use this new tool for his astronomical observations in 1609.[108]
