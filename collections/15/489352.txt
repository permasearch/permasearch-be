Meanwhile when Abhi and Tanu are about to take rounds, Tanu slips and her dupatta removes. Dadi, Dasi and Purab realise that it isn't Pragya who is marrying Abhi and gets worried having no way to stop the wedding. Pragya cries at her kidnapped location thinking her husband is marrying another woman and she can't do anything but fortunately, Sarla makes it on time to the Mehra house exactly when Abhi and Tanu are going for their last round, to announce her daughter's kidnapping. Abhi leaves with Purab immediately to rescue Pragya without completely the last round infuriating Tanu who ask Nikhil to kill Pragya but Pragya manages to escape from the goons.
