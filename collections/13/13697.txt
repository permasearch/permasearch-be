Zarra encourages Bay to join her on her hunt for an artist named "Smak" who ruins other people's street art by marking his name on the pieces. Eventually this lands her in jail. Zarra asks Bay to post a $1,500 bail without telling her that her friend was also jailed for the same reason, driving Bay to steal it from John's safe at the carwash. Zarra and Bay and some friends of Zarra's were caught by the police while doing street art in an alleyway. They were let go due to Bay's Dad being John Kennish, the former baseball player.
