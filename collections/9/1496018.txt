A colony can grow exceptionally fast. Colonies that housed 15â€“20 workers in May grew to over 7,000 by September. These colonies started to produce reproductive ants when they were a year old, and by the time they were two years old, they had over 25,000 workers. The population doubled to 50,000 when these colonies were three years old.[249] At maturity, a colony can house 100,000 to 250,000 individuals, but other reports suggest that colonies can hold more than 400,000.[d][250][251][252][253] Polygyne colonies have the potential to grow much larger than monogyne colonies.[251]
