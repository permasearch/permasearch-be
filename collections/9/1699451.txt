Traditional naturopathy varies from naturopathic medicine both in philosophy, principles and scope of practice. Traditional naturopathy is considered wholistic health approach that focuses on natural lifestyle and living in accordance with natural laws ordained by the creator. [10] The body is governed by definite natural laws and all disease is a result of departing from those natural laws. The level of disease is a product of ones departure form those the natural physical, chemical, biological and psychological laws governing the body. This being the case, when one brings themselves into harmony with nature the body comes into it's own to heal itself.[11] Although there are several organizations the majority of traditional naturopaths in the US are represented by two National Organizations. The American Naturopathic Association founded in 1909 by Dr. Benedict Lust with 5,000 members [12] and the American Naturopathic Medical Association founded in 1981 claiming about 4000 members [13] With a little under 2000 Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine licensed throughout the United States Registered or Certified traditional naturopaths comprise about 82% of the profession.
