Saudi women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, such as the justice system. Although they make up 70% of those enrolled in universities, for social reasons, women make up 5% of the workforce in Saudi Arabia,[30] the lowest proportion in the world. The treatment of women has been referred to as "sex segregation"[31][32] and "gender apartheid".[33][34] Implementation of a government resolution supporting expanded employment opportunities for women met resistance from within the labor ministry,[35] from the religious police,[36] and from the male citizenry.[37]
