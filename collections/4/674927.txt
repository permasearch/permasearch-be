Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into social norms, which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods.[28] This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society.[27] In the post-industrial city, concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector,[23] the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control.[25] These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.[24]
