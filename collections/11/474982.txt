Ultimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater.[17] Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies.
