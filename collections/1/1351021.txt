In 1937, John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties.[22] Being larger than but similar in nature to human neurons, squid cells were easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the giant squid axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential.
