The average distance from Kepler-22b to its host star Kepler-22 is about 15% less than the distance from Earth to the Sun[3] but the luminosity (light output) of Kepler-22 is about 25% less than that of the Sun.[9] This combination of a shorter average distance from the star and a lower stellar luminosity are consistent with a moderate surface temperature at that distance, if it is assumed that the surface is not subject to extreme greenhouse heating.
