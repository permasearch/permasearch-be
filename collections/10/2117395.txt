In 2011, the Oxford English Dictionary removed the word "cassette player" from its 12th edition Concise version.[45] Some media sources mistakenly claimed that the word "cassette tape" was being removed and this caused some media backlash.[46] The term was removed to help make room for more than 400 new words being added to the dictionary.[47]
