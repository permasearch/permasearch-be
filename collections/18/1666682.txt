Insalul Ahmed of Complex placed the song at number two on their best of the year list, reporting that "most artists might have avoided making a song like this after something like Swiftgate. But that’s why we love [Kan]Ye: He doesn’t give a fuck."[38] New York Post also named the song as the best of the year, musing "whether he’s self-deprecating or pulling the wool over our eyes, we can’t help running toward this talented bad boy when he tells us, 'Run away from me, baby'... Maybe it’s not his Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, but ours.[39] Rap Up listed the song as the fifth best of the year.[40] In January 2011, The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked "Runaway" at number four to find the best music of 2010; West's other singles "Power" and "Monster" were ranked at numbers five and six, respectively, on the same poll (their parent album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was ranked as the best album on the poll as well).
