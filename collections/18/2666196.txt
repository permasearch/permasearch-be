Some stations also listed the types of emergencies that the EBS would be activated for (i.e., tornado warning, flash flood warning, hurricane warning, or earthquake); at least one version of the announcement made explicit reference to an attack on the United States as being a possible scenario for EBS activation. In the late 1980s, several television stations in the Los Angeles area had specific test scripts that emphasized earthquake preparedness.
