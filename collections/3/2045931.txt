A reversed forecast (RF) is a wager requiring the naming of two selections to finish 1st and 2nd in either order in a specified event.[1] It is the same as two straight forecasts on selections a and b: a 1st, b 2nd and b 1st, a 2nd. Requires two unit stakes. Equivalent to a "boxed" exacta/perfecta in North America, where the quinella is a similar wager that requires only one unit stake.
