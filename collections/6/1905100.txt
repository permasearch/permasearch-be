Inquisitors are controlled by The Papal States and are sent to a faction's lands if they have fallen out of favour with the Pope. They can accuse any agent, general, or even a faction's King of heresy, and if they are found guilty, they will be executed. To get rid of Inquisitors, a faction can gain favour with the Pope by building churches, converting the population, and avoiding hostile actions against any of the more favourable Catholic factions. Factions can also attempt to assassinate Inquisitors.
