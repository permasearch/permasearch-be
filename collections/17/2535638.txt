Knight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings: hitting with dumbbells, punching, and slamming her against walls. Starvation was also included.[32][75] Knight's grandmother told reporters that Knight would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings she endured; Knight also lost hearing in one ear.[76] At one point, Knight had a pet dog while in captivity, but Castro killed the dog by snapping its neck after it bit Castro while trying to protect Knight.[77] DeJesus told law enforcement she was raped but did not believe she was ever impregnated.[75]
