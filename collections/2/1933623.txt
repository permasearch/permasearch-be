There have been many notable analysts other than Tovey and Keller. One of the best known and most influential was Heinrich Schenker, who developed Schenkerian analysis, a method that seeks to describe all tonal classical works as elaborations ("prolongations") of a simple contrapuntal sequence. Ernst Kurth coined the term of "developmental motif"[citation needed]. Rudolph RÃ©ti is notable for tracing the development of small melodic motifs through a work,[citation needed] while Nicolas Ruwet's analysis amounts to a kind of musical semiology.[citation needed]
