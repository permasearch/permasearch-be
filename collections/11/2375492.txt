Women have served in the Pakistan Army since its foundation. Currently, there is a sizeable number of women serving in the Pakistan Army. Most women are recruited in the Army to perform medical and educational work. There is also a Women's Guard section of Pakistan's National Guard where women are trained in nursing, welfare and clerical work and there are also women recruited in very limited numbers for the Janbaz Force. Only recently has Pakistan began to recruit women for Elite Anti-Terrorist Police Force in 2007, several female graduates were nominated to be Sky Marshals for Pakistan-based airlines.[85] In addition recently eight of the 41 cadets from the Pakistan Military Academy at Kakul became the first women guards of honour.[86] Pakistan is the only country in the Islamic world to have female Major Generals in the Army.[87] Major General Shahida Malik, an Army doctor was Pakistan's first female two-star general.[88]
