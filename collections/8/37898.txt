Their most recent appearance was in The Ugly Truth, when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was deviled eggs, which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.
