Also Einstein (following Hendrik Lorentz and Max Abraham) used velocity- and direction-dependent mass concepts (longitudinal and transverse mass) in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906.[44][45] However, in his first paper on E = mc2 (1905), he treated m as what would now be called the rest mass.[3] Some claim that (in later years) he did not like the idea of "relativistic mass".[46]Â  When modern physicists say "mass", they are usually talking about rest mass, since if they meant "relativistic mass", they would just say "energy".
