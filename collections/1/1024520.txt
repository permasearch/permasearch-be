In the summer of 1916, Maslov was shot down and badly wounded during a dogfight with the Germans, losing his sight in both eyes, which led Zelle to ask for permission to visit her wounded lover at the hospital where he was staying near the front.[14] As a citizen of a neutral country, Zelle would not normally be allowed near the front. Zelle was met by agents from the Deuxi√®me Bureau who told her that she would only be allowed to see Maslov if she agreed to spy on Germany.[14]
