Bramall Lane was regularly used for international matches before the construction of a national stadium in London. The world's first ever floodlit football match took place at Bramall Lane on 14 October 1878 in front of an attendance of 20,000.[17] England's match against Scotland on 10 March 1883 was the first match between these two countries outside London or Glasgow. It makes it the oldest football venue still capable of hosting international matches in the world.
