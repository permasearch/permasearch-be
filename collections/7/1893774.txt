Festina lente or speûde bradéōs (σπεῦδε βραδέως) is a classical adage and oxymoron meaning "make haste slowly" (sometimes rendered in English as "more haste, less speed"[1]).  It has been adopted as a motto numerous times, particularly by the emperors Augustus and Titus, the Medicis and the Onslows.
