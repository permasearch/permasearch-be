The Daily Prophet is the most widely read daily newspaper in Britain's wizard community.[20] The articles include moving pictures.[21][22] Its journalistic integrity is lacking; it has been known to be more concerned about sales than about factual accuracy and is often a mouthpiece for the Ministry of Magic; as described by Rita Skeeter, "The Prophet exists to sell itself!"[23]
