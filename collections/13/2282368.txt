Prior to the game, funding from MLB and commonwealth grants given to the City of Williamsport provided more than four million dollars to improve BB&T Ballpark. These included adding new seats, padding around the infield fence, new irrigation and draining to the field itself, moving the bullpens out beyond the outfield fence, new dugouts closer to home plate, and improved dining areas.[10]
