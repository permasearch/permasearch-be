Under DOS, the file is executed by the primary copy of the command-line processor (typically COMMAND.COM) once the operating system has booted and the CONFIG.SYS file processing has finished. While DOS by itself provides no means to pass batch file parameters to COMMAND.COM for AUTOEXEC.BAT processing, the alternative command-line processor 4DOS supports a 4DOS.INI AutoExecParams directive and //AutoExecParams= startup option to define such parameters.[4] Under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, three initial parameters will be passed to either the corresponding STARTxxy.BAT (if it exists) or the generic AUTOEXEC.BAT startup file, %1 holds the virtual console number,[5] %2 the 2-digit terminal number (xx) (with 00 being the main console) and %3 the 1-digit session number (y).[6]
