The Express Pass, introduced in the previous series, returned, allowing the team that places first in the first leg to skip any later task in the race. The last team to complete the first task was forced to complete a U-Turn in the next leg, performing both tasks of the leg's Detour.[4] A new game mechanic was also introduced in this season: legs without a mandatory rest period between them. At the end of the first leg in Sydney, Australia, and the fourth leg in Lijiang, China, teams were told their placements. They were then ordered to keep racing with a new Route Info clue; the first team to check in was still awarded a prize and the last team to check in was not eliminated and did not have to perform a Speed Bump in the next leg.
