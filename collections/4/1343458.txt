3. When dark clouds enshroud the hills And gray mist the valley fills, Yet Thou art not hidden from Thy sons. Pierce the gloom in which we cower With Thy sunshine's cleansing power Then we'll feel and understand Then we'll feel and understand That God dwelleth in this land. That God dwelleth in this land.
