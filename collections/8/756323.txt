In 1815, Brazil was elevated to the rank of kingdom, and the kingdoms of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves were united as a single state--the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The Charter Act of 1816 established the insignia of the new kingdom.[4] It specified that the arms of the Kingdom of Brazil was to be composed of a gold armillary sphere on a blue field.[4] During this time, the flag of Brazil was the flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves.
