The RAF is a juristic person established by an Act of Parliament, namely, the Road Accident Fund Act, 1996 (Act No. 56 of 1996), as amended (”RAF Act”). It commenced operations on 1 May 1997, assuming at the time, all the rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund. The RAF is responsible for providing compulsory social insurance cover to all users of South African roads; to rehabilitate and compensate persons injured as a result of the negligent driving of motor vehicles in a timely and caring manner; and to actively promote the safe use of all South African roads. Section 3 of the RAF Act stipulates that "the object of the Fund shall be the payment of compensation in accordance with this Act for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of a motor vehicle". The customer base of the RAF, therefore, comprises not only the South African public, but all foreigners within the borders of the country. The RAF provides two types of cover, namely personal insurance cover to accident victims or their families, and indemnity cover to wrongdoers.
