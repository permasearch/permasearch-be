Although normally known for his slow but focussed repose with the bat, the first Test against New Zealand gave Cook a chance making three sharp catches in the first innings[123] and mirroring his efforts with three even more spectacular catches in the second innings, the first two off Ryan Sidebottom who then went on to make a hat-trick with a final LBW,[124] the match itself saw England collapse in the second innings for 110 with Cook being the only other player besides Ian Bell to make it into double figures.[125] Incidentally, Cook's other catch in the second innings was also off Sidebottom to dismiss New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori, a feat the pair reproduced in the second innings of the second Test[126] and again in the first innings of the third Test.[127] His batting meanwhile began its long road of decline scoring no more than sixty in the two Tests and falling for only two runs in the final match,[127] though in the second Test he did secure another English record being the youngest Englishman at just over 23 years, to score 2,000 Test runs â€“ again eclipsing Gower;[128] two days later he recorded his first Test six after 2047 runs, including 233 boundaries, after an accidental top edge and ruined his chances of beating Vijay Manjrekar's 2,308 record.[129]
