2014 saw the first continent-wide "green year", a big year executed with a minimum of environmental impact. In his rather extreme instance, Dorian Anderson bicycled 17,830 miles around the United States, amassing a self-powered, petroleum-free 617 species during his 365 days on America's roads. If Red-legged Honeycreeper, a would-be first for North American, is accepted by the ABA, he will add one additional bird to reach 618 species. Dorian visited 28 states (some twice) during his adventure and, beyond his species total, raised $49,000 for habitat conservation. He shunned all motorized transportation for the entire adventure, refusing even ferries that would have saved him sometimes hundreds of miles of riding around various bodies of water. Once hit by a car and many times nearly missed, it was a minor miracle that he survived the entire year without major injury.[23]
