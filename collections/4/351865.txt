EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino & John Curly (the E, M & C in EMC),[15] introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981[16][17] and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.[18]
