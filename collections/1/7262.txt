Teams RWBY and JNPR spend time in the library. Jaune flirts with Weiss, but is rebuffed. Sun introduces Neptune, whose flirty approach seems more to Weiss' liking. Blake acts inattentive and leaves the room. A flashback shows her in a discussion with Ozpin after the incident at the docks, during which she states that she conceals her Faunus identity because she doesn't want the attention and discrimination other Faunus get. In the present, Weiss reminds Blake of her promise to share her problems with her team. Blake admits that she fears that they are not ready to stop their enemies. Ruby announces that they will bring the bad guys down, and the team starts to make a plan.
