The G20 was a badge-engineered version of the Nissan Primera, but because Infiniti was pitched as a premium brand, it featured a high level of equipment compared to its European and Japanese relatives. The only engine available was the 2.0Â litre SR20DE Inline 4-cylinder; in Europe this was the top-of-the-line engine for the Primera lineup. 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions were both available, with the 5-speed being praised as "one of the best in the business."[4] Power windows, power locks, power mirrors, air conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, alloy wheels, a Bose stereo, a theft-deterrent system, cruise control, floor mats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob were all standard. Heated mirrors, leather seats and a power moonroof were common options, and were later offered in a package that included power seats and keyless entry. Later models also featured dual front airbags. The standard trim was called Luxury. Two major trim package upgrades were offered: Touring, badged G20t, available from model years 1994 to 1996 and 1999 to 2001, and Sport (with no badge modification) which was offered during model year 2002. These packages featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission, sportier, more highly bolstered front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, all-black leather interior, fog lamps, and a spoiler on the rear decklid. The details of these trims varied from year to year.
