In an interview with IGN, Kirkman stated that the third season will bring the video game closer to the comic book's current time frame at the time of its planned release. This season will take place a few years after the second season, and will include a somewhat older Clementine along with AJ, the infant she rescues at the end of Season 2 and now a toddler.[32][33][34] Clementine will be a playable character along with a new character, Javier.[35] Telltale is working to adapt its previous data about player choices from the first two seasons, which were saved locally to a player's computer or console, to work with their new cloud-based saving approach, so that these previous choices will affect how the story in the third season will play out. Telltale is expected to provide more details around the 2016 Comic-Con.[36] The game will use the updated Telltale game engine that it is using for its Batman game.
