It all began in the year 1948, when Malayan Communist Party murdered 3 European farmers at Sungai Siput, Perak and also murdered the 3 leaders of Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party).Sir Edward Gent declared an emergency on 7 July 1948 in all Malaya Federations, starting with Perak on 16 June 1948 and Johore on 19 June 1948. To deal with rebellion and to hunt down the Communist terrorists in the jungle, a military based team was formed in 1948 and it was named the Flying Squad and later renamed as Jungle Squad, with their main mission to fight against the Communists. The first Jungle Squad unit was established at Sik, Kedah in 1949. Training centres were opened in Sungai Buluh, Selangor and in Dusun Tua, Hulu Langat, Selangor which was known as Field Force Special Training Centre (SLPPH). In 1964, SLPPH was transferred to Kroh, Perak then changed to Kentonmen, Ulu Kinta, Perak. After being renamed the General Operations Force or Pasukan Gerakan Am in 1997, SLPPH is now known as Sekolah Latihan Pasukan Gerakan Am (General Operations Force Training Centre, SLPGA).
