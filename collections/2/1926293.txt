In a tape of her police interrogation, she describes herself as a housewife who earns a little money on the side "selling clothes and renting houses." When asked why she had been arrested, she responded, "Because of an extradition order to the United States."[13] Her life behind bars at the Santa Martha Acatitla womenâ€™s prison in Mexico City has apparently not been to her liking as she filed a complaint with a Mexico City human rights commission,[14] saying her cell had insects, which she referred to as noxious fauna. She also said the ban on bringing in food from restaurants violated her human rights.
