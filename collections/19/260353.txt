As You Like It was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 4 August 1600 as a work which was "to be stayed," i.e., not published till the Stationers' Company were satisfied that the publisher in whose name the work was entered was the undisputed owner of the copyright. Thomas Morley's First Book of Ayres, published in London in 1600 contains a musical setting for the song "It was a Lover and his Lass" from As You Like It. This evidence implies that the play was in existence in some shape or other before 1600.
