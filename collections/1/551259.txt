Prayer was an essential part of Hawaiian life, employed when building a house, making a canoe, and giving lomilomi massage.  Hawaiians addressed prayers to various gods depending on the situation.  When healers picked herbs for medicine, they usually prayed to Kū and Hina, male and female, right and left, upright and supine. The people worshiped Lono during Makahiki season and Kū during times of war.[citation needed]
