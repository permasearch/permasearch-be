where     D   {\displaystyle D}   is the duty cycle,     P W   {\displaystyle PW}   is the pulse width (pulse active time), and     T   {\displaystyle T}   is the total period of the signal. Thus, a 60% duty cycle means the signal is on 60% of the time but off 40% of the time. The "on time" for a 60% duty cycle could be a fraction of a second, a day, or even a week, depending on the length of the period.
