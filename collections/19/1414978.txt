The idea of a casino modeled after the New York skyline was conceived by Sig Rogich (a former White House staffer and United States Ambassador to Iceland) and Mark Advent.[5] Rogich brought the idea to his friend, Gary Primm, head of Primadonna Resorts.[5] Primm approached MGM president Bob Maxey in 1994 with the idea for MGM's prime Strip location, and a joint venture was formed between the two companies.[6] Construction began in March 1995.[7]
