Odie is a yellow beagle, also owned by Jon. He was initially owned by Jon's roommate, Lyman (see below), but later became Jon's dog. Odie is often punted or pushed off the table by Garfield though Odie sometimes gets him back. He is almost always shown to be dumb, but there are several strips in which he seems to be smart and clever..
