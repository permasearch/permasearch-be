In his civilian identity he is attacked by an assassin named Saiko who insists that he is the fiercest killer in Gotham.[12] The series Batman Incorporated relaunches with a second volume, continuing its story while taking into account the New 52's continuity changes; Dick is now depicted as Nightwing, and not as Batman, but the change is not addressed in the comic itself. In Nightwing, Dick inherits the deed to the circus from a dying C. C. Haly and begins a relationship with his childhood friend acrobat Raya Vestri. Saiko tortures Haly for information on Nightwing's secret identity, and the old man dies in Dick's arms after telling him the circus holds a terrible secret.[13] Investigating leads, he tracks down a supervillain named Feedback, who used to be a childhood friend, but does not learn anything.[14] Following Haly's clues, he finds a mysterious Book of Names in the circus that has his name on the last page.[15] Later the circus announces they will be doing a memorial show on the anniversary of the night Dick's parents were murdered, and Saiko attacks by detonating a massive explosion.[16]
