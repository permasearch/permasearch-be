Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias.[28] Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.[29] Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.[28] Unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented.[29] To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.[30] According to Huff, "The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism."[31]
