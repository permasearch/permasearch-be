The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 street car marked the N1 engine's introduction to the consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 street cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The camshaft timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400rpm faster than R33 N1.
