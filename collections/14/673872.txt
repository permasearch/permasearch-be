The Office of the Attorney General was created by the 1st United States Congress by the Judiciary Act of 1789.[2] In 1792, the Congress made the Attorney General a Cabinet-level post.[2] In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the bill creating the Department of Justice.[2] Still, there was not yet a permanent home for either the Attorney General or the Justice Department, and each had occupied a succession of temporary spaces in federal government buildings and privately owned office buildings.[2] While plans to provide the Department with its own building were developed as early as 1910, it was not until the late 1920s that significant progress was made toward this goal.[2]
