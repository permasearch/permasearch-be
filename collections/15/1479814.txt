The cell phones the teams received by Craig at the previous elimination ceremony rang with the message that they must choose different captains. Chance insists on being the captain for the Green team, while the Gold team unanimously selects Rodeo. Destiney witnesses the Green team poorly strategizing, and asks if she can step up as captain, and then they make her the captain instead of Chance. The challenge was a reference to the event on Flavor of Love 2, when H-Town and Saaphyri were involved in a fist fight over a bed. The bed was to be suspended over water, and when someone steps over a certain line, one half of the bed drops. The object was to use giant sticks to knock the opponent off the bed. If a contestant grabs onto the cables, or their flower stick gets knocked into the water, the contestant will be disqualified and the opposing contestant gets a point. The team that received the most points out of five rounds would be crowned the winning team. Whiteboy and 12 Pack battle, and Whiteboy wins after 12 Pack is disqualified for grabbing onto a cable, giving the Green Team the first point. The Entertainer and Heat are up next, where The Entertainer knocks Heat's stick out of his hands which results in a disqualification. The Gold team therefore ties with the Green team. Real and Hoopz battle next, and Hoopz ends up victorious although Real states it was because he did not want to harm a girl and he realizes he has feelings for Hoopz. Rodeo and Chance were next to compete, and Rodeo got her head stuck in the wires, literally choking her, and instead of continuing to beat her, Chance freed Rodeo. Chance still receives the point for his team and the Green team was a point away from winning. The next two were chosen as Mr. Boston and Nibblz. Mr. Boston won the match, much to the dismay of Nibblz and her team, giving the Green team the win.
