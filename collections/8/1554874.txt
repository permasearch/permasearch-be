RR Lyraes have proven difficult to observe in external galaxies because of their intrinsic faintness. (In fact, Walter Baade's failure to find them in the Andromeda galaxy led him to suspect that the galaxy was much farther away than predicted, to reconsider the calibration of Cepheid variables, and to propose the concept of stellar populations.[1]) Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in the 1980s, Pritchet & van den Bergh found RR Lyraes in Andromeda's galactic halo[2] and, more recently, in its globular clusters.[3]
