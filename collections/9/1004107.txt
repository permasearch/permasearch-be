To help promote the song and album, Yankovic directed a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented as if they are one-act plays to an audience. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento and Judy Tenuta.
