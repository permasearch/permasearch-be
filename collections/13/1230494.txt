Due to the success of the mixtape,[63] Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as "one of the biggest bidding wars ever".[64] Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009.[65] This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.[66]
