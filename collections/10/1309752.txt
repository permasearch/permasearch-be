In 1985 a distinctive method of exploration was invented. In a dome area 255 feet (78Â m) above the Big Room floor not far from the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite leaned out. Using a balsa wood loop with helium-filled balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a climbing rope into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World.[19] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.
