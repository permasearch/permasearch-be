United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia cited My Cousin Vinny as an example of the principle that a client can choose his own lawyer,[11] but United States Senator John Kennedy told nominee Matthew S. Petersen that having seen the film did not qualify one to be a federal judge.[12] The authors of Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the Movies (2006) gave the film its highest rating along with several films based on real trials, such as Judgment at Nuremberg and Breaker Morant.[13] In 2008 the ABA Journal ranked the film #3 on its list of the "25 Greatest Legal Movies",[4] and in 2010 ranked Pesci's character as #12 on its list of "The 25 Greatest Fictional Lawyers (Who Are Not Atticus Finch)".[14]
