A regular polygon with n sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if     n =  2  r    3  s    p  1    p  2   ⋯  p  k   ,   {\displaystyle n=2^{r}3^{s}p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{k},}   where r, s, k ≥ 0 and where the pi are distinct Pierpont primes greater than 3 (primes of the form      2  t    3  u   + 1 ) .   {\displaystyle 2^{t}3^{u}+1).}  [7]:Thm. 2
