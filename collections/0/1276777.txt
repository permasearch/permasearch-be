The River Lea was a smaller boundary than the Thames, but it was a significant one. The building of the Royal Docks consisting of the Royal Victoria Dock (1855), able to berth vessels of up to 8000 tons;[35] Royal Albert Dock (1880), up to 12,000 tons;[36] and King George V Dock (1921), up to 30,000 tons,[37] on the estuary marshes, extended the continuous development of London across the Lea into Essex for the first time.[38] The railways gave access to a passenger terminal at Gallions Reach and new suburbs created in West Ham, which quickly became a major manufacturing town, with 30,000 houses built between 1871 and 1901.[39] Soon afterwards, East Ham was built up to serve the new Gas Light and Coke Company and Bazalgette's grand sewage works at Beckton.[40]
