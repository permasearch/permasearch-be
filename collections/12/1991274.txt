My reason for reinstating: There were clear parallels in the interpretation of the meaning of the protections in both laws which were quite similar. One kept the King at bay from arms regulation and the other kept the Federal government at bay. The recent Heller and Chicago decisions took a fundamentally different interpretation than all previous decisions and it was thus revisionist. This text explains how the law in the USA has diverged markedly in terms of legal principals in the Heller and MacDonald decisions. This is a fundamentally important divergence and needs to be in the English Law section. (It is after all where the laws diverge from each other).
