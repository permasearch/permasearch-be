Later on, the film's second official trailer, which also featured a new version of the original Japanese opening theme, "Mesaze Pokémon Master", was previewed on April 7, 2017. The next day, the producers announced that the current last Pokémon in the Pokédex, Marshadow, would debut in the film alongside several other brand-new characters.[12] As the film is not a direct remake, it diverts itself from the original season that it is based on, and features an original story.[13] Two days before the film's release, Yoshitoshi Shinomiya, who draw background art for Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works released a new poster for the film.[14]
