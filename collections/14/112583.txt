"The movement of 116, like its tone, is careful, controlled, laborious…it defines and redefines its subject in each quatrain, and this subject becomes increasingly vulnerable".[2] It starts out as motionless and distant, remote, independent—then moves to be "less remote, more tangible and earthbound",[2] and the final couplet brings a sense of "coming back down to earth". Ideal love is deteriorating throughout the sonnet and continues to do so through the couplet.
