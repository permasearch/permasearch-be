In Saudi Arabia, New Year's is solely celebrated in private gatherings. As the Islamic calendar is the official civic calendar, the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Viceâ€”Saudi Arabia's religious police, has enforced a ban on public festivities of the Gregorian New Year. The organization can also fine shops for offering New Year's-related products, and confiscate them. However, the organization does not go after individual citizens holding private celebrations.[77][78]
