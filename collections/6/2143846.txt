In the Priestly Code, the regulations concerning the cities of refuge state that, once he had claimed asylum, a perpetrator had to be taken from the city and put on trial;[5] if the trial found that the perpetrator was innocent of murder, then the perpetrator had to be returned under guard (for their own protection) to the city in which they had claimed asylum.[6] This law code treats blood money as an unacceptable device that would compound the crime, insisting that atonement can only be made by blood.[7]
