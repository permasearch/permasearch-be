Although the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor was not sold to the general public, they are widely available via secondhand in North America once they are decommissioned and no longer in service in law enforcement and fleet duty. The cars are in demand by taxi companies, those who want a safe, durable and/or inexpensive car, and those who need a car with a bench seat which can take three passengers in the back. The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor came equipped with many heavy duty parts such as a revised transmission, and a 187 kW (254 PS; 251 hp) engine. Used Crown Victoria Police Interceptors are normally stripped of any police decals, computer equipment, police radios, and emergency lights before being sold or auctioned to the public.[2]
