Human Rights Watch reported that main bases used by Azerbaijani armed forces for the bombardment of Stepanakert were the towns of Khojaly and Shusha.[121] In February 1992, Khojaly was captured by a mixed force of ethnic Armenians and, according to international observers, the 366th Commonwealth of Independent States regiment.[122] After its capture, Khojaly became the site of the largest massacre to occur during the Nagorno-Karabakh war.[123] Human rights Watch estimates that at least 161 Azerbaijani civilians, as well as a number of unarmed hors de combat, were killed as they fled the town.[121] The siege was finally lifted a few months later, in May 1992, when Armenian forces scored a decisive victory by capturing Shusha.[124]
