Android fat distributions change across life course. The main changes in women are associated with menopause. Premenopausal women tend to show a more gynoid fat distribution than post-menopausal women - this is associated with a drop in oestrogen levels. An android fat distribution becomes more common post-menopause, where oestrogen is at its lowest levels.[10][42] Older men show android fat distributions more often than younger men [43] which may be due to lifestyle changes, or hormonal changes related to age.[44] Older adults have a greater waist-to-hip ratio than young adults which indicates high levels of android fat in older adults. Computed tomography studies show that older adults have a two-fold increase in visceral fat compared to young adults.These changes in android fat distribution in older adults occurs in the absence of any clinical diseases.[45]
