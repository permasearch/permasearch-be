Faison retired from drug dealing, and adopted a mission to steer youth away from the path he once chose. In 1989, he formed a rap group called MobStyle and released a solo album in 1991. Following the murders of his drug-dealing childhood friend Rich Porter and his little brother Donnell Porter in 1990, Faison began working on a movie about his life which eventually became Paid in Full, which came out in 2002. The Faison character was portrayed by Wood Harris.
