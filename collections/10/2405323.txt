Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com noted, "There are songs like 'Tu Hi Junoon', 'Malang' and 'Kamli' that round off Dhoom 3 beautifully." Koimoi reported, "Overall it might not be the best album Pritam has come up with, but two really interesting compositions makes the album scrupulous me! A noteworthy effort for sure!"[131] The predictions turned out to be true as the album topped the iTunes charts only after the release of the film. The songs "Kamli" and "Dhoom Machale" topped the iTunes singles chart.[citation needed] Rohit Khilnani of India Today deemed the music "below average".[132]
