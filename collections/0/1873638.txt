Later, a number of other institutions were initiated in Pakistan under the auspices of or partially supported by the Anjuman. One of such most prominent schools which gained recognition and was later turned into a full-fledged government-run public high school is the Himayat-ul-Islam High School in Hyderabad, Sindh,[3][4] which has two distinct sections, the Himayat-ul-Islam Boys and Girls High Schools. The school was initiated by a prominent Shaikh Sindhi family in Hyderabad in 60's by granting their property with the sole aim of extending English-medium quality education to the masses. The school soon turned into a prominent English-medium public school competing with the leading public and private schools in the city, especially during the 70's and 80's, with prizes and awards in many literary and sports competitions. It has produced a number of prominent personalities in the city and province, civilian and military officers and eminent businessmen, some even gaining world fame such as the Pakistani-American politician Mr. M.J. Khan.
