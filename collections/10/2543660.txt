The Ivor Novello Awards, named after the Cardiff-born entertainer Ivor Novello, are awards for songwriting and composing. The "Ivors" are presented annually in London by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters, and were first introduced in 1955. Ceremonies take place each May and are sponsored by PRS for Music (previously The Performing Right Society). They are respected worldwide as the major platform for recognizing and rewarding Britain's songwriting and composing talents. The Award itself is a solid bronze sculpture of Euterpe â€“ the muse of lyric poetry. Winehouse received three awards from five nominations.
