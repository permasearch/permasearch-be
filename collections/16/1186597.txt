Taraxacum seeds are an important food source for certain birds.[43] Dandelions are also important plants for Northern Hemisphere bees, providing an important source of nectar and pollen early in the season.[44] Dandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). They are also used as a source of nectar by the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), one of the earliest emerging butterflies in the spring.
