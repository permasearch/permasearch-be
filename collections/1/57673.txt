The 2005 World Series was the 101st edition of Major League Baseball's championship series, a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champions Chicago White Sox and the National League (NL) champions Houston Astros.[1] The White Sox swept the Astros four games to none in the series, played between October 22 to 26, winning their third World Series championship and their first in 88 seasons. Although the series was a sweep, all four games were quite close, being decided by two runs or fewer.
