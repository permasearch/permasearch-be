Parsons’ annual Benefit and Fashion Show is a black tie gala that raises funds for scholarships and academic programs at The New School. The event is a collaboration with The New School's College of Performing Arts. A highlight of the event is a runway show featuring the top thesis collections of Parsons’ graduating BFA Fashion Design students, including its Designers of the Year. The Designer of the Year Award has launched the careers of such famous alumni as Marc Jacobs, and Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough of Proenza Schouler.[25] Industry leaders are honored every year, with past honorees including Rihanna, Sarah Jessica Parker, Donna Karan, Arianna Huffington, among others. 2018's 70th Annual Benefit honored Solange Knowles, Marco Bizzarri (President and CEO of Gucci), and José Neves (Founder and CEO of Farfetch)[26]. The show has been a tradition of the school for seventy years.[27]
