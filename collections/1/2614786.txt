The kimono (着物, きもの) [1] is a traditional Japanese garment. Kimono was also known as Gofuku (吳服, ごふく or Wúfú) before the Taishō period (大正時代 , Taishō jidai) [2] since it was basically derived from the local Chinese Hanfu (漢服) [3] in the Wú (吳), which refers to a region in China whose core area is around Lake Tai in Jiangnan (the south of the Yangtze River). Kimono (ki: wear + mono: object = "worn object", "object that is worn") means garment[4] and has come to denote these full-length, usually robes. The standard English plural is kimonos,[5] but the unmarked Japanese plural kimono is also used. Kimonos are often worn for important festivals or formal occasions as formal clothing.
