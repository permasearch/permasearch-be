Posey was born in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports in high school; when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. He attended Florida State University, where he began playing the catcher position. He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called back up to the major leagues in May. With the presence of then full-time catcher Bengie Molina, Posey played first base when originally called up to the majors, but became the Giants' regular catcher at the end of June when Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers, the team the Giants later faced in the World Series.
