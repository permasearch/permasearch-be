Modern snap fasteners were first patented by German inventor Heribert Bauer in 1885 as the "Federknopf-Verschluss", a novelty fastener for men's trousers. Some attribute the invention to Bertel Sanders, of Denmark. These first versions had an S-shaped spring in the "male" disc instead of a groove.[1] Australian inventor Myra Juliet Farrell is also credited with inventing a 'stitchless press stud' and the 'stitchless hook and eye.'[2] In America, Jack Weil (1901â€“2008) put snaps on his iconic Western shirts, which spread the fashion for them.[3] The Prym-company produces snap fasteners since 1903.
