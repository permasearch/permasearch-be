Real progress began in the late 19th century with the building of the USS Holland (SS-1), named after John Philip Holland. The boat was developed at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard located in Elizabeth, New Jersey. This pioneering craft was in service for 10 years and was a developmental and trials vessel for many systems on other early submarines.
