When Tyler arrives, he sees Holly sitting in front of the fireplace, the first place he saw her the morning he woke up in her house previously. Holly tries recreating the weekend as Tyler runs around the house looking for Ali. He discovers Ali unconscious tied mid-air to the ceiling, forehead bleeding. He lowers her down, wakes her up, grabs a fire poker and starts trying to escape the house as Holly goes to get her gun. Tyler and Ali make it outside and before they get away, Holly stops them at gunpoint. Tyler tells Holly that he loves Ali and not her and he never will. Gil shows up behind them calling out Holly's name. Distracted, Holly shoots Tyler in the shoulder then attempts to shoot Gil but misses. Ali picks up the fire poker and stabs Holly in the side, causing Holly to fall back into the pool. Gil and Ali huddle around Tyler while waiting for the police to arrive.
