The development of professional corporate management (executives) in the U.S. began after the Civil War, along with the development of stock markets, industryâ€”and particularly the railroads. Railroads lent themselves to dispersed ownership relying on professional management, because they were far larger, more complex and covered much greater distances than other businesses of the time.[237] One of, if not the earliest example of dissatisfaction with high executive pay in U.S. was when the federal government nationalized the railroad industry during World War I, and the very large salaries of the railroad bosses were made public.[238] After the Securities and Exchange Commission was set up in the 1930s, it was concerned enough about excessive executive compensation that it began requiring yearly reporting of company earnings in hopes of reining in abuse.[238]:16 During World War II, the New York Times denounced President Franklin Roosevelt's unsuccessful attempt to cap Americans' pay at $25,000 (about $331,000 in today's dollars) as a ploy to "level down from the top."[239]
