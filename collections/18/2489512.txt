Vaccination after exposure, PEP, is highly successful in preventing the disease if administered promptly, in general within 6 days of infection. Begun with little or no delay, PEP is 100% effective against rabies.[16] In the case of significant delay in administering PEP, the treatment still has a chance of success.[23]
