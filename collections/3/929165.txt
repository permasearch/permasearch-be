Two martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[78][79] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[80] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[79] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[79][80][81][82]
