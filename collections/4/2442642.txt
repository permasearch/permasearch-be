When the Games begin, Kantmiss grabs a backpack and tries fleeing, but Seleca, the Games' producer, sends Angry Birds to attack her; she defeats them and squashes the Annoying Orange. Peter teams up with a group of contestants led by Marco, who aim to kill Kantmiss. Marco tries to kill her with a spear but it kills one of his allies instead. They flee when she knocks down a beehive using a chainsaw. Kantmiss is stung, and the venom causes her to hallucinate being a Na'vi. She is slapped back to her senses by fellow contestant Rudy; they team up, vowing to kill the other contestants first. After the halftime show is played, Marco again tries to kill Kantmiss, but Rudy kicks his shin. Marco then kills Rudy.
