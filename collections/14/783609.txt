At the beginning of the video, Tyler sees a hobo, and then he starts singing the song, the lyrics matching everything that is happening in the video. He complains about how he hates hobos ("So sick of the hobos always begging for change, I don't like how I gotta work and they just sit around and get paid"), he almost gets hit by a car ("I hate all of the people, who can't drive their cars...), we meet his wife, played by his real wife Christine Danielle Connolly ("I hate how my wife; is always up my ass...), a girl drops her bag of lingerie (Tyler looking at it interestingly), a construction worker's boss telling him off ("I still hate my job, my boss is a dick...), and when he sings the chorus, a sign comes down from a building reading "I Hate My Life." Then, Tyler jumps onto a parade float with the rest of the band, performing the rest of the song. Behind them travels a huge group of people, which include the hobo, the construction workers, and the others Tyler ran into.
