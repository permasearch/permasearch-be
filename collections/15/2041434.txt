During Western Han the Imperial Counselor, also known as the Grandee Secretary and Imperial Secretary, was considered the second-ranking official below the Chancellor.[46] Like the Chancellor, he exercised censorial powers over provincial officials who also sent him annual reports.[47] His primary duty was to uphold disciplinary procedures for officials; he could investigate even those attached to the chancellery and the imperial palace.[47] Since one of his main functions was to prevent abuse of authority, his jurisdiction over officialdom tended to overlap with that of the Chancellor's.[48] His subordinates included the Imperial Clerks (Shiyushi 侍御史; also known as Attending Secretaries), led by the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (Yushi zhongcheng 禦史中丞; also known as the Palace Assistant Secretary).[49] They were often sent out into the provinces to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of local officials.[49]
