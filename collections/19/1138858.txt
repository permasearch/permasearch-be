The video first began receiving airplay in early May, debuting on MTV, MTV2 and The Box.[31] The video was MTV's second-most played video for the week ending August 1,[32] and remained a popular video on the channel for over two years.[33] The video was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 2000 MVPA Awards,[34] but lost to Foo Fighters' "Learn to Fly".[35] The band referenced the clip at the 1999 Billboard Awards, which opened with a clip of the band streaking through Las Vegas.[36] The trio also appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) and Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place in the nude as well.[37] The video gave the band a reputation for nudity that plagued the group's career,[26] leading many critics to pigeonhole them as a joke act.[9] "It became something of an albatross as band members grew up," wrote Richard Harrington of The Washington Post.[37] "You know, when we were filming the video for "What's My Age Again?" the whole naked thing was only funny for like 10 minutes. Then, I was the guy standing naked on the side of the street Los Angeles with cars driving by me giving me the finger and shit. It’s funny watching the video now, but at the time, it stopped being funny ten minutes in, and it definitely wasn’t funny three days into it," recalled Tom DeLonge.[26]
