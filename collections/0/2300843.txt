A gastropub concentrates on quality food. The name is a portmanteau of gastronomy and pub, and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in Clerkenwell, London.[80] The concept of a restaurant in a pub reinvigorated both pub culture and British dining,[81] though has occasionally attracted criticism for potentially removing the character of traditional pubs.[82]
