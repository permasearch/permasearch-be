Episode notes: This was a "nose-to-tail" themed competition. The pig organs in the entrÃ©e round consisted of heart, liver, and kidneys, and the chefs were required to use all three of them. Chef Finn works at Fatty Crab, owned by Chopped judge Zakary Pelaccio (Pelaccio did not appear as a judge in this episode).
