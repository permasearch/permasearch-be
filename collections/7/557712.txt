In contrast to China, women palace attendants managed the palace of the imperial harem rather than eunuchs, and could hold high court offices in the emperors personal household.[29] Female palace attendants were divided in two classes, which in turn had several ranks, signifying their task.[30][pageÂ needed] The first class consisted of the nyokan or ladies-in-waiting who held court offices, naishi-kami (shoji) naishi-suke (tenji) and naishi-no-jo (shoji) and the second class was the female palace attendants myobu, osashi, osue, nyoju.[30] The ladies-in-waiting worked as personal assistants, tending the emperors' wardrobe, assisting the emperors' baths, serving meals, performing and attending court rituals.[29] Ladies-in-waiting could be appointed concubines, consorts or even empresses by the emperor or the heir to the throne.[29] The function of a lady-in-waiting as potential concubine was abolished in 1924.[29]
