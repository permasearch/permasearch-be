The new rule also created the Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) category of aircraft, which are smaller, lower-powered aircraft.  The sport pilot certificate offers limited privileges mainly for recreational use. It is the only powered aircraft certificate that does not require a medical certificate; a valid vehicle driver's license can be used as proof of medical competence provided the prospective pilot was not rejected for their last Airman Medical Certificate.
