In 1998, Hayter voiced protagonist Solid Snake in the highly successful video game Metal Gear Solid. He would reprise the role in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (a remake of the original), Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (where the character appears in aged form as Old Snake). Hayter also voiced Naked Snake, a young version of Solid Snake's "father" Big Boss, who serves as the protagonist in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, which were prequels set prior to the events of the original Metal Gear. Hayter has an extended live-action cameo as himself in Metal Gear Solid 4 in one of the fictional TV programs prior to the start of the game. In the scene, he wears the "Solid Eye", the technologically advanced eye patch that Old Snake wears throughout the game.
