Adventure Gamers found many faults with the character designs, describing them as ugly, and no more realistic than the characters from Sierra's Gabriel Knight 3, released six years previously.[10] However, Just Adventure commented that the characters are nicely designed, with detailed facial expressions during close-ups, but could have been better by current standards.[28] Opinions on the character voice acting were generally positive: praised by Adventure Gamers for injecting life into the wooden character models,[10] and ICGames commented that the voice acting made the characters convincing.[29] However, GameSpy denounced the game for not allowing readers to skip through dialogue, instead forcing them to sit through hours of spoken words.[9] Sound in And Then There Were None received mixed reactions as well, with Game Chronicles calling the sound decent, with realistic weather and animal sounds.[8] 2404, in contrast, said that the game's music is pleasant and unannoying, but never captures the emotions and tensions in the game.[27]
