Arturo Di Modica, who had installed Charging Bull in 1989, has asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploits his work for commercial purposes and alters the perception of the bull.[23] He has called Fearless Girl "an advertising trick" that he wants relocated, citing its political messaging.[24][1] On April 12, 2017, Di Modica and his attorney, former New York Civil Liberties Union director Norman Siegel, challenged city officials who let the Fearless Girl statue be installed.[25][26] Di Modica states the statue corrupts Charging Bull's artistic integrity by distorting the intent of his statue from "a symbol of prosperity and for strength" into a villain, and does so for SSgA's commercial gain.[27][28] Siegel said a lawsuit had not been filed as of yet.[25][26] Mayor de Blasio supported keeping the statue, tweeting that "Men who don't like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl."[29]
