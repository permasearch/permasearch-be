In 2007, there were over 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[47][48] There are eight Islamic mosques spread throughout the island, with most Muslims living in RÃ­o Piedras.[49][50] Puerto Rican converts to Islam continue to occur.[51] "Ties between Latinos and Islam are more than just spiritual, but date back to Spanish history. Many people do not realize that Muslims conquered Spain killing many Christians for more than 700 years".[52] And at times not just individuals, but whole families convert. However, lack of Muslim education in the Island forces some Puerto Rican Muslims to migrate to the States.[52] Islam was brought into Puerto Rico mainly via the Palestinian migration of the 1950s and '60s.[53] Thus, today there is a strong Palestinian presence among Muslims in Puerto Rico. "They are economically strong and are thus able to pay for a full-time Imaam".[54]
