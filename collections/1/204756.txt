An osmotic fragility test can aid in the diagnosis.[14] In this test, the spherocytes will rupture in liquid solutions less concentrated than the inside of the red blood cell. This is due to increased permeability of the spherocyte membrane to salt and water, which enters the concentrated inner environment of the RBC and leads to its rupture.[15] Although the osmotic fragility test is widely considered the gold standard for diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis, it misses as many as 25% of cases. Flow cytometric analysis of eosin-5â€²-maleimide-labeled intact red blood cells and the acidified glycerol lysis test are two additional options to aid diagnosis.[16]
