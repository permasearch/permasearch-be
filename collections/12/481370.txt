The first was in the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final, in which a run out in the final over with only one run required prevented South Africa advancing to the final instead of Australia, who progressed because the latter had a better rank in the previous stage â€“ Super Sixes.[16] The second tied match, in the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, was a case in which the Duckworth-Lewis method caused a South African loss against Sri Lanka. With the onset of rain, the South African batsmen achieved the score they believed was required to win the match and then blocked out the last ball of the over to avoid losing wickets, however, the score they believed indicated a win actually indicated the score required to tie the match. This tie meant South Africa could not advance to the Super Sixes stage.[17] The third tie happened in a group match between Ireland and Zimbabwe at Kingston in the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[18] The fourth tie happened in a group match between India and England at Bangalore in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[19]
