During the 2000s, two more ex-members of the Byrds died when drummer Kevin Kelley succumbed of natural causes in 2002[266] and bassist Skip Battin, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, died at his home in 2003.[261]  Former members Gene Parsons and John York both remain active and continue to perform and record various musical projects.[261]  Perhaps the most surprising development in the Byrds' story during the 2000s, however, was the acquisition by David Crosby of the rights to the band's name in 2002.[267][268]  Ownership of the Byrds' name had reverted to Clarke's estate upon his death in 1993 and Crosby's purchase served to effectively bring the convoluted battle for control of the group's name to an end.
