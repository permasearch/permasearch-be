Caudal vertebrae are the bones that make up the tails of vertebrates.[25] They range in number from a few to fifty, depending on the length of the animal's tail. In humans and other tailless primates, they are called the coccygeal vertebrae, number from three to five and are fused into the coccyx.[26]
