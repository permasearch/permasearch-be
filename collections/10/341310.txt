Jindal tells Vishal that Jibran and Tyson were his rivals. He also confesses that he murdered his wife Pooja (Priya Tendulkar) and Inspector Karan Saxena (who happens to be Amar's father), to cover up the truth, and faked his blindness to throw the police off his trail. Jindal, who has now partnered with his former enemy, Jibran, leaves Vishal to die. Vishal escapes, only to be confronted by Amar. Vishal subdues Amar and tells him the truth. Inspector Sahoo, who is brought to Jindal by Jibran to give him important information about Vishal, tells him that Vishal is alive and will tell the entire truth to Amar and the Commissioner by the next morning. Then Jindal kidnaps the journalist, Roma, and kills the sub-editor Siddiqui, who tries to save Roma. Amar, Vishal and the Commissioner go to Jindal's home to arrest him, but they find the sub-editor, Siddiqui, brutally murdered at his home. They discover that Jindal has kidnapped Roma in order to forcefully marry her. Amar and Vishal find Jindal's den with the help of Inspector Sahoo and corner him.
