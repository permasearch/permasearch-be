where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvins, and ln is a natural logarithm. This expression implies that      K  âŠ–     {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}   must be a pure number and cannot have a dimension, since logarithms can only be taken of pure numbers.      K  c     {\displaystyle K_{c}}   must also be a pure number. On the other hand, the reaction quotient at equilibrium
