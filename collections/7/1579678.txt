Although already behind schedule, Lange felt that the album was still missing a strong crossover hit and that this last song had the potential to be one.[citation needed] Within two weeks the song was completed, smoothed out, and included as the twelfth track on Hysteria.[citation needed] By the spring of 1988, Hysteria had sold 3 million copies, but it still was not enough to cover the album's production costs (the most expensive ever at the time).[citation needed] Thus, the band edited footage from an upcoming concert film to make a new promo clip for "Pour Some Sugar on Me" and finally released it as the fourth single in North America.[citation needed]
