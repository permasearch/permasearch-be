J Sainsbury plc, trading as Sainsbury's, is the second largest chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom,[1] with a 16.9% share of the supermarket sector in the United Kingdom.[2] Founded in 1869, by John James Sainsbury with a shop in Drury Lane, London, the company became the largest grocery retailer in 1922, was an early adopter of self-service retailing in the United Kingdom, and had its heyday during the 1980s. In 1995, Tesco overtook Sainsbury's to become the market leader, and Asda became the second largest in 2003, demoting Sainsbury's to third place for most of the subsequent period until January 2014, when Sainsbury's regained second place.[3]
