Yorkshire pudding is cooked by pouring a batter made from milk (or water), flour and eggs into preheated, oiled, baking pans, ramekins or muffin tins (in the case of miniature puddings). A basic formula uses ​1⁄3 cup flour and ​1⁄3 cup liquid per egg. Water produces a lighter crisper but less sweet pudding than using milk.[8] They can also be baked in the oven in muffin tins.[9] A 1926 recipe involves covering the pudding with greaseproof paper to steam it and then serving it with jam, butter and sugar.[10]
