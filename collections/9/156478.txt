As the series crossed the country to Los Angeles, the visiting Nationals put pressure on Dodgers starter Kenta Maeda from the outset, loading the bases in the first inning on a single and two walks; although they did not score, they forced him to throw 28 pitches. In the Dodgers′ half of the first, Nationals starter Gio González walked Justin Turner, followed by Corey Seager staking L.A. to a 1–0 lead in the first inning, as he had in both previous games of the series, this time with an RBI double.[38]
