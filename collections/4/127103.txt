Catholic theology teaches that a validly-contracted sacramental marriage is accompanied by divine ratification, creating a virtually indissoluble union until the couple consummate, after which the sacramental marriage is dissoluble only by the death of a spouse. An unconsummated marriage can be dissolved by the Pope, as Vicar of Christ.[100] Once a sacramental marriage is consummated, only a separation is possible: the marriage bond cannot be dissolved by any power.
