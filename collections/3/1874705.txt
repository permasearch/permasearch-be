Tomato was originally released by Jonathan Zarate in 2006, building on the code of HyperWRT, and made available on his website polarcloud.com.[2] Since the last release from the original developer in June 2010, continued development happens through several community-maintained mods. Fedor Kozhevnikov created a notable early fork, called TomatoUSB, which ceased development in November 2010.[3] It was then forked by other developers[4] with projects such as Tomato by Shibby becoming popular.[5] Tomato was also used by Asus as base to build its ASUSWRT[6] routers firmware.[7]
