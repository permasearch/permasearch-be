Many of the early modern human finds, like those of Omo, Herto, Skhul, and Pe»ôtera cu Oase exhibit a mix of archaic and modern traits.[40][41] Skhul V, for example, has prominent brow ridges and a projecting face. However, the brain case is quite rounded and distinct from that of the Neanderthals and is similar to the brain case of modern humans. It is now known that modern humans north of Sahara and outside of Africa have some archaic human admixture, though whether the robust traits of some of the early modern humans like Skhul V reflects mixed ancestry or retention of older traits is uncertain.[42][43]
