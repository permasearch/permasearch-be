During the Second Great Awakening, the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area.[15] Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family was caught up in this excitement.[16] Smith later said he became interested in religion by about the age of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism.[17] With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place.[18] Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God.[19] Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.[20]
