Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) finds a screenplay written by Michael called Threat-Level Midnight starring himself as "Agent Michael Scarn", and the staff read it together. While reading the script, the character sequence "Dwigt" appears. Pam explains to the camera that originally, Michael based his incompetent sidekick on Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), but later changed the name with a search and replace. Unfortunately, the search and replace mechanism failed to change Dwight's misspelled name. Dwight is upset and quickly shuts down the exercise to invite everyone to set off fireworks outside, but only Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) follows.
