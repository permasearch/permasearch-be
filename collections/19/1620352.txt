As women age, they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause.  This decline is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles. Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest are wasted.  The decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age,[16] and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52.  As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions.[medical citation needed]
