Lieutenant Declan G. Murphy is first introduced working as an undercover cop whom Rollins comes across while she's on a gambling binge. Shortly after William Lewis escaped from prison, One Police Plaza appointed Murphy commanding officer of Manhattan SVU, deeming it inappropriate for Benson to lead the manhunt to recapture Lewis. Murphy's reign as commanding officer continued after Lewis' suicide at the request of One Police Plaza. Murphy was a strict and by-the-book CO, often checking behind the detectives' backs, ensuring they were apprehending suspects correctly and often using his undercover expertise to lead the direction of investigations. Murphy's strictness often caused him to bump heads with the detectives, mainly Amaro, who did not trust him. Morally, Murphy has shown to be flexible. When Benson was looking at perjury charges after Lewis' suicide, he lied under oath and persuaded the grand jury not to pursue them, stating that Benson did what she had to do to save the girl that Lewis had kidnapped, whether what she had said on the stand had merit or not. However, when Amaro is arrested for his assault on a photographer investigated for child pornography and building a torture chamber that he claimed he used regularly, Murphy tells Amaro that he knows Amaro doesn't value his advice, but to stand down and keep quiet, regardless of the circumstances. After the charges were dismissed, Murphy told Benson that he would do what he could, but he was not going to pull strings for Amaro, as he was unconvinced that Amaro's career was worth saving. At the end of "Spring Awakening", Murphy tells Benson that he has been chosen for an undercover assignment and recommended to One Police Plaza that command of the SVU be returned to her. Subsequently, in the episode "Undercover Mother", Murphy's undercover assignment is revealed after SVU takes down a sex trafficking ring.
