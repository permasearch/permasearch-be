It used to be customary for women with higher titles from one marriage to retain them even on subsequent remarriage.  As Lord Macnaughten put it in the case of Earl Cowley v Countess Cowley [1901] AC 450:  "...everybody knows that it is a very common practice for peeresses (not being peeresses in their own right) after marrying commoners to retain the title lost by such marriage. It is not a matter of right. It is merely a matter of courtesy, and allowed by the usages of society." The divorce court, in the above case, granted the earl an injunction preventing his former wife from using his title; however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal, whose decision was confirmed by the House of Lords, on the grounds that ordinary courts of law lacked any jurisdiction in matters of honour.[5]
