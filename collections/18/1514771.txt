As two human punks from a street gang which was documented to have connections with the Foot Clan, Bebop and Rocksteady were mutated by Shredder into a humanoid warthog and black rhinoceros due to petting a warthog and black rhino that the Foot were keeping in their lair's basement. In time, their animals sides eventually surfaced when dreaming and longing for the "old days" as a regular warthog and rhino in the wild. But this didn't work out for them when facing the Ninja Turtles, and as a result, Shredder banished them to an Eden World in Dimension X. They simply enjoyed their stay there, but returned to Earth with Krang, Amtrax and Bellybomb to resume their service to Shredder and battles against the Turtles.
