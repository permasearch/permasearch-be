In the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday[61] (a.k.a. Bank Holiday). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open. Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.
