In the early 2000s, cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn.[66] In 2001, Boeing dropped plans for a longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, in favor of the proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15Â percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767.[67][68] The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER.[69] Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo.[69] The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003.[69] In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers.[70][71] The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal,[70] resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears.[72] The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[73]
