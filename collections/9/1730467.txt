Looking to continue their winning ways after upsetting the Broncos the previous week, the Bills traveled to Atlanta to take on the Atlanta Falcons, who made it to the Super Bowl the previous season, as FB Patrick DiMarco made his first return to Atlanta since signing with the Bills in free agency. The Bills defense held the Falcons in check for most of the game and TE Charles Clay recorded his first 100-yard receiving game since 2015. A key highlight was a fumble from Falcons QB Matt Ryan that arguably looked like a forward pass, but was ruled a fumble and returned for a 52-yard TD by rookie CB Tre'Davious White. With the win, the Bills improve to 3-1 for the first time since 2011 and regained sole possession of first place in the AFC East with the Patriots losing 33-30 to the Panthers, but lost starting receiver Jordan Matthews and starting linebacker Ramon Humber to multi-week thumb injuries.[12]
