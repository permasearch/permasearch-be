In the episode's conclusion, the jury's votes for Kristie were shown, along with their voting booth confessionals giving their comments: Matt stated he wasn't sure how Kristie managed to persevere, but thought it was "inspiring" and "incredible"; Flick stated that Kristie deserved to be the Sole Survivor; Sue commented "well deserved, good on you...but you're still a naughty little girl"; Brooke confessed that while she had never expected Kristie to even make it to end, let alone get her vote, Kristie won her over with her Final Tribal Council performance; Jennah-Louise commended Kristie for beating the odds, getting to the end, and living her dream; Sam simply held up his vote for Kristie and plainly stated "this game definitely has a sick sense of humor"; Kylie proclaimed that she believed that Kristie "owned" her game; Finally, Nick was uncharacteristically silent as he cast his vote for Kristie, but after placing it in the urn he whispered to himself "Wow...I can't believe I just did that," and walked away from the podium.
