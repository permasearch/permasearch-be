The 2ZZ-GE is a 1.8 L; 109.6 cu in (1,796 cc) version built in Japan. Bore x stroke is 82 mm × 85 mm (3.23 in × 3.35 in). It uses Multipoint Fuel Injection, VVTL-i, and features forged steel connecting rods. Compression ratio is 11.5:1, necessitating "premium" gasoline (91 octane or above in the (R+M)/2 scale used in North America[6]). Power output for this engine varies depending on the vehicle and tuning, with the Celica GT-S, Corolla T-Sport,[7][8] Lotus Elise and Lotus Exige offering 141 kW (189 hp), but the American versions of the 2003 Matrix and Pontiac Vibe versions developing only 180 hp[6] with all later years offering anywhere from 173 hp in 2004 to 164 hp in 2006 due to a recurved powerband. The differing power figures from 2004 through 2006 are due to changes in dynamometer testing procedures. The Australian variant Corolla Sportivo produces 141 kW at 7,600 rpm and 181N·m of torque. Due to noise regulations, Toyota recalled them for a flash of the PCM to up their output to classify them in the more lenient "sports car" noise category.  The Corolla Compressor and Lotus Exige S add a supercharger with intercooler to achieve 225 hp (168 kW), while the Exige 240R's supercharger increases output to 240 hp (179 kW). The addition of a non-intercooled supercharger to the Elise SC produces 218 hp (163 kW) with a considerable weight saving. The supercharged engines are not labeled 2ZZ-GZE.
