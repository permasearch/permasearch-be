The first European to explore the coast was Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo, sailing for the Spanish Crown; in 1542, Cabrillo's expedition  sailed perhaps as far north as the Rogue River in today's Oregon.[7]  Beginning in 1565, the Spanish Manila galleons crossed the Pacific Ocean from Mexico to the Spanish Philippines, with silver and gemstones from Mexico.  The Manila galleons returned across the northern Pacific, and reached North America usually off the coast of northern California, and then continued south with their Asian trade goods to Mexico.
