By February 2016, Cordova-Buckley was cast as "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez, based on the comic Secret Warrior of the same name.[109] Cordova-Buckley learned of the role after she had been cast in the series, and subsequently researched the comics for inspiration. She described the character, as she is initially introduced in the series, as a freedom fighter who "in a lot of ways she wants to help her people in Colombia and she wants to do good with her powers and she makes sure that she’s very adamant on how she goes about things." She also noted the rarity of the character's spirituality, saying that she "has this whole spiritual connection to her powers which is rare to ever see in a super hero movie...She wants to use [her powers] as what she calls a blessing and a gift from God to help others, so it’s a very unique approach to it all".[110] When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character.[111] Before the start of the fifth season, it was revealed that Cordova-Buckley had been promoted to series regular.[112]
