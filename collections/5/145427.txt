On some winter mornings it can be just −3 °C (26.6 °F) in Milan's Dome plaza while −8 to −9 °C (17.6 to 15.8 °F) in the metropolitan outskirts, in Turin  can be just −5 °C (23.0 °F) in the city centre and −10 to −12 °C (14.0 to 10.4 °F) in the metropolitan outskirts. Often, the largest snowfalls happen in February, sometime in January or March; in the Alps, snow falls more in autumn and spring over 1,500 m (4,921 ft), because winter is usually marked by cold and dry periods; while the Apennines see many more snow falls during winter, but they are warmer and less wet in the other seasons.
