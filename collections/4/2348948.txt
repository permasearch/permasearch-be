Banks entered the 1966 FIFA World Cup as England's first choice goalkeeper, and his understudies Ron Springett and Peter Bonetti never took to the field during the tournament. England opened the tournament with a goalless draw against Uruguay, with Banks a virtual spectator as the highly defensive Uruguayans rarely ventured out of their own half.[86] They then defeated Mexico 2–0, with Banks again rarely troubled throughout.[87] A 2–0 win over France then took England through the group stage without Banks conceding a goal.[88]
