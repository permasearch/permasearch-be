A writedown is sometimes considered synonymous with a write-off.[2] The distinction is that while a write-off is generally completely removed from the balance sheet, a writedown leaves the asset with a lower value.[3] As an example, one of the consequences of the 2007 subprime crisis for financial institutions was a revaluation under mark to market rules: "Washington Mutual will write down by $150 million the value of $17 billion in loans".[4]
