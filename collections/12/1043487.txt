There are many companies that manufacture .38 Special ammunition.  It can range from light target loads to more powerful defensive ammunition.  Because of the relatively low pressure that the .38 Special cartridge and even its more powerful +P version can be loaded to, most 38 Special bullets do not expand reliably, even when using hollow-point designs, especially if fired from a short-barreled or 'snub-nose' revolver. In 2004, Speer Bullets introduced the Gold Dot jacketed hollow-point .38 Special cartridge in an attempt to solve this very problem.  Another solution is to use an unjacketed soft lead hollow-point bullet as found in the FBI Load.[22]  The latter's 158-grain soft lead hollow point is loaded to +P pressures and velocity, which ensures more reliable expansion in unprotected flesh, even when fired in a 2-inch short-barreled revolver.[22] Various YouTube videos seem to indicate that hollow point 38 Special projectiles (and 380ACP) that have a plastic filler in the concavity achieve more consistent expansion.  Some brands call that a 'ballistic tip'.
