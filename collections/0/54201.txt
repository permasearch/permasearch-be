Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but has also included pickup trucks in the past. Some of Jeep's vehicles, such as the Grand Cherokee and the Wagoneer, reach into the luxury segment. Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016, up from 500,000 in 2008,[4][5] two-thirds of which in North America,[6] and was Fiat-Chrysler's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017.[7] In the U.S. alone, over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles, and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company, it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion â€” slightly more than all of FCA (US).[6][5]
