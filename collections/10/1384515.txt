Khalil Ibrahim organized the Seekers of Truth and Justice that originally supported the National Islamic Front (NIF) and famous Islamist, Hassan al-Turabi.[3]  After the NIF took power and continued to marginalize the Darfur region in the same way which the previous administration had, Ibrahim distanced himself from the group and took on a new independence in his organization.[4]  	The members were mostly men who began looking to Islam in their youth as an answer to their nation’s political issues. The Muslim Brotherhood advocated that political Islam would bring honest and equal commitment to all Muslims.[5] The group’s core support consisted of Zaghawa tribe members, specifically of the Kobe branch to which Ibrahim belonged.[6] It is also speculated that many Zaghawa decided to join militias after the government failed to enforce a peace agreement from years earlier, requiring Arab nomads to “pay blood money for the Zaghawa they had killed.” [7] Possible original members of the group based on their seniority positions in JEM include Zakaria Abbas, Omar Karma, Hamid Yusef El Mahil, Salih El Tom Abbas, and Hamid Musabil.[8]
