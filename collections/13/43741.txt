Chinese Buddhist temples, administrated by local governments, have become increasingly commercialized by sales of tickets, incense, or other religious items; soliciting donations; and even the listing of temples on the stock market and local governments obtain large incomes. In October 2012, the State Administration for Religious Affairs announced a crackdown on religious profiteering.[56] Many sites have done enough repairs and have already cancelled ticket fares and are receiving voluntary donation instead.[57][58]
