After the engagement, Ronit is outside lying on his car, staring at the stars. Pooja comes and asks him what he is thinking about. Ronit says he is imagining how Pooja will look at their engagement and marriage will be. Pooja says that it will be great to get the elders' blessings for their wedding. Ronit says he will try his best to make his parents agree, but if they don't, they shouldn't ruin their lives and not end up getting married. He jokes with Pooja and says what type of house she wants, how many servants. Pooja says she just wants a house where she can be with Ronit (aww) and says they will live in a small house and that she will make a big film.
