In Spain, where the word sandwich is borrowed from the English language,[18] it refers to a food item made with English sandwich bread.[19] It is otherwise known as a bocadillo. Similar usage applies in other Spanish-speaking cultures, such as Mexico, where the word torta is also used for a popular variety of roll-type sandwiches.
