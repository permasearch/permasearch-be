When Rani sees the British mistreating villagers outside Jhansi, she persuades them to fight. She finds Samar Singh (who helps her) and Karma (who wants to kill the maharaja). Captain Martin promises Karma the leadership of the villages if he works for them, but he then betrays him. Rani saves Karma, who becomes an ally. Martin challenges Rani (disguised as a man, Raja) to fight against a madman; Raja wins the fight, but is then revealed as Rani. The maharaja takes her back as the maharani; Martin retires, and is replaced by Captains Malcom and Ross.
