China and Russia signed the agreement on simplification of visa procedures on 22 March 2013 and the agreement went into effect on 26 April 2014. The agreement stipulates the conditions of issuing multiple-entry visas to citizens of Russia who are of certain occupations and regulated visa fees. Single-entry visas are US$50, while double-entry and multiple-entry visas are capped at US$100 and US$150.[38][112] The agreement also stated that visa fees are to be paid in the national currencies of both countries, and due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble in 2014 and 2015, Chinese missions in Russia increased the visa fees in ruble by 120 percent on 8 July 2016 in order to reflect the most recent conversion rate to U.S. dollar.[113]
