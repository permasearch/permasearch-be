It is election day. Randolph Scripps, a late candidate, is creating more trouble than interest;  Goldblume takes an interest.  Daniels, expecting to win, offers to put Furillo forward as the next Chief.  Deputy Chief Mahoney, overhearing, goes public with Daniels' and Furillo's roles in the failed Robson prosecution.  Commander Ozzie Cleveland wins the election handily, and Goldblume narrowly prevents Scripps from stabbing the new mayor.  Wachtel continues his comeback - still in women's clothes.  Jimmy Robson's funeral takes place.  Furillo spends time with Mike Perez Junior, the teenage son of Officer Mike Perez. Mike Junior has been bullied following Jimmy Robson's killing; Mike Senior remains in a psychiatric ward, traumatized by Jimmy Robson's death.
