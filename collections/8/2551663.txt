Radical Republicans such as William P. Fessenden of Maine and Charles Sumner supported FrÃ©mont. Fessenden described Lincoln's action as "a weak and unjustifiable concession to the Union men of the border states" and Sumner wrote in a letter to Lincoln how sad it was "to have the power of a god and not use it godlike."
