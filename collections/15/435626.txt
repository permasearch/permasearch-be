In "Love Stings," Scorpion gets Mr. Ping to fall in love with her because it is revealed that she also can cook. However, this is only as part of her revenge on Po and the Valley of Peace. She was using Mr. Ping because he is the person who is responsible for the Moon cakes for the Moon Cake Festival where all the members of the Valley of Peace will eat Moon cakes. Therefore, Scorpion with the help of Mr. Ping who loves her bakes the Moon cakes but she adds poison into them that renders the whole population into a dizzy-like state. However Po (who practiced with Monkey his own form of dizzy Kung Fu) is able to battle her and defeat her. After Mr. Ping finds out about the treachery, they split.
