The Edward Bear Revue, later Edward Bear, was formed in 1966 by singer and percussionist Larry Evoy and bassist Craig Hemming. The name is derived from A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh, whose "proper" name is Edward Bear.[1] At first the band had a bluesy, rock sound; at one point they opened for Led Zeppelin.[2][3]
