Freedom of association in the workplace may be defined as "those legal and moral rights of workers to form unions, to join unions of their choice and to demand that their unions function independently."[97] It also includes the right of workers to participate in these unionsâ€™ lawful activities. "Freedom of association must therefore be seen," according to Budeli, "as the foundation of the collective bargaining process,"[98] which contributes to ensuring fairness and equity in labour matters, and to facilitating orderly and stable industrial relations.[99]
