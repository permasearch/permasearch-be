Series creator Masashi Kishimoto had likened Guy's passionate personality to that of a physical education teacher he had in junior high school, but notes that the teacher was not a model for Guy's character.[68] In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Masashi Ebara (who also voices Guy's father, Duy), with Masayuki Makiguchi voicing him as a child. In the English anime, Guy is voiced by Skip Stellrecht (except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Matthew Mercer), with Todd Haberkorn voicing him as a child.[69][70]
