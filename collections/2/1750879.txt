Chaining involves reinforcing individual responses occurring in a sequence to form a complex behavior. It is a process of connecting a set of individual stimulus responses in sequential order.[9] There are two different types of chains: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The prior homogeneous chains occur when the form of response is similar in each element. By contrast, a heterogeneous chain requires different types of responses for each link.[10]
