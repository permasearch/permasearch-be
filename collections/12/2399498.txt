Nemu Kurotsuchi (涅 ネム, Kurotsuchi Nemu) is the lieutenant of Squad 12, a rather introverted and passive woman who prefers to stay silent in her captain's presence. Also known as Nemuri VII (Nemuri Nanagō), Nemu is created by Mayuri Kurotsuchi as a part of the Nemuri Project to create new life through use of Gigai (義骸, artificial bodies) and Modsouls (義魂, gikon).[44] Unlike her "older sisters", Nemu outlived them. Though Mayuri refers to Nemu as his "daughter", he hides his joy towards Nemu and creates a farce of seeing her as nothing more but a tool to use as decoy. But Nemu did learn the truth from Akon, keeping it to herself while having compassion for others as seen when she saves Uryū Ishida's life in gratitude of the Quincy sparing Mayuri. Often when she does speak it is in a subdued monotone, and at least one comical instance she mixes up the colloquial usage of the word "cheese!" when taking a picture with the word "butter." During Mayuri's fight with Pernida, Nemu acted against Mayuri's orders to save him from the Quincy, revealing to have modified her body strength while increasing her decomposition rate. Despite Mayuri's chastising, Nemu throws him to a safe distance as she proceeds to fight Pernida on her own. She ultimately sacrifices herself to have Perinda suffer an agonizing death from her cellular makeup, though Mayuri saves her brain from being eaten.[45] While Nemuri's lieutenant position is taken over by Akon, who formerly filled the 3rd Seat position, Mayuri creates the younger Nemuri VIII (眠八號, Nemuri Hachigō) as his new assistant.
