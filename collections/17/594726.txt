Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, South Carolina,[18] and Wyoming[19] require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. Illinois,[20] Texas[21] and Vermont[22] require it be registered within 30 days, while North Carolina allows up to 60 days.[23] New York requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so.[24] The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.
