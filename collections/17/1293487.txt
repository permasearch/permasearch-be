Fishers also select for forest floors with large amounts of coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire regularly removes understory debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat.[27][31][32] Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.[33]
