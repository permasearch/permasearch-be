The ancient Ashokan edicts of the Mauryan age around 269 BEE record emperor Asoka's conquest of Kalinga, roughly the modern state of Odisha. The major rock and pillar edicts mention the massive human toll of about 100,000 due to the war. The edicts record that an even larger number later perished, presumably from wounds and famine.[11] From Hindu literature, there is the 7th century famine due to failure of rains in Tagore district mentioned in the Periya Puranam. According to the Purana, Lord Shiva helped the Tamil saints Samarkand and Appear to provide relief from the famine.[12] Another famine in the same district is recorded on an inscription with details such as "times becoming bad", a village being ruined, and cultivation of food being disrupted in Landing in 1054.[13] Famines preserved only in oral tradition are the Dvadasavarsha Panjam (Twelve-year Famine) of south India and the Durga Devi Famine of the Deccan from 1396 to 1407.[12][14] The primary sources for famines in this period are incomplete and locationally based[12]
