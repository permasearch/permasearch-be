On March 21, 2013, Timberlake posted an audio clip on his official website; in it he elaborated that "Mirrors" is very special song for him. The singer explained that the single is a love song about a person's other half and admitted that it was inspired by the marriage of his grandparents. Timberlake further said, "One of the most valuable things in a relationship is being able to constantly change and be individual, but look to the other side to the person that you're with and know that they're changing as well individually, but somehow you two can mirror each other and be the other half of that world that you both create."[3]
