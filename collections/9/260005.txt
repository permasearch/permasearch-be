Cronkite lived in Kansas City, Missouri, until he was ten, when his family moved to Houston, Texas.[8] He attended elementary school at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School,[12] junior high school at Lanier Junior High School (now Lanier Middle School) and high school at San Jacinto High School, where he edited the high school newspaper.[6] He was a member of the Boy Scouts. He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), entering in the Fall term of 1933,[13] where he worked on the Daily Texan and became a member of the Nu chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity.[14] He also was a member of the Houston chapter of DeMolay, a Masonic fraternal organization for boys.[citation needed] While attending UT, Cronkite had his first taste of performance, appearing in a play with fellow student Eli Wallach. He dropped out in 1935, not returning for the Fall term, in order to concentrate on journalism.[13]
