Calibration laboratories are generally responsible for calibrations of industrial instrumentation.[9] Calibration laboratories are accredited and provide calibration services to industry firms, which provides a traceability link back to the national metrology institute. Since the calibration laboratories are accredited, they give companies a traceability link to national metrology standards.[2] Examples of calibration laboratories would be ICL Calibration Laboratories[68], Testo Industrial Services GmbH[69], and Transcat[70].
