The song is part of Act One of Oliver!, and is sung in Fagin's lair. It begins with spoken dialogue between Nancy and the Artful Dodger, soon leading into the song. Other characters who have lines in the song are Oliver, Fagin and Bette (Nancy's younger sister in the musical; her best friend in the 1968 film and in the original novel), with Fagin's Boys as chorus.
