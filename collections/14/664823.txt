While the notion of preemptive defense can be supported by an individual state's foreign policy, it is not supported by international humanitarian law nor the UN Charter.[2] Exacting military intervention on the basis of evidence of a "likely 'large scale' killing" (where large scale is not defined) presents a problem where intent does not follow through with action. One may argue that the genocide (or similar atrocity) did not eventuate because of the military intervention; however, the genocide may have also not eventuated due to natural inaction or reduced support.
