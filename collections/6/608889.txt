Many articles include some witticism; image captions are often humorous puns and the letters section usually concludes with an odd or light-hearted letter. These efforts at humour have sometimes had a mixed reception. For example, the cover of the 20 September 2003 issue, headlined by a story on the WTO ministerial meeting in CancÃºn, featured a cactus giving the middle finger.[61] Readers sent both positive and negative letters in response.[62]
