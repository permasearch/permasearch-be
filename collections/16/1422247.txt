Having already been a member of the Essex Academy since the age of 16,[27] Cook was given his first-class debut for Essex coming straight out of school at the end of the 2003 season against Nottinghamshire; put in to field he aided the first dismissal with a catch before falling short at 13 runs in his first innings but pushing Essex to a nine wicket victory with 69 not out in the second.[28][29] Despite relegation being assured to Essex, Cook still battled away with an opening stand of 122 opposite Will Jefferson in the second innings of his second match, against Warwickshire.[30] In the six innings he participated in, he quickly racked up three half centuries[25] at an average of 47.80.[31] Having secured his place as opener in the county team, he made his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire in May 2004 with 126[32] opposite Jefferson's 128 for a 265 opening stand, Essex's third highest[27] but failed to secure promotion for the team.
