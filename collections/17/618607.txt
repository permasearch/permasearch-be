where      T  s     {\displaystyle T_{s}}   is the temperature of the sea surface,      T  o     {\displaystyle T_{o}}   is the temperature of the outflow ([K]),     Δ k   {\displaystyle \Delta k}   is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg]), and      C  k     {\displaystyle C_{k}}   and      C  d     {\displaystyle C_{d}}   are the surface exchange coefficients (dimensionless) of enthalpy and momentum, respectively.[30] The surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as     Δ k =  k  s   ∗   − k   {\displaystyle \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k}  , where      k  s   ∗     {\displaystyle k_{s}^{*}}   is the saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and     k   {\displaystyle k}   is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface.
