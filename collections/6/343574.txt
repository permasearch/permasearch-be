NNSVs can also bind to cellular receptors throughout the pro-inflammatory cytokine pathway in order to inhibit the immune response.[25] By carrying accessory proteins which directly bind to pattern recognition receptors, the virus is able to use its accessory proteins to induce conformational changes throughout other immune response proteins and inhibit cellular responses.[27] Generally, the pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting infection associated molecules commonly associated with viruses, but the accessory proteins that some viruses may carry reconfigure the protein in order to inhibit its function and block the rest of the signaling cascade which would originally produce an immune response.
