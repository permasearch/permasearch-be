Ganesha appeared in his classic form as a clearly-recognizable deity with well-defined iconographic attributes in the early 4th to 5th centuries CE.[154] Some of the earliest known Ganesha images include two images found in eastern Afghanistan. The first image was discovered in the ruins north of Kabul along with those of Surya and Shiva. It is dated to the 4th-century.[155] The second image found in Gardez has an inscription on Ganesha pedestal that has helped date it to the 5th-century.[155] Another Ganesha sculpture is embedded in the walls of Cave 6 of the Udayagiri Caves in Madhya Pradesh. This is dated to the 5th-century.[155] An early iconic image of Ganesha with elephant head, a bowl of sweets and a goddess sitting in his lap has been found in the ruins of the Bhumara Temple in Madhya Pradesh, and this is dated to the 5th-century Gupta period.[156][155][157] Other recent discoveries, such as one from Ramgarh Hill, are also dated to the 4th or 5th centuries.[155] An independent cult with Ganesha as the primary deity was well established by about the 10th century.[154] Narain summarizes the lack of evidence about Ganesha's history before the 5th century as follows:[154]
