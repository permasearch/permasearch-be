Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times.[200] Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed.[200] In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s.[200] Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry.[200] Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists.[200] Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid.[200] The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years.[201] Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.[201]
