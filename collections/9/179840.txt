New York City baroque pop band Antony and the Johnsons (led by Anohni) was named in Johnson's honor,[18] and their eponymous 1998 album features a song called "River of Sorrow," which is inspired by Johnson's life and passing. The song is featured in the Pay it No Mind documentary.[3] In 1993 Anohni appeared in a play about Johnson and International Chrysis by the Hot Peaches,[20] the same theater group with whom Johnson had performed. Anohni also wrote and directed a play about Johnson, "The Ascension of Marsha P. Johnson" at the Pyramid Club in 1994 and at PS122 in NYC in 1995.[29]
