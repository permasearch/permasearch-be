Section 138 states that the Chief Justice is appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). Similarly, Justices are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the JSC. The appointments are validated by warrants signed by the President and sealed with the Public Seal. Before assuming office, Justices must take prescribed oaths.[4]
