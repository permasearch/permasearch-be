Though disheartened by the amount of corruption in the palace, Ja'far's mood is lifted when he meets Scheherazade, a storyteller and palace entertainer who has just had her ear cut off by one of her masters. As Jafar stitches the wound, Scheherazade tells Ja'far of the story of the Tiger Head Cave and shows him her half of a golden scarab necklace which, when combined with the other half, will reveal the location of the hidden Tiger Head Cave. Though Ja'far is a man of facts and science, he is charmed by Scheherazade's wisdom and beauty. As Ja'far and Scheherazade get to know each other, they fall in love and marry ("A Thousand and One Nights"). A few years later, Ja'far continues to struggle against the corruption and incompetence of the palace, but one day Scheherazade announces that she is pregnant. Ja'far is overjoyed, especially since the couple has been trying for some time to conceive. Suddenly, a guard informs Ja'far that his request to meet with the Sultan has been granted and he is to report to the palace immediately.
