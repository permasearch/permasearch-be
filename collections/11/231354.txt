The District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[213] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools has steadily increased.[214] As of fall 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[210] The District is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[215] The District of Columbia Public Library operates 25 neighborhood locations including the landmark Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.[216]
