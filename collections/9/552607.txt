In November 2003, elections to the Generalitat gave the plurality, but not the majority of seats to CiU. Three other parties (Socialists' Party of Catalonia–Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, PSC-PSOE, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV)) united to take the government into a left-wing nationalist coalition, making Pasqual Maragall, (PSC-PSOE) the new president of Catalonia. This government proved unstable, especially on the issue of reforming the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. The Statute was approved by the Parliament of Catalonia on September 30, 2005, and subsequently it was sent to the Cortes Generales for review and discussion. They approved the law on May 10, 2006, in June 18 Catalan citizens ratified the Statute, and have been in force since August 9, 2006. The new Statute of Autonomy consolidated the self-government, and included the definition of Catalonia as a nation in the preambule.[68] The internal tensions of Catalan Government provoked new elections, it were held in autumn 2006. The result was again a plurality, but not a majority, for CiU, and PSC-PSOE, ERC and ICV again formed a coalition, with José Montilla (PSC-PSOE) as president.
