Tech came into the game with a 9–1–1 record that included an unusual forfeit win over Temple. The Owls, who had played the game with an ineligible player, won the game on the field, but later forfeited the victory to Virginia Tech.[40] Facing the Hokies in the 1986 Peach Bowl were the 18th-ranked Wolfpack from North Carolina State University.
