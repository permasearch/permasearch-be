Most countries in the world have sales taxes or value-added taxes at all or several of the national, state, county, or city government levels.[11] Countries in Western Europe, especially in Scandinavia, have some of the world's highest valued-added taxes. Norway, Denmark and Sweden have higher VATs at 25%, Hungary has the highest at 27%[12][13] although reduced rates are used in some cases, as for groceries, art, books and newspapers.[14]
