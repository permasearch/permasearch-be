In the early 1970s, a New Iranian Cinema emerged (cinema motefÃ¤vet). However, following the Revolution in 1979, a few filmmakers and actors went into exile as Khomeini altered the focus in features. Between 1979 and 1985, about 100 features were released.[16] While Khomeini's censorship remained, the small number of features produced focused on sexual display and European influence.[16]
