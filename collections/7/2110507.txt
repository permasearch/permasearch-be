Due to its world, its diversity of industrial resources and the cultural diversity of the Venezuelan people, Venezuelan cuisine often varies greatly from one region to another. Its cuisine, traditional as well as modern, is influenced by its European[1] (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French), West African and Native American traditions. Food staples include corn, rice, plantain, yams, beans and several meats.[1][2] Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, eggplants, squashes, spinach and zucchini are also common sides in the Venezuelan diet.
