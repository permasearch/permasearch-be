Whereas absolute fitness determines changes in genotype abundance, relative fitness (    w   {\displaystyle w}  ) determines changes in genotype frequency. If     N ( t )   {\displaystyle N(t)}   is the total population size in generation     t   {\displaystyle t}  , and the relevant genotype's frequency is     p ( t ) = n ( t )  /  N ( t )   {\displaystyle p(t)=n(t)/N(t)}  , then
