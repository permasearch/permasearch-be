On Monday, December 3, 2012, Eagles coach Andy Reid announced that Foles would start for the remainder of the year, regardless of when Michael Vick returned from a concussion.[25] The following Week 14 game on December 9, Foles earned his first win as a starter in the Eagles' 23–21 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With two seconds remaining on the clock and Philadelphia down 21–16 at the Bucs' one-yard line, Foles threw a 1-yard pass to Jeremy Maclin for the game-winning touchdown as time expired. Foles completed 32-of-51 passes for 381 yards and two touchdowns – both coming in the final four minutes. He also had 27 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[26] On December 23, Foles broke his hand against the Redskins, and was replaced by Vick in the season finale against the New York Giants.[27] On December 26, Foles was placed on injured reserve.[28]
