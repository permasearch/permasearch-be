Colorado wines include award-winning varietals that have attracted favorable notice from outside the state.[69] With wines made from traditional Vitis vinifera grapes along with wines made from cherries, peaches, plums and honey, Colorado wines have won top national and international awards for their quality.[70] Colorado's grape growing regions contain the highest elevation vineyards in the United States,[71] with most viticulture in the state practiced between 4,000 and 7,000 feet (1,219 and 2,134Â m) above sea level. The mountain climate ensures warm summer days and cool nights. Colorado is home to two designated American Viticultural Areas of the Grand Valley AVA and the West Elks AVA,[72] where most of the vineyards in the state are located. However, an increasing number of wineries are located along the Front Range.[73] In 2018, Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Colorado's Grand Valley AVA one of the Top Ten wine travel destinations in the world.[74]
