Ecosystems are dynamic entitiesâ€”invariably, they are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.[10] When an ecosystem is subject to some sort of perturbation, it responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of a system to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its resistance. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its resilience.[10]
