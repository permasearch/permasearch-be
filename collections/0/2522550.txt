After hearing an announcement that the show was going to continue, Captain Weaver confronted Director Hoye and reiterated that the show should be called off. The two agreed, and began walking to the stage to make a second announcement. However, at 8:46 p.m., a wind gust (possibly a gustnado) hit the stage structure. Just when it hit, the stage collapsed—before they were able to announce the evacuation.[2]
