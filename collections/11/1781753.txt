Teaching of computing at the University of Colombo first started in 1967 with the setting up of the Statistical Unit as a separate unit of the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Science.[2] Later with the initial guidance of Professor V. K. Samaranayake, the Statistical Unit was enhanced as the Statistical Consultancy and Data Processing Service Center.[2] Starting with this center, in 1985 Samaranayake convinced the university to set up the Department of Statistics and Computer Science (DSCS).[3] This is considered as the starting point of the UCSC.[4] A batch of 50 students were taken to study computer science, through the University Grants Commission in 1997.[2] In 2001, the DSCS separated into the Department of Computer Science (DCS) and the Department of Statistics (DS).[2] Finally, UCSC was formed in 2002 by the merger of the existing Department of Computer Science of Faculty of Science and the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) both of the University of Colombo.
