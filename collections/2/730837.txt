Korean popular music (K-pop), considered by some to be the most important aspect of the Korean Wave,[35] is a music genre that relies on cultural technology to adapt to the tastes of foreign audiences and has now grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults in many places around the world.[36] Although it has spread to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America,[37] its reception in the Western world has so far been lukewarm.[38] However, social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easier for K-pop musicians to reach a wider audience in the West.[39] According to Mark James Russell from Foreign Policy, while the Korean Wave "may not (yet) turn heads in Los Angeles or London", this could soon change because of "Gangnam Style".[37]
