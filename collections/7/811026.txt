Described by his father an idiotic and problematic child, Gong Tae-kang is widely known as a liar and troublemaker in school. His father is the director of Sekang High School and his mother is a famous actress, but his classmates don't know about this. He is portrayed as a happy-go-lucky person who just wanted to cause trouble, but behind his smile, he was actually a struggling child with a painful life. He suffered a lot but everything changed when he met Lee Eun-bi who stood by his side, even when Kang So-young decided to make her life hell. He confessed to her later on, but was rejected by Lee Eun-bi.
