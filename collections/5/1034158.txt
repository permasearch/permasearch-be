In 2003, the Special Edition and Sport trim levels were discontinued (the Special Edition trim level would reappear for 2004). A new, A/M-F/M stereo with integral six-disc CD changer was available, and replaced the now-discontinued six-disc remote CD changer. A new, factory-installed A/M-F/M stereo with integral CD player and GPS navigation system became available midyear that replaced the previously-available dashboard-mounted unit. A new 28E Package was now available for the base Laredo trim level that offered the 4.7L PowerTech V8 engine at a budget-oriented price point. A Freedom trim level was available, based on the Laredo trim level. A coin console tray now replaced the ashtray in the center console, and high-back cloth front bucket seats were now standard equipment on the base Laredo trim level (low-back cloth bucket seats still remained available as an option, however). Production of the 2003 model year Grand Cherokees began in August of 2002, which was the shortest model year for the Grand Cherokee.
