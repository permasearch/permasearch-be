Galungan marks the time when the ancestral spirits visit the Earth. The last day of the celebration is Kuningan, when they return. The date is calculated according to the 210-day Balinese calendar. The series of Hindu religious ceremonies that are performed during this ten-day festival period are generally considered to be the most important ones of Hindu Bali. During this period the followers of the Balinese Hindu Dharma religion focus on the importance of living a life based on dharma.[87][88] The most obvious sign of the celebrations are the penjorâ€”bamboo poles with offerings suspended at the end. These are installed by the side of roads.
