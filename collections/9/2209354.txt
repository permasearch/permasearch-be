The clashes for the Copa RÃ­o de La Plata between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s.[1] In 1948, the South American Championship of Champions (Spanish: Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones), the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores, was played and organized by Chilean club Colo-Colo after years of planning and organization.[1] Held in Santiago, it brought together the champions of each nation's top national leagues.[1] The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of Brazil.[1][5][6]
