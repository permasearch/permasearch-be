The mission of the Colors element is to display and bear the American flag (known as the National), Air Force flag and the flags of the native countries of visiting dignitaries at Air Force events and as part of the other services' honor guards for Joint Service ceremonies. A Colors element member is also responsible for carrying the USAF Honor Guard guidon. A color team usually comprises four individuals: the Non-Commissioned Officer-in-charge (NCOIC) of the team (known as the NCT) who carries the National and commands the team, the Air Force flag bearer (known as the USAF), and two rifle guards whose responsibility is to guard the flags. These two individuals are armed with Springfield M1903 rifles (or "O3's"). Color teams evolved from the custom of carrying the colors onto the battlefield during the 18th and 19th centuries to identify the location of the combatants and to inspire pride and confidence in them. The battle streamers that hang from the top of the Air Force flagstaff symbolically represent every conflict and campaign that the Air Force has participated in since its inception in 1907 as the U.S. Army Aeronautical Division. The streamers weigh in at nearly 40 pounds in addition to the weight of the flag and the staff. There are ceremonies in which additional flags are carried as well which can increase the size of a color team to as many as eight members or more.
