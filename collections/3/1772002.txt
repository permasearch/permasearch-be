After 1931 Yan continued to give nominal support to the Nanjing government while maintaining de facto control over Shanxi, alternatively cooperating with and fighting against Communist agents active in his province. Although he was not an active participant, Yan supported the 1936 Xian Incident, in which Chiang Kai-shek was arrested by Nationalist officers led by Zhang Xueliang and released only when he agreed to make peace with the Communists and form a "united front" to resist the impending Japanese invasion of China. In his correspondence with Zhang Xueliang in 1936 Yan indicated that the growing rift between he and Chiang was due to Yan's anxieties over the potential for a Japanese invasion and a concern for the subsequent fate of China, and because Yan was not convinced of the correctness of focusing China's resources on anti-Communist campaigns.[6] During the Xian Incident itself Yan actively involved himself in the negotiations, sending representatives to prevent Chiang's execution (and the civil war that Yan believed would follow) while pushing for a united front to resist the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent.[20]
