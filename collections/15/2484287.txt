After traveling to Philadelphia for a new passport, because he misplaced the other one, and then flying from JFK Airport, Bam and friends arrive in Helsinki, Finland to find directions to Santa's house. Their first stop was at the rehearsal area for HIM, Bam's favorite band and personal friends, who draw a map on Mark Hanna's chest with marker, then play "Dead Lovers' Lane" to close for Bam. Before leaving, Bam decides to get the map drawn by Ville Valo tattooed on the Mark's chest so it doesn't get lost. With complete directions, they all leave on a train north to Tampere where they run into The Dudesons, Jarppi and Jukka. The next morning, before heading towards Santa, Novak persuades the group to go to a Hanoi Rocks concert where friend Andy McCoy tells them they must hike about nine hours to reach Santa once they've reached Rovaniemi. During a night in the Finland wilderness, Bam cuts off Joe Frantz's long hair while Frantz sleeps by the campfire. Frantz wakes up, finds that part of his hair is gone, and in a rage, trips into the fire pit.
