PCIT is typically administered once a week, with 1-hour sessions, for 10-14 sessions total and consists of two treatment phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). The CDI component focuses on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship, which will help promote changes in behavior. This sets the foundation for the PDI stage, which continues to encourage appropriate play while also focusing on a structured and consistent approach to discipline.[1]
