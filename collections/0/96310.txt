As background, Stan Kostka had a huge college career as a U of M running back, leading the Minnesota Gophers to an undefeated season in 1934. Every NFL team wanted to sign him. Since there was no draft back then, savvy Stan did the smart thing - he held out for the highest offer. While a free agent, Stan kept busy, even running for Mayor of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Although his political career did not take off, Stan's nine-month NFL holdout succeeded and he became the league's highest-paid player, signing a $5,000 contract with the NFL's team in Brooklyn, New York on August 25, 1935. As a response to the bidding war for Stan Kostka, the NFL instituted the draft in 1936.[1]
