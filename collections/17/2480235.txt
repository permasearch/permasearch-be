In recent years, the role of the CFO has evolved significantly. Traditionally being viewed as a financial gatekeeper, the role of the CFO has expanded and evolved to a strategic partner and advisor to the CEO. In fact, in a report released by McKinsey, 88 percent of 164 CFOs surveyed reported that CEOs expect them to be more active participants in shaping the strategy of their organizations. Half of them also indicated that CEOs counted on them to challenge the companyâ€™s strategy.[2] However a 2016 survey of CFOs suggests that their new role has been overhyped with 52% of CFOs still finding themselves bogged down in the basics of traditional accounting practices such as transaction reporting and unable to make time for business partnering.[3] The rise of digital technologies and a focus on data analytics to support decision making impacting almost every industry and organisation will only add more pressure for CFOs to address this tension on finding the time to make the time to meet the expectations of their C-Suite colleagues. Many organisations have embarked on the journey to help achieve this by creating a finance function based on four distinct pillars - An Accounting organisation structured as a shared service, an FP&A organisation responsible to drive financial planning processes as well as driving increased insight into financial and non financial KPIs that drive business performance, a Finance Business Partnering organisation that supports the leadership of divisions, regions, functions to drive performance improvement and, last but not least, expertise centres around the areas of Tax, Treasury, Internal Audit, M&A etc.
