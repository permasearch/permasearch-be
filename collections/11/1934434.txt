Field hosted a gala political fundraiser for Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the estate in 1992 where Barbra Streisand performed a concert in the formal garden for 1,200 of Hollywood's most influential, including Warren Beatty, and a relatively unknown heavy contributor Ron Burkle, who would end up buying the property the next year.[27] In 1993, billionaire and Democratic Party fundraiser Ron Burkle bought the home for $20 million â€“ $19 million less than the $39 million asking price (which had included a valuable art collection of old masters paintings in the original asking price) but still among the highest prices paid for a home in the United States in the previous three years.[27][28] On May 20, 1994, the estate hosted yet another gala fundraiser attended by President Bill Clinton at which R&B singer Natalie Cole performed.
