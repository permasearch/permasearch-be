A water cooler effect is a phenomenon, occurring when employees at a workplace gather around the office water cooler and chat.[4] It is a synonym for gathering and connecting people in a certain environment (e.g. the office). When a television program, like a soap-opera or series, is talked about among many people (mostly related to guessing what will happen in the next episode) it can be said that the program has a water cooler effect.
