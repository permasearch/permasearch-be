Gacy later stated that the second time he committed murder was around January 1974. The victim is believed to have been an unidentified teenage youth with medium brown, curly hair estimated to be aged between 14 and 18 whom Gacy strangled[107] before stowing the youth's body in his closet prior to burial. Gacy later stated that fluid leaked out of this youth's mouth and nose as he was stored in his closet, staining his carpet.[108] As a result of this experience, Gacy later stated he regularly stuffed cloth rags or the victims' own underwear in their mouths to prevent a recurrence of this incident. This particular unidentified victim was buried about 15 feet (4.6Â m) from the barbecue pit in Gacy's backyard.[109][n 3]
