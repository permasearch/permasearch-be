Chevrolet began production of its all-steel "carryall-suburban" in 1935. GMC brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the "Suburban Carryall" until GM cut the name to simply "Suburban". GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named "Suburban" as well, until re-branding it to "Yukon XL" for the 2000 model year.
