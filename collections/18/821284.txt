Petyr descends from a Braavosi sellsword who served House Corbray. His father befriended Lord Hoster Tully during the War of the Ninepenny Kings, and Tully took the young Petyr as a ward. Petyr grew up at House Tully's castle Riverrun with Hoster's daughters Catelyn and Lysa and his son Edmure, the latter of whom gave Petyr the nickname "Littlefinger" as a reference to his short stature and his family's lands on the smallest of the Fingers. He was a sly, mischievous child with the ability to always look contrite after his mischief.[1] He became infatuated with Catelyn and claims to have lost his virginity to her while drunk; in reality, he lost it to Lysa, who was herself obsessed with him. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark (Eddard Stark's elder brother), Petyr brazenly challenged him to a duel for her hand in marriage but lost easily to Brandon. His life was spared at the behest of Catelyn.[2] During his convalescence, he impregnated Lysa but the pregnancy ended in a forced abortion and Petyr was banished from Riverrun.
