The nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2).[65] For example, the ISS,[66] Mars Odyssey[67] and the Mars Global Surveyor[68] are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009,[69] more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.[70]
