From the efforts at the Walnut Street Jail and Newgate Prison, two competing systems of imprisonment emerged in the United States by the 1820s. The "Auburn" (or "Congregate System") emerged from New York's prison of the same name between 1819 and 1823.[111] And the "Pennsylvania" (or "Separate System") emerged in that state between 1826 and 1829.[111] The only material difference between the two systems was whether inmates would ever leave their solitary cellsâ€”under the Pennsylvania System, inmates almost never did, but under the Auburn System most inmates labored in congregate workshops by day and slept alone.[111]
