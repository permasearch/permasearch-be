Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassmentâ€”for example, in American English a rubber is usually interpreted as a condom rather than an eraser;[3] and a British fanny refers to the female pubic area, while the American fanny refers to an ass (US) or an arse (UK).
