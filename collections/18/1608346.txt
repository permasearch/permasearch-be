On May 14, 2018, the World Health Organization reported that "the Democratic Republic of Congo reported 39 suspected, probable or confirmed cases of Ebola between April 4 and May 13, including 19 deaths."[193] Some 393 people identified as contacts of Ebola patients were being followed up. The outbreak centered on the Bikoro, Iboko, and Wangata areas in Equateur province,[194] including in the large city of Mbandaka. The DRC Ministry of Public Health has approved the use of an experimental vaccine.[195][196][197] On May 13, 2018, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited Bikoro.[198] Reports emerged that maps of the area were inaccurate, not so much hampering medical providers as epidemiologists and officials trying to assess the outbreak and containment efforts.[199] The 2018 outbreak in the DRC was declared over on July 24th, 2018.[16]
