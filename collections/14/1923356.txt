The Buckeyes got the ball to start the game and Justin Zwick was the starting quarterback.  He led his team to advance only five yards in three plays so they punted from their own 46 yard-line to the UT eleven yard-line.  Less than five minutes into the game, Texas scored first on a field goal by David Pino.[37]  The 42-yard kick was a career-long for Pino and also the first of what would be a career-high (single game) three field goals.[38]  Ohio State strung together 11 plays for 64 yards but had to punt.  With 1:37 to play in the first quarter, Texas extended this lead to 10–0 with a five-yard touchdown pass from Vince Young to Billy Pittman.  Troy Smith came into the game for the first time and was still leading the Buckeyes at the end of the first quarter.[37]
