Part of southwestern New Jersey was settled by the Swedes by the mid-17th century.[10] New Sweden, founded in 1638, rose to its height under governor Johan Björnsson Printz (1643–53). Led by Printz, the settlement extended north from Fort Christina on both sides of the Delaware River. Printz helped to improve the military and commercial status of the colony by constructing Fort Nya Elfsborg, near present-day Salem on the east side of the Delaware River. This action prevented the river from being easily taken by the English and Dutch, who were also trying to expand into the New World. The Swedish and Finnish colonists generally lived in peace with their Dutch and Lenape neighbors.[11] C. A. Nothnagle Log House and Schorn Log Cabin are remainders of this early influence. (New Sweden's colonial population may have peaked at 368 people in 1654, after being boosted by more than 250 people along with new governor Johan Rising. This was not enough to stave off 317 Dutch soldiers the next year, however.[12] At least one online source[13] asserts that some 600 colonists settled in New Sweden; it is unclear from that source how many were in New Sweden at any one point in time.)
