Municipal officers work on minor crimes on a local basis, from traffic offences to small-time drug dealing and illegal camping. Each town or city has its own police department but they have limited jurisdiction and duties. Local officers can check driving licences, enforce municipal laws and ordinances and carry out investigations for robbeies and minor offences, but they cannot form a "riot squad" or interfere with homicide or general investigations by the Police or Carabinieri.
