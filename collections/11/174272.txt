In September 2011, The NATO alliance invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile defence (BMD).[99][100] According to the reports a top NATO official stated addressing Indian representatives, "You have a missile threat that confronts you. We have a missile threat that confronts us. Itâ€™s a different one, but our ability to defend against it could be the same. We have cooperation on those kind of issues. [..]Democracies face challenges that are common. We need to work together and resolve. We need to cooperate, because individually we cannot deal with such threats. It is better to deal with such issues commonly than deal with them individually"[99] V. K Saraswat, the architect of Indian BMD program, subsequently informed, "We are analysing the report. It is under consideration."[100]
