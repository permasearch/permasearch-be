In December 2017, the Swiss parliament launched a standing initiative and expressed an interest in formally embedding banking secrecy within the Swiss Constitution making it a federally-protected constitutional right.[34][35] In January, 2018, a U.S. district court ruled that Swiss bankers "[have] nothing to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes to not declare offshore assets", later clarifying they should not be seen as facilitating tax evasion but rather providing a legal service that is made illegal by the client.[36] The Swiss Justice Ministry announced in March 2018 that anyone who disclosed client information in a pending court case involving a Swiss bank is subject to federal espionage and extortion charges in addition to charges relating to the violation of banking secrecy laws.[37]
