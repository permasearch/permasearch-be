In March 2010 the ACF rejected a statement by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi who had recommended a break-up of Nigeria along religious lines, saying he was ignorant of the diverse religious make-up of the country.[15] The ACF condemned the recent killings in Plateau State, which had triggered Gaddafi's remarks, describing them as "senseless".[16] That month the ACF formed a Political Committee headed by former Minister of State of Power and Steel, Mohammed Ahmed Gusau. The committee's goal was to set the ACF agenda ahead of the 2011 elections.[17]
