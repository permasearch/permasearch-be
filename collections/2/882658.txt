Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations developed in the absence of animal power and complicated agricultural tools. In Mesoamerica, there was extensive cultivation of maize, accomplished by hand-held digging stick, and harvesting of the ripened cobs done manually. In the Andes, with steep hillsides and relatively little flat land for agriculture, the indigenous built terraces to increase agricultural land. In general, there was no such general modification of the topography in Mesoamerica, but at the southern, freshwater portion of the central lake system, indigenous peoples built chinampas, mounds of earth for intense cultivation. In Mesoamerica there were no large domesticated animals prior to the arrival of the Spaniards to ease labor or provide meat, manure, or hides. In the Andes, the staff of life and main carbohydrate was the potato, also cultivated with human labor. The llama, a New World cameloid, could be used as pack animals for relatively light loads and were a source of wool and meat.[16] There were no wheeled vehicles in either region. In both Mesoamerica and the central Andes cultivated cotton, which was woven into lengths of textiles and worn by locals and rendered in tribute.
