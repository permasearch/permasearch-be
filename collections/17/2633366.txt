Casting was complete within two weeks of the start of production. In late November, AB-PT said actress Mala Powers was being considered for the female lead.[11] But on December 2, the studio revealed that Peter Graves and Peggie Castle had been cast as the leads.[12][19] Three days later, AB-PT announced that Don C. Harvey, Morris Ankrum, Pierre Watkin, Ralph Sanford, and Richard Benedict had also been cast.[22] The studio also said that Pat Dean, its "sexboat" discovery (and a former dancer at the El Rancho Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada) would also appear in the picture.[22] Larry Blake, Duane Cress, James Douglas, Eileen Jannsen, John Kranston, Ann Loos, and Jeanne Wood were added to the cast a few days later.[23] Ankrum, Henry, and Seay were cast because they usually played military men in B movies, roles they portrayed in Beginning of the End as well.[24]
