Marriage is the moment at which a new household is formed, but different arrangements may occur depending upon the type of marriage and some polygamous marriages do not result in the formation of a single household. In many polygynous marriages the husband's wives may live in separate households often at a great distance.[citation needed] They can thus be described as a "series of linked nuclear families with a 'father' in common".[23]
