In Islam, no verse in the Quran supports male or female circumcision (FGM/C).[57] Male circumcision is a widespread practice and considered mandatory for Muslim males according to Sunnah.[58] Muslim scholars disagree whether any authentic Sunnah in the hadiths supports the practice of female circumcision.[59][60][61] The Ijma, or consensus of Muslim scholars, varies by the Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) on whether circumcision is optional, honorable or obligatory for Muslim male and females.[note 1] Prominent Islamic scholars have both supported and opposed FGM/C for female Muslims.[62][63][note 1][note 2]
