The poverty of Esperanza’s own neighborhood is consistently addressed throughout the book. The neighborhood is full of people in either denial of their own social position or are content enough with the small pleasures to aid in distracting them from their own socio-economic oppression. In the chapter “Our Good Day,” Esperanza and her soon-to-be close friends pitch in money to purchase one bicycle. They are very content with the sharing of ownership of the bicycle as it brings them some joy. The low cost of the bicycle and the need to scrounge up the money to purchase it, is an example of the poverty of Esperanza’s neighborhood.
