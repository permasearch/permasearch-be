Behavioural parent training (BPT) or parent management training (PMT), focuses on changing how parents interact with their children and equips them with ways to recognize and change their child's maladaptive behaviour in a variety of situations. BPT assumes that individuals are exposed to reinforcements and punishments daily and that anti-social behaviour, which can be learned, is a result of these reinforcements and punishments.[29] Since certain types of interactions between parents and children may reinforce a child's anti-social behaviour, the aim of BPT is to teach the parent effective skills to better manage and communicate with their child.[22] This could be done by reinforcing pro-social behaviours while punishing or ignoring anti-social behaviours.[29] It is important to note that the effects of this therapy can be seen only if the newly acquired communication methods are maintained.[29] BPT has been found to be most effective for younger children under the age of 12.[11][22] Researchers credit the effectiveness of this treatment at younger ages due to the fact that younger children are more reliant on their parents.[30] BPT is used to treat children with conduct problems, but also for children with ADHD.[22]
