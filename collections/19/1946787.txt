At the time of his MMR research study, Wakefield was senior lecturer and honorary consultant in experimental gastroenterology at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine (from 2008, UCL Medical School). He resigned in 2001,[44] by "mutual agreement and was made a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists",[45] and moved to the US in 2001[46] (or 2004, by another account[45]). He was reportedly asked to leave Royal Free Hospital after refusing a request to validate his 1998 Lancet paper with a controlled study.[24]
