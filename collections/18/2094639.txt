During the first season Roxy is forced to quickly adapt to life at Fort Marshall and her role as an Army wife. Her naivete was often a source of comedy in the show. For example, she personally pleads with Trevor's platoon sergeant SFC Hendrix in front of the entire platoon to spare him for the day after learning that he has blisters on his foot; this backfires as Trevor was mercilessly teased about the incident by SFC Hendrix and his platoon mates for the rest of the exercise and given the demeaning nickname "Baby Soft".[2] During her first divisional banquet she salutes a bemused Major Frank Sherwood when he was notifying Trevor about being accepted into jump school. In Season 5 she talks the housing officer into reviewing hers and Trevor's housing situation by using his rank and her friendship with Claudia Joy Holden, much to Trevor's embarrassment.
