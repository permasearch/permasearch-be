In the list following are 38 people whose deaths are directly attributable to the Chernobyl disaster. Of these, two died at the scene, four died in a single helicopter accident, 29 died within a few months of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and three died later, perhaps from medical complications probably[dubious – discuss] caused by the accident. One was a cinematographer, one a physician, five military personnel (four in a single helicopter), seven firefighters, two security guards and the rest staff at the power plant or subcontractors. At least one other person is reported to have died of a coronary thrombosis at the scene, and nine children are reported to have died of thyroid cancer (in 2005 that number was raised to 15[9]), but identifications are not known. No members of the general public were hospitalized in the month following the accident,[10] though a pair of fishermen, Pustavoit and Protasov, reportedly received 400 REM doses.[11] There were a total of 137 confirmed cases of ARS, including Pyotr Palamarchuk who survived after a reported exposure to 800 roentgens, twice the usual death dose.[12]
