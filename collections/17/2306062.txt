The WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play is a match play knockout professional golf event which is one of the four annual World Golf Championships. The tournament is the only of the four WGC events to not be played as a stroke play event. From its 1999 founding until 2014, the tournament was held in late February. Beginning in 2015, the tournament was moved to the first weekend in May. In 2016, the event moved to Austin, Texas and was held during the last week of March. The tournament was originally sponsored by Anderson Consulting/Accenture, and in the years since, it has also been sponsored by Cadillac and Dell.
