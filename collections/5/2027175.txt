Clinical trial costs vary depending on trial phase, type of trial, and disease studied. A study of clinical trials conducted in the United States from 2004 to 2012 found the average cost of phase I trials to be $1.4 million and $6.6 million, depending on the type of disease. Phase II trials ranged from $7 million to $20 million, and phase III trials from $11 million to $53 million.[73]
