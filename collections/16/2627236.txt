According to Carl W. Ernst the earliest figures of Sufism are Muhammad himself and his companions (Sahabah).[38] Sufi orders are based on the "bay‘ah" (بَيْعَة bay‘ah, مُبَايَعَة mubāya‘ah "pledge, allegiance") that was given to Muhammad by his Ṣahabah. By pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahabah had committed themselves to the service of God. According to Islamic belief, by pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahabah pledged allegiance to God.[39][40][38]
