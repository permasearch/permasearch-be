Members of the United States Armed Forces are covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Under the UCMJ, sworn military personnel, whether of enlisted, warrant or commissioned rank, have a right to remain silent that was established 16 years before the Miranda v. Arizona ruling.[80] There are significant protections against coercive self incrimination in Article 31, UCMJ,[81] but it does differ somewhat from the Miranda warning, and in essence provides greater protections.[80] This is one difference between civilian and military justice in the United States, and many other nations have similar corollary rules regarding military justice vs. civilian justice.[82]
