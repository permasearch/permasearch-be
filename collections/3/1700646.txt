Professor Roger Wilson (David Calder) was Alex's supporter in his expedition of The Dragon Emperor's Tomb, but is really in league with General Yang, who wishes to resurrect the Emperor. After excavating the Emperor's petrified body and placed in a museum in Shanghai, Wilson requested that Rick and Evelyn Carnahan-O'Connell bring The Eye Of Shangri-La to there, which would be used to resurrect The Emperor. Wilson insists that the newly resurrected Emperor take him with him, but The Emperor kills Wilson by severing his head with his flaming fingers.
