During the Joint Session, these eminent psychiatrists, motivated by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to "Pavlovian" doctrines.[45] These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the closing speech Snezhnevsky, the lead author of the Session's policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists "have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing "grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice". The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of "diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science".[46] Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session — among them Irina Strelchuk, Vasily Banshchikov, Oleg Kerbikov, and Snezhnevsky — were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions.[45] Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.[45]
