Vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Waymon Boone and bassist James Cruz formed the alternative pop/rock quartet Splender in 1997. The New York-based group went through various incarnations, eventually choosing drummer Marc Slutsky after he responded to an advertisement in the Village Voice and lead guitarist Jonathan Svec. Boone is the son of an R&B and Jazz singer, and toured with his mother in his youth.
