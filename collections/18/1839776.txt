In August 2007, Patch's autobiography The Last Fighting Tommy was published, making him one of the oldest authors ever.[30] With the proceeds from this book, Patch decided to fund an Inshore Lifeboat for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and he attended the RNLI's Lifeboat College on 20 July 2007, to officially name the boat The Doris and Harry.[31]
