In the winter of 2005, Bong found Jean-Marc Rochette's French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige at a graphic novel shop near Hongik University and finished reading the entire series while standing in front of the bookshelf where he found it.[81][82] He was fascinated by ideas of people struggling on the train for survival, and how every section is classified in social stratification. Bong showed the series to his friends, fellow director Park Chan-wook and producer Lee Tae-hun, who loved it as well.[83] Although Bong praised the original graphic novel, he soon realized that a film like Snowpiercer needed an original take. Bong stated, "[â€¦] I had to come up with a completely new story and new characters in order to create a new, dynamic Snowpiercer that was packed with cinematic exhilaration."[84]
