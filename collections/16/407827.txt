1. Approach your suppliers and persuade them to let you purchase the inventory on 1-2 month credit terms, but keep in mind that you must sell the purchased goods, to consumers, for money. 2. Effectively monitor your inventory management, make sure that itâ€™s often refilled and with the help of your supplier, back up your warehouse.
