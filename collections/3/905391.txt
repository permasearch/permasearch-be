Despite the ban on factionalism, the Workers' Opposition continued its open agitation against the policies of the Central Committee, and before the 11th Party Congress (March 1922) the Workers' Opposition made an ill-conceived bid to win support for their position in the Comintern.[14] The Comintern, not unexpectedly, supported the position of the Central Committee.[14] During the 11th Party Congress Alexander Shliapnikov, the leader of the Workers' Opposition, claimed that certain individuals from the Central Committee had threatened him.[15] Lenin's reply was evasive, but he stated that party discipline needed to be strengthened during "a retreat" â€“ the New Economic Policy was introduced at the 10th Party Congress.[15] The 11th Party Congress would prove to be the last congress chaired by Lenin, he suffered one stroke in May 1922, was paralysed by a second in December later that year, was removed from public life in March 1923 and died on 21 January 1924.[16]
