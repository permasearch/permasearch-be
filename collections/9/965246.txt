Lancelot was eventually able to free the captive Gwen and led her through the lower levels of Hengist's stronghold while being pursued by several of the warlord's followers. He urged her to leave him behind while he fought them off and Gwen ran, though not before swearing to him that her feelings for him "would never fade". Lancelot was subsequently captured and sentenced to be eaten by the wildren Hengist kept. Gwen too was recaptured before she could escape. Before they could be killed, however, they were rescued by Arthur and Merlin, who had come seeking Gwen. The obvious bond that had grown between Lancelot and Gwen caused some jealousy from Arthur, who was also developing feelings for her. Lancelot noticed this and decided to leave, considering Arthur more worthy of Gwen's hand. He departed without saying goodbye, asking Merlin to tell her that "some things can never be". He would not return to Camelot for some years.
