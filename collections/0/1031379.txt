Veld (/vɛlt/ or /fɛlt/), also spelled veldt, is a type of wide open rural landscape in Southern Africa. Particularly, it is a flat area covered in grass or low scrub, especially in the countries of South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. A certain sub-tropical woodland ecoregion of Southern Africa has been officially defined as the Bushveld by the World Wide Fund for Nature.[1] Trees are found only in a few places—frost, fire and grazing animals allow grass to grow but prevent the growth of trees.
