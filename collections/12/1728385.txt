The English Tudor-styled Tally Ho hotel was conceived by owner Edwin S. Lowe, a New York toy manufacturer who also served as the president of the hotel.[2][3] Lowe, who believed that there were some Las Vegas tourists who were not interested in gambling, chose not to add a casino to the Tally Ho.[3] The hotel was built on the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Dunes resort.[4] Construction of the Tally Ho was underway in March 1962, with an opening planned for July.[5] In May 1962, the Clark County Ground Water Board denied an application for a water well that would be used for a nine-hole pitch and putt golf course, which Lowe planned to construct at the rear of the property.[4] A nine-hole golf course was ultimately added to the final plans.[6]
