Each 1982 action figure featured 5 points of articulation (poseable head, arms and legs), removable armor, a weapon accessory and a spring-loaded "Power punch" at the waist. All 8 characters featured the twist waist action, but it was Wave 2 that saw the introduction of additional action features unique to the character, such as Tri-Klops' rotating visor and Ram Man's spring-loaded legs. Each figure would also come packaged with a mini-comic. The line debuted in 1982 with just four figures to begin with: He-Man, Man-At-Arms, Skeletor and Beast Man. Later that year the remaining four characters from Wave 1 were released. They were Stratos, Teela, Mer-Man and Zodac. Each figure came with removable armor, a weapon and mini-comic. The Comet Warriors, Stonedar and Rokkon, arrived in the UK a full year before the rest of their wave 5 counterparts. This may have been due to their appearance in the UK Masters of the Universe fortnightly magazine in 1986. Originally Beast Man was going to be He-Man's archrival, Stratos was an Evil Warrior and Mer-Man and Tri-Klops were both intended to be Heroic Warriors. This changed by the time of their release.
