In English-speaking nations, the three most common family names are often written and pronounced as "Kim" (김), "Lee" or "Rhee" (이, 리), and "Park" (박). Despite official Korean romanization systems used for geographic and other names in North and South Korea, personal names are generally romanized according to personal preference.[citation needed] Thus, a family name such as "Lee" may also be found spelled "I", "Yi", "Rhee", and "Rhie".[33]
