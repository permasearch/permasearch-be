Until the 1990s, child-sized double basses were not widely available, and the large size of the bass prevented children from playing the instrument until they grew to a height and hand size that allowed them to play a ​3⁄4-size model (the most common size). Starting in the 1990s, smaller ​1⁄2, ​1⁄4, ​1⁄8, and even ​1⁄16-sized instruments became more widely available, so children could start younger.
