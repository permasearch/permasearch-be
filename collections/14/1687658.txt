However, in CUA, societal benefits and costs are often not taken into account. Furthermore, some economists believe that measuring QALYs is more difficult than measuring the monetary value of life through health improvements, as is done with costâ€“benefit analysis. This is because in CUA you need to measure the health improvement effects for every remaining year of life after the program is initiated. While for Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) we have an approximate value of life ($2 million is one of the estimates), we do not have a QALY estimate for nearly every medical treatment or disease.
