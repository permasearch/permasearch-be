Lady Gaga was expected to give the store an exclusive expanded edition of her then upcoming album Born This Way, but ended the deal after discovering that Target had donated to a political action group that supported an anti-gay candidate.[140] Refusal to stock Ocean's album also brought on accusations of homophobia by Ocean's manager, who later apologized for saying so.[141] Target has since taken action to support the LGBT community, by stocking gay pride merchandise and donating half of the profits to GLSEN.[142]
