The show's research team developed an annotated document, or "Writer's Notebook", which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development.[59] The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points,[60] provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material.[61] Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.[62]
