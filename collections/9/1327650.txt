Owing to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached in which every province would be dealt a share of the benefits of the capital: the administration would be seated in Pretoria[6] (Transvaal), Parliament would be in Cape Town[7] (Cape Province), the Appellate Division would be in Bloemfontein[8] (Orange Free State). Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg (Natal) were given financial compensation.[9]
