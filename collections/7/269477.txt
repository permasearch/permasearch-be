There is no strong scientific data concerning the origins of pelagic plastics.[dubious â€“ discuss][citation needed] In a study published in 2014,[13] researchers sampled 1571 locations throughout the worlds oceans, and determined that discarded fishing gear such as buoys, lines, and nets accounted for more than 60%[14] of the mass of plastic marine debris. According to a 2011 EPA report, "The primary source of marine debris is the improper waste disposal or management of trash and manufacturing products, including plastics (e.g., littering, illegal dumping) ... Debris is generated on land at marinas, ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains. Debris is generated at sea from fishing vessels, stationary platforms and cargo ships."[15] Pollutants range in size from abandoned fishing nets to micro-pellets used in abrasive cleaners.[16] Currents carry debris from the west coast of North America to the gyre in about six years,[5] and debris from the east coast of Asia in a year or less.[17][18]
