Suzy Johnson (voiced by Kari Wahlgren), known as Little Suzy Johnson, is Jeremy's little sister. She has a high-pitched squeaky voice and appears very sweet and innocent. However, she is actually very spoiled and manipulative and very possessive over Jeremy, once telling Candace, "There is only one girl in Jeremy's life" and thus will do anything to keep Candace away from her brother.
