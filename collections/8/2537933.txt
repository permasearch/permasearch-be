The inclusion of renewable energy distributed generation and AMI in the modern electricity grid has introduced many alternative rate structures.  Simple (or fixed) rate, tiered (or step) rate, TOU, demand rates, tiered within TOU, seasonal, and weekend/holiday rates are among the few residential rate structures offered by modern utilities.  The simple rate charges a specific dollar per kilowatt ($/kWh) consumed.  The tiered rate is one of the more common residential rate programs, and it charges a higher rate as customer usage increases. TOU and demand rates are structured to help maintain/control a utility’s peak demand.  The concept at its core is to discourage customers from contributing to peak-load times by charging them more money to use power at that time.
