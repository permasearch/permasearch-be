The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) launched an investigation into the safety of the device in late 2015[31] and determined that the lithium-ion battery packs in the self-balancing scooters/hoverboards could overheat and posed a risk of catching fire/exploding, and that defects had led to 60 fires in over 20 states.[32] In July 2016 the commission ordered the recall of over 500,000 units from 8 manufacturers. The Swagway model X1 constituted the majority of the recalled "hoverboards," at 267,000 units.[33][34]
