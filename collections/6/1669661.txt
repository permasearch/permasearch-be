At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Cyrus said that Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (untitled at the time) "might take me five years" to finish: "I'll just work on it until I'm done". According to the singer, the album is "about music [and is] not about twerking".[9] In January 2015 Cyrus expressed her intention "to get this stuff out ASAP", adding that she was working on the album nearly every day.[32] Although Bangerz cost "a couple million" dollars to produce, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz cost about $50,000; she said that RCA Records, her label, did not hear the final product until she completed it.[33] The album does not count towards her multi-album recording contract with the label, but RCA said: "Miley Cyrus continues to be a groundbreaking artist. She has a strong point of view regarding her art and expressed her desire to share this body of work with her fans directly. RCA Records is pleased to support Miley's unique musical vision".[33]
