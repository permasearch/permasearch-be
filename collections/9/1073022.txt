Texas' win over USC was their ninth consecutive victory when facing a ranked opponent.[173] Texas broke USC's winning streak (then the longest in the nation) at 34 and claimed the longest running winning streak for themselves at 20 wins in a row.[181][182] Texas' 20-game winning streak was the second-longest winning streak in school history; Texas had 30 wins in a row from 1968 to 1970.[183] Texas extended the winning streak to 21 before a September 9, 2006, loss to Ohio State University. In beating USC, Texas defeated a No. 1 ranked team for the first time since defeating Alabama in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1965.[184] The Longhorns ended the season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage (.7143).[185]
