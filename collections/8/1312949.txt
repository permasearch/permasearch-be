The initial stages of the Industrial Revolution had much to do with larger military forcesâ€”it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip larger forces.

France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the Confederation of the Rhine and other allies.[110]
