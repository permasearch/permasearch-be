The 169th Street station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line provided an unsatisfactory terminal setup for a four track line, and this required the turning of F trains at Parsons Boulevard, and no storage facilities were provided at the station. Therefore, the line was going to be extended to 184th Place with a station at 179th Street with two island platforms, sufficient entrances and exits, and storage for four ten-car trains. The facilities would allow for the operation of express and local service to the station.[140][141] Construction on the extension started in 1946, and was projected to be completed in 1949.[141] The extension was completed later than expected and opened on December 11, 1950.[142] This extension was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. Both E and F trains were extended to the new station.[142][143]
