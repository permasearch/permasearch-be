Later during the season, Mourinho maintained a strongly critical position against refereeing in Italy, which reached its peak during the league game on 22 February 2010 against Sampdoria, ended in a 0–0 tie, with two Inter players being sent off in the first half. At the end of the first half, Mourinho made a handcuffs gesture towards a camera which was considered by the Italian Football Federation as violent and critical of the refereeing performance, and caused a three-game ban against the Portuguese coach.[67] Also, his difficult relationship with young striker Mario Balotelli and the team's loss of form that led Inter to achieve only seven points in six games (and three of such games, including a shock 1–3 defeat at the hands of Sicilian minnows Catania, happening during Mourinho's ban) were heavily criticised by the media and pundits. Despite this, Mourinho achieved what was hailed as one of his career highlights after Inter managed to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals by defeating his former team Chelsea in both legs (2–1 win at San Siro, then followed by a 1–0 win at Stamford Bridge).[68]
