Blending inheritance is a 19th century concept implied by some contemporary theories of evolution, implying that the inheritance of any characteristic would operate by averaging out the parents' values of that characteristic. This would mean that crossing a red flower variety with a white variety of the same species would yield pink-flowered offspring.
