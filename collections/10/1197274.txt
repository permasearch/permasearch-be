In 2001, Ford Australia also built some stroked, 5.6 L (5,605 cc, 342 cu in) Windsors with reworked GT40P heads (featuring larger valves), a unique eight-trumpet inlet manifold, long-throw crank, H-beam rods, and roller rockers. They produced 335 hp (250 kW) at 5,250 rpm and 369 lb⋅ft (500 N⋅m) at 4,250 rpm.[5] The 5.6 litres of displacement were reached by lengthening the stroke from 76.2 mm (3.0 in) to 86.4 mm (3.4 in).[6]
