In 2010 N.K. Anisjutkin discovered Oldowan flint tools at Bayraki that are 800,000â€“1.2 million years old.[23] During the Neolithic stone-age era, Moldova's territory stood at the centre of the large Cucuteni-Trypillian culture that stretched east beyond the Dniester River in Ukraine and west up to and beyond the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. The people of this civilization, which lasted roughly from 5500 to 2750 BC, practised agriculture, raised livestock, hunted, and made intricately-designed pottery.[24]
