Singing in many languages has been Aalto's passion since childhood[22] and she has performed to many international groups visiting Finland. One popular example is "Let it go" in 15 languages [23] that she made for one group of 20 different nationalities.[24] Aalto can sing in many languages, but she has studied English, Swedish, French, Japanese and Chinese.[25]
