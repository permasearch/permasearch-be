Already in 1566 William I of Orange had asked for Ottoman support. As Suleiman the Magnificent claimed that he felt religiously close to the Protestants, ("since they did not worship idols, believed in one God and fought against the Pope and Emperor")[22][23] he supported the Dutch together with the French and the English, as well as generally supporting Protestants and Calvinists,[22] as a way to counter Habsburg attempts at supremacy in Europe.[22]
