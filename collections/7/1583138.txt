In violation of an arms embargo, officials of President Ronald Reagan's administration officials arranged in the mid-1980s to sell armaments to Iran in an attempt to improve relations with Iran and obtain their influence in the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Oliver North of the National Security Council then diverted proceeds from the arms sale to fund Contra rebels attempting to overthrow the left wing government of Nicaragua, which was in direct violation of the United States Congress' Boland Amendment.[78][79] In November 1986, Reagan issued a televised statement that the arms sales did not occur.[80] One week later, he confirmed that weapons had been transferred to Iran, but denied that they were part of an exchange for hostages.[79] A later investigation noted that documents relating to the affair were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials.[81]
