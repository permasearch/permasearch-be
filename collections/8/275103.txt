In 2011, Claflin started dating actress Laura Haddock.[21] In a 2012 interview, he said of Haddock, "She's my female counterpart is the best way to describe her. She is my mum. She reminds me of my mum so much which I think - a guy will know, right? It's important. Your mum knows like everything." Claflin states that, after he first met her, he called his agent to exclaim that he had just met the woman he wanted to marry. The two married in July 2013 in a private ceremony.[22][23] They live in Chiswick, London.[24] Haddock gave birth to their first child, a son, on 10 December 2015.[25]
