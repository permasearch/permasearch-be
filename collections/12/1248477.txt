Conspirators were caught in a plot to assassinate Pharaoh Ramesses III around 1151 B.C.E.. Papyrus trial transcripts reveal the method of execution, which may have been being buried alive. Although not common practice, it is possible that a fictional priest such as Imhotep would be punished this way.[17]
