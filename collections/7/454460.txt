Geoff Johns confirmed that the film had ended principal photography on August 6, 2010 and entered post-production.[54] In an interview with MTV News, director Martin Campbell was asked about the film's effects-heavy epic scale and commented "It's daunting, just the process, (there are) something like 1,300 visual shots, it's mind-blowing, quite honestly".[55] When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated "One of the nice things is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, what are we going to do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs".[56] The studio also confirmed that the film would have a 3-D release.[57]
