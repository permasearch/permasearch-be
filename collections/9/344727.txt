Though both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilised less action from the private sector.[41] A 2014 report by the OECD found that just 16 percent of global finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2014.[45] The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically underscoring the need to increase adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector.[41] John Kerry, as Secretary of State, announced that the U.S. would double its grant-based adaptation finance by 2020.[28]
