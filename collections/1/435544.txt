As is shown in Secrets of the Furious Five, Great Master Viper was shocked when Viper was born without fangs, prompting him to not pay her much attention as she grew up since he thought there was no point teaching her kung fu if she couldn't use "Poison Fang". Consequently, Viper instead took up ribbon dancing to cheer her father up. She finally got her chance to prove herself when a ferocious gorilla bandit took the precaution of wearing armour and broke Great Master Viper's fangs, with Viper then tying the bandit up with her ribbon and saving her father's life.
