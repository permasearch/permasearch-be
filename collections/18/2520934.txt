In mid-February, the prime minister, David Cameron, and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, made opposing speeches advocating a 'No' and 'Yes' result respectively. Clegg argued that AV would mean "fairer votes" and that FPTP produced more safe seats, and linked these to the MPs' expenses scandal. He said that AV would encourage politicians to work to appeal to more of the electorate rather than just their core supporters.[147] He stated that "I think this [AV] is a natural evolution which reflects the fact that politics is no longer now, as it was 50Â years ago when everybody was very happy to plump for the blue corner or the red corner, people want more choice now."
