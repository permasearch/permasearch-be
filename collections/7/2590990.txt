On May 29, Kemp injured his right hamstring in a game. He left during the seventh inning, and did not return to the game.[87] Kemp was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 30.[88] He spent time rehabbing at Camelback Ranch, the Dodgers spring training home, and was close to returning when he suffered a setback on June 9.[89] Kemp returned to the Dodgers on June 25, after missing 24 games. In that game, Kemp made a game-ending catch while reaching over his shoulder, robbing the Giants' Marco Scutaro of a hit.[90]
