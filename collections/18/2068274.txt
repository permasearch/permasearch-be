Escobedo appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which initially held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction.[2] Illinois petitioned for rehearing and the court then affirmed the conviction. Escobedo appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.[3] The ACLU argued before the Court as amicus curiae favoring Escobedo in a 5-4 decision.[4][5]
