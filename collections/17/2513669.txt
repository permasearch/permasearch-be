The Mexican Mafia was formed in 1957 by 13 Hispanic street gang members from different Los Angeles neighborhoods that were all incarcerated at the Deuel Vocational Institution, a California Youth Authority facility, which is now an adult state prison in Tracy, California.[16][5] They formed in order to protect themselves from other prison gangs at the time.[4][17] One of the founders of La eMe is Luis "Huero Buff" Flores who was an active member of the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang in Hawaiian Gardens, California. Gang warfare between Hispanic neighborhoods was the norm during the 1950s and 60s so the fact that Luis Flores was able to get established enemies to set aside their rivalries upon entry into the prison system was something that was not thought possible. This requirement exists to the present day. Hispanic street gangs like White Fence, The Avenues, Clanton 14, San Fer, Varrio Nuevo Estrada, and the oldest most prominent of them all, Primera Flats,[18] were already into their second decade and firmly established as self-sustaining entities.[3]
