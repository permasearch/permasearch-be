The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 157Â million years ago,[1] making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 327 known species alive today, some are highly endangered.[6][7]
