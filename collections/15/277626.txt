E. Reagan of The TV Chick gave the episode an A rating saying that it was a great finale and set up for the next season. "The last few episodes have been stellar for sure. [...] There were some great moments in this episode that tugged the heart strings: Stefanâ€™s sacrifice for his brother (a little questionable though), Caroline and her mom, Bonnie and Jeremy, Alaric as a caregiver, everything Elena and Damon. Really good stuff."[4]
