B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine encoded by the TNFSF13B gene. A variant of the gene containing a deletion (GCTGTâ€”>A) renders a shorter mRNA transcript that escapes degradation by microRNA, thus increasing expression of BAFF, which consequently up-regulates the humoral immune response. This variant is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, but heterozygote carriers of the variant have decreased susceptibility to malaria infection[19]
