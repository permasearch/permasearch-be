Black women in Canada established a national women’s organization in the post-war years, with the founding of the Canadian Negro Women’s Association in 1951. Though the organization started largely as a social organization, over several decades, it became more activist in orientation, and in 1980, after a national conference, it changed its name to the Congress of Black Women to reflect the changing structures and concerns of the organization.[67][68]
