Kroll and Mulaney have appeared in character on an episode of Conan O'Brien's TBS talk-show Conan. The appearance occurred during O'Brien's week of shows taped from the Apollo Theater in New York City, which coincided with the run of Oh, Hello on Broadway. George and Gil appeared during the monologue to give O'Brien a "welcome-back-to-New York-official-basket", consisting of a pre-broken umbrella, a sun-faded photo of Danny Aiello, a cup of three-week old watermelon, a copy of Fagen's New York, and a gift certificate to St Michael's Cemetery.
