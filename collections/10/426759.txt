There are two distinct and rich architectural traditions in Andhra Pradesh. The first traces back to the building of the city of Amaravathi under Satavahanas. This unique style of architecture emphasises the use of intricate and abstract sculpture with inspiration from religious themes. The second tradition draws on the enormous granite and lime stone reserves of the region and is reflected in the various temples and forts built over a very long period of time.
