Originally a lower-middle-class Southern and a thriving Jewish neighborhood in the 1930s.[6][7] The name "Little Havana" emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply.  Little Havana is the name affixed to a sprawling neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami.  It stretches west from the Miami River for several miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community.[1]
