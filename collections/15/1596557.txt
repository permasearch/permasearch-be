These lobbying efforts triggered the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations of 17 December 1942 which made public and condemned the mass extermination of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland. The statement was read to British House of Commons in a floor speech by Foreign secretary Anthony Eden, and published on the front page of the New York Times and many other newspapers.[10] BBC radio aired two broadcasts on the final solution during the war: the first at 9Â am on 17 December 1942, on the UN Joint Declaration, read by Polish Foreign Minister in-exile Edward Raczynski, and the second during May 1943, Jan Karski's eye witness account of mass Jewish executions, read by Arthur Koestler.[11] However, the political rhetoric and public reporting was not followed up with military action by the British Government- an omission that has been the source of significant historical debate.
