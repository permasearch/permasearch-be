Today was a two-hour program for many years, airing from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. in all time zones except for Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, until NBC expanded the program to three hours (extending the program until 10:00 a.m.) on October 2, 2000. A fourth hour (which extended the program until 11:00 a.m.) was eventually added on September 10, 2007. NBC stations in some markets air the third and fourth hours of Today on tape delay. WHDH in Boston, Massachusetts was an NBC station that would follow this practice to accommodate an hour of local news at 9:00 am. On January 1, 2017, the NBC affiliation in Boston moved to a new owned-and-operated station, WBTS, which airs the third and fourth hours of Today at its regular 9:00 am and 10:00 am timeslots.
