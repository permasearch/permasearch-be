The Discovery Sport will initially be sold with alloy wheels ranging from 18 inches (460 mm) to 20 inches (510 mm) in diameter. Various emergency spare wheels options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size spare wheel mounted internally under the floor of the trunk,[9] or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' spare wheel mounted on the underside of the car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a spare wheel on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a tyre repair system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.
