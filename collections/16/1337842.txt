Born the middle child of three sisters, Eckford grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and attended a private Christian high school. She attended music school in Sydney, Australia.[10] Ruelle is now professionally based out of Nashville, Tennessee.[1] Eckford adopted the French word "Ruelle" as her stage name because she liked how it gave off a sense of darkness and mystery and how it had multiple meanings including "chamber" and "wolf".[10]
