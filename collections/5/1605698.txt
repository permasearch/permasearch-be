Donald is also a bit of a show-off. He likes to brag, especially about how skilled he is at something. He does, in fact, have many skillsâ€”he is something of a Jack of all Trades. Amongst other things, he is a good fisher and a good hockey player. However, his love of bragging often leads him to overestimate his abilities, so that when he sets out to make good on his boasts, he gets in over his head, usually to hilarious effect.
