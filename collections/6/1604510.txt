Note before 1981, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) was the sole governing body for women's intercollegiate athletics and sponsored national championships in women's sports. Starting in 1981, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) began to sponsor women's athletic championships as well as those for men's sports. During the 1981–82 school year, the AIAW and NCAA both sponsored championships in several women's sports. Starting in 1982–83, the NCAA became the sole sponsor of women's intercollegiate sports championships and national championships in those sports.
