In "Liabilities", Granger is confirmed to have passed away; after leaving the hospital in "Old Tricks", he went to the safe house his daughter resided in and spent his last week with her, trying to make up for his failure to be a father to her.  One morning, Jennifer found him dead under a tree overlooking a valley and buried him there.
