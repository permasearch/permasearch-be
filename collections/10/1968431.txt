When Volvo manufactured its first automobiles in 1927, the first truck was already on the drawing table. In early 1928, the LV series 1 was presented to the public. Though by modern standards it was merely a truck, it was an immediate success and 500 units were sold before the summer. It had a 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine rated at 28 hp (21 kW).[4]
