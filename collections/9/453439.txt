The song was used for the theme song to the NBC television series The Yellow Rose, starring Cybill Shepherd.[2] While the television show used only the song's first verse and chorus, the commercial single version included a second verse not heard on the program,[3] with Lee's "Say When" on the B-side. Brody and Lee would later chart a second duet, "I Could Get Used to This," in 1986, although it was never included on an album.[1]
