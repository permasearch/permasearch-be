It provides for the operation of a National Disaster Medical System, which is a coordinated effort to provide health and auxiliary services to respond to the needs of victims of a public health emergency or be present at locations that DHHS has determined is at risk of a public health emergency.

The NDMS now has over 5,000 civilian volunteers and 1,800 participating hospitals. 55 of the 80 NFMS groups are Disaster Medical Assistance Teams, which respond to public health emergencies in the US and internationally. 10 are Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams, which are responsible for identification and handling of human remains in mass-casualty situations.
