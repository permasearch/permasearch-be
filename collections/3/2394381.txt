In 1914, in one of the many Manhattan properties Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street in Greenwich Village, next to her own MacDougal Alley studio.[5]  The club was intended as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works.  When the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected her offer in 1929 of a gift of new artworks, Whitney established the Whitney Museum of American Art, and in 1931 had architect Auguste L. Noel convert the three row houses at 8-12 West 8th Street into the museum's first home, as well as a residence for Whitney.[5]  In 1954, the museum moved uptown to new quarters, and the buildings, with the addition of #14, became the New York Studio School.[5]
