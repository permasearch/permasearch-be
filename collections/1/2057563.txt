The song was originally recorded and released by Bruce Dickinson for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,[3][4] but Steve Harris liked it so Iron Maiden rerecorded it.[5] It is the only UK No.Â 1 single for the band to date,[6] in spite of the fact that it received very little airplay on the BBC.
