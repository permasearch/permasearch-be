In 2017, Notre Dame traveled to East Lansing to take on the Spartans once again. Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush threw for a touchdown and ran for another as Notre Dame routed Michigan State 38–18.[8][9] Notre Dame's defense forced three turnovers in the game, including an interception return for a touchdown by Irish defensive back Julian Love on MSU's first possession, which gave the Irish an early 14–0 lead.
