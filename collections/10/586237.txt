PV systems have the major disadvantage that the power output is dependent on direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used, since the cell will not be directly facing the sun at all times.[2] Dust, clouds, and other things in the atmosphere also diminish the power output.[3][4] Another main issue is the concentration of the production in the hours corresponding to main insolation, which do not usually match the peaks in demand in human activity cycles.[1] Unless current societal patterns of consumption and electrical networks mutually adjust to this scenario, electricity still needs to be stored for later use or made up by other power sources, usually hydrocarbon.
