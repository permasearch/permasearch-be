AJ's rejection of Bryan turned him into an angry and bitter individual and resulted in Bryan lashing out at audiences.[168] AJ continued to exact her revenge on Bryan by denying him a WWE Championship shot and instead forcing him to face Kane on August 19 at SummerSlam,[169] where Bryan emerged victorious.[170] As a result of Bryan and Kane's issues, AJ enrolled them in anger management classes hosted by Dr. Shelby[171] and they were later forced to "hug it out".[172] At the arrangement of Dr. Shelby and AJ, the two adversaries formed a team whose constant bickering and infighting even during matches inadvertently resulted in them defeating The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) to become the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the September 10 episode of Raw[173] and then defeating champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth to win the championship on September 16 at Night of Champions.[174]
