The first seaplane, the French Fabre Hydravion, was flown in 1910, and the first seaplane carrier, Foudre, was christened in the following year.[8] Despite that innovation, the general development of the French Navy slowed down in the beginning of the 20th century as the naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain grew in intensity. It entered World War I with relatively few modern vessels, and during the war few warships were built because the main French effort was on land. While the British held control of the North Sea, the French held the Mediterranean, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy.[5] The largest operations of the Navy were conducted during the Dardanelles Campaign.[5] In December 1916, French warships bombarded Athens, forcing the pro-German government of Greece to change its policies.[9] The French Navy also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.[5]
