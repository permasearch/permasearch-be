Tyler arrives to the Gilbert house to get the box with the donated items his mother needs for the Founder's Ball. Elena gives it to him but later, Mrs Lockwood calls to tell Elena that the pocket watch was not among the items. Elena says she will look for it and bring it to the Ball. She goes to Jeremy's room and accuses him of stealing it. Jeremy denies that he took it but he eventually gives it back to Elena telling her that he only took it because their father was going to give it to him. Feeling badly, Elena decides to return the watch to Jeremy before she leaves for the Ball.
