These visual illusions include balls rolling uphill and people leaning farther than normally possible without falling down.[11] Psychologists at Berkeley state that all of the misperceptions stem from the simple fact that the house is slanted at a 20 degree angle.[12] Professor William Prinzmetal states, “When the perceiver's body also is tilted, the distorting impact on vision is greatly magnified- up to two or three times.”[13] Another point he makes is that distorted orientation causes other senses to fall back while your visual senses become heightened.[14] People standing at impossible angles and water flowing uphill are related to the angle at which the house sits on.
