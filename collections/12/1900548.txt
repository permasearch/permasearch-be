Therefore, a rough estimate is that RMS can meet all of the deadlines if CPU utilization is less than 69.32%. The other 30.7% of the CPU can be dedicated to lower-priority non real-time tasks. It is known that a randomly generated periodic task system will meet all deadlines when the utilization is 85% or less,[3] however this fact depends on knowing the exact task statistics (periods, deadlines) which cannot be guaranteed for all task sets.
