7. Gideon Gordon Graves is the seventh evil ex, the series' main antagonist and the leader of the League of Ramona's Evil Exes and suggested to be Ramona's boyfriend previous to Scott in New York City. He is mentioned several times throughout the series, but never seen fully until the end of Volume 3. He is the owner of the "Chaos Theatre" (a reference to EarthBound), in NYC and "GGG Heavy Industries," which is opening "Chaos Theatre Toronto". Ramona has also "worked" for him previously in an unknown capacity, eventually he makes contact with Scott. There is also a small cat living at Ramona's house by the same name, though the cat is revealed to only be named as such by Ramona as a way of dealing with the breakup. Gideon finally appears in the last volume as an inventor and club entrepreneur who is opening a new club, the Chaos Theatre, in Toronto. He begins a relationship with Envy, promoting her new solo album and setting her debut up as his club's opening act. During this time, he meets up with Scott, who flees instead of fighting him, though their altercation is unavoidably inevitable. He has apparent control over subspace, a side effect of his ability to induce "emotional warfare" via The Glow, which essentially traps people in their minds with their psychological issues. Using this allows him to literally be inside Ramona's head. He is also able to steal Scott's Power of Love katana and proves to be a competent swordsman. Upon his defeat, he showers $7,777,777 (once more, in coins) over the Chaos Theatre. Gideon is played by Jason Schwartzman in the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, who also controls Ramona's head through the use of microchips. One of the ten secrets for Gideon was that "Gideon is very passive aggressive and so he’s not overtly evil. He smiles a lot, just kind of 'kill ‘em with kindness,' but you can feel that it’s not sincere almost instantly." Schwartzman also stated that he really liked learning about this aspect of the character.[9]
