Sometimes, a Hasidic gathering similar to a tish is conducted without the presence of a Rebbe. This is called a botteh (באטע‬) in Yiddish or a shevet achim (שבת אחים‬) in Hebrew. It is often led by a Rabbi who is not a Rebbe, such as a Rosh Yeshivah, Mashgiach Ruchani, or a Rebbe's son. Often, a botteh will be indistinguishable from a tish, for the respect that many Hasidim have for their Rebbe's son is often very close to the reverence for the Rebbe himself, as he is the assumed heir to the throne.
