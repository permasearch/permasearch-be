Simpson released her second studio album, I Am Me, in October 2005. The album featured similar pop-rock themes as found on her debut effort, though Simpson hoped to incorporate the feel of music from the 1980s into her sound.[41] Much like her previous release, Simpson co-wrote all of the songs on the album. It became her second album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 220,000 copies in the United States.[42] The album failed to match the success of Autobiography, though it went on to sell over three million copies worldwide.[14] The album's lead single, "Boyfriend," was written and composed about the rumors between Simpson and Valderama, and it became her second top twenty hit in the United States.[43] For the release of the album, Simpson went back to her blonde hair.[14] The album's second and final single, "L.O.V.E.," entered the top forty in the United States.[43] Simpson appeared for a second time as a musical performer on Saturday Night Live, performing the song "Catch Me When I Fall," which was inspired by her previous appearance on the series, as well as "Boyfriend." This time, both songs were performed without any adverse incident.[14] In mid-December, Simpson collapsed after performing in Japan, and was briefly hospitalized, consequently cancelling an appearance at the Radio Music Awards. The collapse and her subsequent hospitalization were attributed to exhaustion as a result of her busy work schedule.[44]
