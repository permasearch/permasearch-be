A regular passenger train operating between Maradana and Matara was derailed and overturned by the tsunami which took at least 1,700 lives, making it the largest single rail disaster in world history by death toll.[72] Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami 7.5–9 m (24.6 ft to 29.5 ft) above sea level and 2–3 m (6.6 ft to 9.8 ft) higher than the top of the train.
