Although Pan Am continued to use its political influence to lobby for protection of its position as America's primary international airline, it encountered increasing competition â€” first from American Export Airlines (American Overseas Airlines (AOA) from November 1945[45]) across the Atlantic to Europe, and subsequently from others including TWA to Europe, Braniff to South America, United to Hawaii and Northwest Orient to East Asia, as well as five potential rivals to Mexico. This changed situation resulted from the new post-war approach the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) took towards the promotion of competition between major U.S. carriers on key domestic and international scheduled routes compared with pre-war U.S. aviation policy.[46][44][47]
