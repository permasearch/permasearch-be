During 1898â€“1906 the federal government dissolved the former Cherokee Nation, to make way for the incorporation of Indian Territory into the new state of Oklahoma. From 1906 to 1975, the structure and function of the tribal government were defunct, except for the purposes of DoI management. In 1975 the tribe drafted a constitution, which they ratified on June 26, 1976,[76] and the tribe received federal recognition. In 1999, the CN changed or added several provisions to its constitution, among them the designation of the tribe to be "Cherokee Nation," dropping "of Oklahoma." According to a statement by BIA head Larry Echo Hawk the Cherokee Nation is not the historical Cherokee tribe but instead a "successor in interest."  The attorney of the Cherokee Nation has stated that they intend to appeal this decision.[77]
