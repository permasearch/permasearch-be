Costa's singing voice is a combination of classical and pop singing.[19] Aurora's songs were recorded within the first year of production.[16] Costa would practice her songs live with the orchestra before recording them.[16] After working on the film for three years,[16] Costa finally finished recording in 1955,[19] long before the film was completed; it would take the animators another several years to complete the footage to accompany Costa's vocals and dialogue.[8] Costa would often return to the studio to re-record lines as the story changed and evolved,[19] which she described as a "painstaking" process.[16] However, with only 18 spoken lines, Aurora speaks less than any other main character in a full-length Disney animated feature – aside from Dumbo, who is completely silent –[22] and has absolutely no dialogue once she is awoken from her deep sleep.[8] The character's lack of dialogue is attributed to the fact that she remains asleep for the majority of the film.[23] Ultimately, Costa's performance in Sleeping Beauty – and Walt Disney himself – inspired her to pursue a full-time career as a professional opera singer.[5] Costa's salary was $250 per week.[24]
