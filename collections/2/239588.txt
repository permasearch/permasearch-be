The Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas was the most visible failure as it topped out the tallest building in Las Vegas before going bankrupt. Initial offers for selling the uncompleted tower are far less than the raw land value from two years ago. The Echelon also got as far as erecting steel girders up as high as the eighth floor for several buildings. The owners, Boyd Gaming sold the property to the Malaysian company Genting. They plan on opening Resorts World Hotel and Casino in 2018. The style will be Chinese themed.
