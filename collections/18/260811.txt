The flooding as such was foreseeable, its exact dates and levels could only be forecast on a short term basis by transmitting the gauge readings at Aswan to the lower parts of the kingdom where  the data had to be converted to the local circumstances. Which was not foreseeable, of course, was the size of flooding and its total discharge.
