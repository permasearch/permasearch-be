After the conflict officially ended in April 30th, 1975 with the fall of Saigon, government officials were sent from the North to take over the old regime. However, without financial support from the US to the South, and the North already received heavy lost after the war, the newly united Vietnam was in serious condition both economically and socially. Gabriel García Márquez, a Nobel Prize winner journalist, described South Vietnam as a “False paradise” after the war, when he visited this country in 1980: “The cost of this delirium was stupefying: 360,000 people mutilated, a million widows, 500,000 prostitutes, 500,000 drug addicts, a million tuberculars and more than a million soldiers of the old regime, impossible to completely rehabilitate into a new society. Ten percent of the population of Ho Chi Minh City was suffering from serious venereal diseases when the war ended, and there were 4 million illiterates throughout the South.”[322]
