Over the course of the game, Kyle is joined by various other characters. Three of the most prominent are Jan Ors (Vanessa Marshall[19]), a fellow mercenary and subsequent love interest; Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams[19]), the sophisticated administrator of Cloud City, as seen in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi; and Luke Skywalker (Bob Bergen[19]), leader of the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. The player also receives help from other Jedi and New Republic soldiers,[20] while Mon Mothma (Carolyn Seymour[19]), Chief-of-State of the New Republic, assigns Kyle and Jan missions during the game.[21]
