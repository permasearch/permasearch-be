In modern-day China, Vladivostok is officially known by the transliteration Fúlādíwòsītuōkè (符拉迪沃斯托克), although the historical Chinese name Haishenwai is still often used in common parlance and outside mainland China to refer to the city.[13][14] According to the provisions of the Chinese government, all maps published in China have to bracket the city's Chinese name.[15]
