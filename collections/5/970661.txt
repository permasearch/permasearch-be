Entertainment Weekly rated the episode "C", in its review of the fifth season.[10] It cited Chandler's line "You've got to push past this, okay? Because it's about to get sooo good" as the best of the episode.[10] The review criticized the manner in which an employee can feel pressured into smoking, adding it is "not exactly the stuff that laughs are made of". Moreover, it argued the same over the competitive vibe between Joey and Ross.[10] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide added in a review of the fifth season DVD: "Although I don't like the cutesy kid who plays Ben, the audition bits become funny due to Joey’s screw-ups. His inability to correctly read the line "mmm – soup!" becomes very amusing and offers the show's highlights."[11]
