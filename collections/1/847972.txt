Pointy ears are a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as the French croquemitaine, Brazilian curupira[46] or Japanese earth spider.[47] It has been a feature of characters on art as old as that of Ancient Greece[48] and medieval Europe.[49] Pointy ears are a common characteristic of many creatures in the fantasy genre,[50] including elves,[51][52][53] faeries,[54][55] pixies,[56] hobbits,[57] or orcs.[58] They are a characteristic of creatures in the horror genre, such as vampires.[59][60] Pointy ears are also found in the science fiction genre; for example among the Vulcan and Romulan races of the Star Trek universe[61] and the Nightcrawler character from the X-Men universe.[62]
