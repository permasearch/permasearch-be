The North East Line (NEL) Contract 705 for the design and construction of Potong Pasir and Boon Keng stations and associated tunnels was awarded to the joint venture of Kumagai Gumi, Sembawang Engineering & Construction and Mitsui & Corporation on 23 June 1997 for $316.7 million. To facilitate the construction of the station, a part of Bendemeer Shopping Mall was demolished to make way for the construction of this station. The remaining portion of the building continues to be used for retail purposes today.
