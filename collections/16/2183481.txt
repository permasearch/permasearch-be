In 2014, the Art Happening was established to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater. Inspired by the 'Art Hive' movement in Montreal, the group of motivated and enthusiastic community members developed the idea of a free/low cost art building focused on creativity for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms.
