Through the course of the series, the chimpanzee Caesar becomes leader of the apes, and attempts to change the timeline that led to the world abandoned by his parents, Zira and Cornelius, who travelled to Earth's past. By the time the Lawgiver appears in Battle, the children he addresses (as he tells them about Caesar) are a mix of both humans and apes. However, in the book Planet of the Apes Revisited, the original screenwriter, Paul Dehn, stated that the tear on the statue of Caesar at the end of the film is meant as an indication to the audience that Caesar's efforts ultimately failed. Roddy McDowall conversely asserts (in Behind the Planet of the Apes, a 1998 documentary made for the thirtieth anniversary of the original film), that the tear was meant to be totally ambiguous, leaving it up to audience members to decide for themselves whether or not Caesar had succeeded in altering the future.
