Evans finished second on stage one of the Tour de France, and won stage 4, the third Tour de France stage win of his career.[23] Evans then led the mountains classification after stage 4 for a single day. As the tour continued Evans was looked upon often to chase down breakaways in order to preserve his position in the top 5 of the general classification (GC) and in order to maintain time gaps that he believed he could strategically make up in the individual time trial of stage 20.[24] During stage 19 of the Tour, Evans was forced to chase an early breakaway containing the GC contenders and led by three-time champion Alberto Contador. However, he experienced mechanical trouble and was forced to change bikes. He again led the peloton to pull back the contender group, keeping himself within striking distance for overall victory by remaining just under a minute behind Andy Schleck.
