Figured bass is a notation convention that specifies chord inversion with Arabic numerals (figures), placed vertically, in descending numerical order) above the bass note of each chord in performing notation (or below the note in analytical indications), indicating a harmonic progression. Each numeral expresses the interval that results from the voices above it (usually assuming octave equivalence).
