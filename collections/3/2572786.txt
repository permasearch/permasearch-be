An accompanying music video was shot by British director Sophie Muller, which featured Minogue dancing and singing in several backdrops that were inspired by the Country and Western culture, such as the work of Dolly Parton, and death. The video received positive remarks, who praised the aesthetic and Minogue's image re-invention. To promote the single, Minogue performed the song on the Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway show, Sport Relief and the annual Echo Music Prize awards in Germany. Furthermore, the track appeared on the setlist of her promo tour Kylie Presents Golden.
