Two blood group systems were discovered by Karl Landsteiner during early experiments with blood transfusion: the ABO group in 1901[35][full citation needed] and in co-operation with Alexander S. Wiener the Rhesus group in 1937.[36][37] Development of the Coombs test in 1945,[38] the advent of transfusion medicine, and the understanding of ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups, and now 33 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT),[3] and in the 33 blood groups, over 600 blood group antigens have been found;[4] many of these are rare or are mainly found in certain ethnic groups.
