C. maenas has the ability to disperse by a variety of mechanisms,[21] including ballast water, ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, migration of crab larvae on ocean currents, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher et al.[14] found C. maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.
