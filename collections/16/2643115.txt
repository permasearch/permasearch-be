In January 2009, McCormack returned to television in the TNT drama Trust Me, co-starring Tom Cavanagh. The series, set around a fictional advertising firm, starred McCormack as Mason McGuire, the firm's newly promoted creative director, and deals with his best friend's (Cavanagh) unpredictable behavior.[50] In an interview with USA Weekend, McCormack revealed he was not afraid of being typecast.[51] McCormack's decision to do the show was due to "great writing".[52] The show debuted on January 26, 2009, and was watched by almost 3.4Â million viewers.[53] Trust Me debuted to very positive reviews, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle writing, "...the series is surprisingly solid."[54] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that McCormack and Cavanagh "manage to keep their characters sharply defined but low-key. They are opposites but not in an ash-smudged, Windex-wielding Felix and Oscar way."[55] The series, however, was cancelled after one season, due to poor ratings.[56][57]
