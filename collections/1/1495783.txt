In 2003, author Grace Livingstone described Colombian paramilitaries as "various types of illegal rightwing armed groups which work alongside the armed forces. They include private militia funded by landowners and business; drug traffickers' hit squads and 'social cleansing' death squads. The largest paramilitary network is the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC)."[81] Paramilitaries were considered responsible for three quarters of all Colombian political killings between 1995 and 2001,[80][Note 8] 52% of the massacres in 1998 (guerrillas were responsible for 20%),[83] and 49% of the refugee displacements in 1999 (guerrillas are responsible for 29%).[84] In 2003, The Guardian's columnist George Monbiot stated that "over the past 10 years, the paramilitaries [which the Colombian army] works with have killed some 15,000 trades unionists, peasant and indigenous leaders, human rights workers, land reform activists, leftwing politicians and their sympathizers."[85]
