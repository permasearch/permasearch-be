In 1965, International Harvester introduced the follow on to the 70/100, with the 71/102 as well as the new 122. The Cub Cadet 71 was the replacement for the 70 and kept many of the same features as the 70 including the pan seat, optional round fenders, and 7 hp Kohler engine.  The model 102 directly replaced the 100.  The new 122 was the first model with the 12 hp Kohler K301 engine. The Cub Cadet 102 and 122 retained the same frame as the models 70 and 100, but they were the first models to come standard with square fenders. During the production run in 1966, International introduced the model 123.  The model 123 was the same as the model 122, except the three speed gear driven transmission was replaced by a shaft driven hydrostatic transmission.  The Sunstrand 15U hydrostatic transmission allowed the operator to have complete control over their speed eliminating the requirement to clutch and choose gears.  Because International thought people would be skeptical of the reliability of a hydrostatic transmission, they painted a few 123s as tigers and put them in circus acts in which operators would perform tricks on them jamming it in reverse and forward to prove the durability of the new transmission.
