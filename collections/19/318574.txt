Batch production is the method used to produce or process any product in groups or batches where the products in the batch go through the whole production process together. An example would be when a bakery produces each different type of bread separately and each product(in this case, bread) is not produced continuously. Batch production is used in many different ways and is most suited to when there is a need for a quality/quantity balance. This technique is probably the most commonly used method for organizing manufacture and promotes specialist labor, as very often batch production involves a small number of persons. Batch production occurs when many similar items are produced together. Each batch goes through one stage of the production before moving onto next stage.
