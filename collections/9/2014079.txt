Tita was born on a kitchen table and spent most of her time with Nacha. She knew the smells of the kitchen and learned how to cook at a young age. In the kitchen Tita is able to connect with Pedro. She states that when she puts all of her passion into her food, and after Pedro eats it, it is like she is entering his body in a sexual way. That has always been how the two connected. They did not need to touch physically, as Tita is an expert in the kitchen and able to make others feel what she feels when she prepares food.
