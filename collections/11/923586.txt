Although produced in 1986 as the fourth film, Guinea Pig 4: Devil Woman Doctor (ギニーピッグ4 ピーターの悪魔の女医さん, Ginī Piggu 4: Pītā no Akuma no Joi-san) was the sixth to be released, telling the story of a female doctor (sometimes appearing incognito as her cleaner), played by Japanese drag actor Peter. The film takes the form of several 'sketches' in which she treats her patients (often mutilating, killing or introducing them to novelty show acting careers in the process). It was directed by Hajime Tabe and this episode shifted the tone of the series from graphic horror to extremely violent slapstick comedy.
