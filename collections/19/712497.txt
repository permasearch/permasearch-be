The argument implies an adherence to the humanist idea of the greater purity of the classics,[48] which particularly in Renaissance times led people to regard aspects of English that differed from Latin as inferior. However, by the 19th century such views were no longer widespread; Moriarty is in error about the age of the prohibition. It has also been stated that an argument from Latin would be fallacious because "there is no precedent in these languages for condemning the split infinitive because in Greek and Latin (and all the other romance languages) the infinitive is a single word that is impossible to sever".[49]
