Sea water is hypertonic relative to blood, so water diffuses from blood into the water in the alveoli, and the electrolytes diffuse into the blood, leading to hypovolemia, haemoconcentration and hypernatremia. The laboratory blood tests may show these shifts, which may be diagnostically useful.[24] In animal experiments the thicker blood requires more work from the heart leading to cardiac arrest in 8 to 10 minutes.[citation needed]
