The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in the world by number of stations, with 472 stations in operation[16] (424 if stations connected by transfers are counted as single stations).[1] Stations are located throughout the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The Staten Island Railway is not officially considered part of the subway, as it lacks a rail link with the subway system, so passengers traveling to another borough take a ferry or bus; however, free transfers are allowed to the New York City Subway and the MTA's bus system.[16] The Port Authority Trans-Hudson in Manhattan and New Jersey[17] and the AirTrain JFK in Queens[18] both accept the subway's MetroCard but are not operated by the MTA and do not allow free transfers.[19] However, the Roosevelt Island Tramway does allow free transfers to the MTA and bus systems, even though it is also not operated by the MTA.[19]
