The Mexico national team has competed in the tournament since the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup, and has entered ever since, for a total of 16 tournaments, although it has failed to qualify for the finals proper on 3 occasions: 1934 (Italy), 1974 (West Germany), and 1982 (Spain). In addition, it withdrew from the finals in 1938 (France), and was banned by FIFA from entering the 1990 World Cup (Italy) after fielding over-aged players during the 1988 Olympic Games qualifiers, which was a youth tournament.
