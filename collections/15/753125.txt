St George's Chapel in Windsor is the mother church of the Order of the Garter. Special service are held annually in June. The Order of the Garter once held services at the chapel, but they became rare in the 18th century.[citation needed] The annual Garter Services, discontinued in 1805, were revived by King George VI in 1948 and have become an annual event.[citation needed]
