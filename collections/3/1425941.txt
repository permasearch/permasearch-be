While employed as a supervisor at an adventure playground, she observed a man making canoes nearby and, because he was married, put off talking to him; it was a year before he asked her for a date.[7] It was at a canoeing course she met her future second husband, Colin Broadway, who was the father of her fourth child, Elizabeth.[2] Subsequently, she became pregnant twice more, but underwent abortions. Ultimately, Townsend came to believe that termination is wrong. Ghost Children (1997) is a novel which draws on these experiences.[5]
