In the 1990s, some corporations (IBM,[54] GE,[55] and Verizon Communications) were known to include pension fund earnings as the basis of bonuses when the actual corporate earnings are negative, and discontinuing the practice when the bull market ended and these earnings turned to losses.[56] In one notable case of executive bonus justification, Verizon Communications not only used $1.8 billion of pension income to turn a corporate loss into a $289 million profit, but created the $1.8 billion income from a $3.1 billion loss by projecting (optimistic) future returns of 9.25 percent on pension assets.[57][58]
