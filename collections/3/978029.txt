Upon Lane's departure from Rocky Ridge Farm, her parents moved back into the farmhouse they had built, which had most recently been occupied by friends.[24]  From 1935 on, they were alone at Rocky Ridge Farm. Most of the surrounding area (including the property with the stone cottage Lane had built for them) was sold, but they still kept some farm animals, and tended their flower beds and vegetable gardens. Almost daily, carloads of fans stopped by, eager to meet "Laura" of the Little House books.
