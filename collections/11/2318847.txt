Another paper relocation took place after the league's 2017 season. FC Kansas City, based in the Missouri city, folded at the end of that season, and was immediately replaced by a new team owned by MLS club Real Salt Lake, which would soon be unveiled as Utah Royals FC. While the Royals are officially treated as a separate entity from FC Kansas City, they acquired all of FC Kansas City's then-current player contracts shortly after their establishment.
