"Big Boy", which was uncovered from the Great Mortuary of Craig Mound at Spiro,[59] is a large effigy pipe weighing 11Â lbs., 8 oz., probably made of bauxite.[60] It is likely that it was originally a sculpture that was only later converted into a pipe bowl.[61] This remarkable artifact was first illustrated in 1952.[62] The figure is nude, with his hair arranged in an occipital bun and a long braid hanging over his left shoulder. His only body clothing is a cape draped over his back. The cape has a "spade" or feather design, leading most archaeologists to conclude that it was a feather cape, a mantle well known from many Native American cultures in historical times.[63] However, it seems unlikely that it actually is a feather cape.
