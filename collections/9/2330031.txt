While the College has traditionally focused on a service area within six miles, increasing numbers of students from outside that area call SCC "their" community college. With a student population that closely mirrors the diversity of SCC's service area, the College attracts students from 100 different countries. On campus walkways, one sees people of all ages and numerous cultural backgrounds.
