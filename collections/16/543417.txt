Lead has many uses in the construction industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets.[189][190] Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures,[p] including for armatures.[192] In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favor of other materials.[96]
