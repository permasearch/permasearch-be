After Bach's death the cantatas fell into obscurity even more than his oratorios. There is some evidence for the chorale cantatas being performed at Leipzig after Bach's death, but the cantatas were little known until a society called the Bach-Gesellschaft began to publish the composer's complete works starting in 1851. Only one of the cantatas, Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, had been published during Bach's lifetime. The cantata Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV1, was selected as the first work to appear in the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe, the first complete edition.[32]
