If I got to choose a coast, I got to choose the East I live out there, so don't go there But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West See some nice breasts in the West Smoke some nice sess in the West Y'all niggas is a mess Thinkin' I'm gon' stop givin' L.A. props All I got is beef with those that violate me I shall annihilate thee
