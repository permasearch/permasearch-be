A ratings hit, Season 1 premiered on January 10, 2001 and aired its finale on February 28, 2001. The show was controversial from the get-go, something that Fox hoped would drive ratings. Four male contestants lived in one section with a dozen female models, and the four female contestants lived in another section with a dozen attractive men. The initial couples were Kaya Wittenburg and Valerie Penso, Mandy Lauderdale and Billy Cleary, Ytossie Patterson and Taheed Watson, and Andy Lukei and Shannon Roghair. Patterson and Watson were removed from the show when the producers learned that the pair had children together. The remaining three couples continued. Season 2 premiered on October 31, 2001 and delivered poor ratings.[1] After a nearly two-year layoff, a third edition of the series premiered on August 28, 2003. Like Season 2, Season 3 also delivered poor ratings.[2]
