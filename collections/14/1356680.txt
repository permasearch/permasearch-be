In Argentina, the Sierra was offered as a five-door hatchback beginning in the summer of 1984.[28] A station wagon body style was added in September 1985.[29] The sporting XR4, with three-door bodywork arrived a couple of months after the original introduction. The face-lifted post-1987 model did not reach the Argentinian market, where the range continued with a Merkur XR4Ti-like grille until 1991 for XR4 and 1992 for five-door models, when it was replaced by the Volkswagen Santana-based Galaxy.[30] Argentinian Sierras can be distinguished by a more sculpted front bumper with an extra cooling inlet.
