At the physical layer, both SCL and SDA lines are of open-drain design, thus pull-up resistors are needed. A logic "0" is output by pulling the line to ground, and a logic "1" is output by letting the line float (output high impedance) so that the pull-up resistor pulls it high. A line is never actively driven high. This wire-ANDing allows multiple nodes to connect to the bus without short circuits from signal contention. High-speed systems (and some others) may use a current source instead of a resistor to pull-up on SCL or both SCL and SDA, to accommodate higher bus capacitance and enable faster rise times.
