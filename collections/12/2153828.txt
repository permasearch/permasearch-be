The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan's "One Too Many Mornings", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album Tangled Up in Blues. On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 56. Following his death, The Band broke up for good. In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members' financial interests in the group, with the exception of Helm,[41] giving him major control of the presentation of the group's material, including latter-day compilations. Richard Bell died of multiple myeloma in June 2007. The Band received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award on February 9, 2008, [42] but there was no reunion of all three living members. In honor of the event, Helm held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock.[43] On April 17, 2012, it was announced via Helm's official website that he was in the "final stages of cancer";[44] he died two days later.[45]
