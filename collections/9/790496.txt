In The Reptile Room, the Hook-Handed Man poses as a doctor named Dr. O. Lucafont to examine the supposed bite marks that the Mamba Du Mal supposedly left on Montgomery Montgomery. When Stefano was exposed as Count Olaf, Sunny bites off the Dr. O. Lucafont's fake hands exposing him as well. Both men managed to get away.
