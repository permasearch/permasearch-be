Forsyth eschews psychological complexity in favour of meticulous plotting around real-world institutions and laws, based on detailed factual research. His books are full of information about the technical details of such subjects as money laundering, gun running and identity theft. His novels read like investigative journalism in fictional guise.[17] His moral vision is a harsh one: the world is made up of predators and prey, and only the strong survive[citation needed].
