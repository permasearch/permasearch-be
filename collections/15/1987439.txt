The first census ever taken in Texas was “The Atascosito Census of 1826.”  The census takers were Mathew G. White, Joseph W. Brown, George Orr and Henry W. Munson.  After the census was taken, the results of a vote of the people showed that a majority of those in the district desired to be added to Austin’s Colony, rather than the Nacogdoches District.
