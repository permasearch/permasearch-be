Service: Ramsay gave each of the chefs an opportunity to run the hot pass. During the chefs' time on the pass, they had to complete quality control checks, including sous-chef Scott sabotaging the food and Jean-Philippe leaving out an entree from an order. Jay had a very strong start and passed both of his quality control tests comfortably. Holli had a nervous start and failed the first of her quality control tests, but recovered. Benjamin, despite failing his first quality check by not noticing he had been given venison wellingtons rather than lamb wellingtons, proved to be a strong leader. Autumn had a shaky start by failing to notice she had been given the wrong sauce and then angered Ramsay by not taking the mistake seriously. She then became excessively nitpicky and started sending back dishes which the other chefs and even Scott thought were cooked correctly.
