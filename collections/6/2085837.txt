Monsanto developed and sold recombinant bovine somatotropin (also known as rBST and rBGH), a synthetic hormone that increases milk production by 11â€“16% when injected into cows.[136][137] In October 2008, Monsanto sold this business to Eli Lilly for $300 million plus additional considerations.[138]
