In the various editions of the official Latin nomenclature (Nomina Anatomica, in 1998 rebaptized as Terminologia Anatomica), three different spellings can be found, i.e. cartilago thyreoidea.[13] cartilago thyroidea[14][15][16][17][18][19]  and the previously mentioned cartilago thyreoides.[3][20] The variant with the adjective thyreoidea (with the ending -ea) would be a faulty rendering[6][21] of Ancient Greek θυρεοειδής in Latin. Greek compounds ending in -ειδής, when imported into Latin as a loanword, ended in -ides.[6][22] In the 17th-century the non-classical Latin form -ideus/-idea/ideum for Greek -ειδής/-ειδές came into use, mostly by French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger.[7] No Greek loanwords (originally -ειδής/-ειδές) ending in -ideus/-idea/-ideum exist in classical Latin,[5][22] thereby making the -ideus/-idea/-ideum form non-Latinate in character.[22] The first edition of the Jena Nomina Anatomica (JNA) contained the incorrect cartilago thyreoidea,[23] but after a list of recommendations/corrections was made[23] this was corrected in subsequent editions of the JNA.[3][20]
