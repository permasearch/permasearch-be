Each of the principal actors made approximately $75,000 per episode, with Sheen's confirmed salary being $300,000.[9] Rob Lowe left the series in the fourth season reportedly due to not getting a salary increase.[10] Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes, particularly by Janney, Schiff, Spencer, and Whitford. During contract negotiations in 2001, the four were threatened with breach of contract suits by Warner Bros. However, by banding together, they were able to persuade the studio to more than double their salaries.[9] Two years later, the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries, a few months after Warner Bros had signed new licensing deals with NBC and Bravo.[11]
