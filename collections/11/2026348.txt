Additional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with methane in the atmosphere, oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas,[51] and a younger — thus fainter — Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.[18]
