The term "quackery" is perjorative "An article should not assert that the most popular view is the correct one, nor should this be implied by mentioning some views only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions." The term should be removed as it violates neutrality. Also the Wikipedia Neutral Point of View page states, "It is not sufficient to discuss an opinion as fact merely by stating "some people believe...", a practice referred to as "mass attribution".[3] A reliable source supporting that a group holds an opinion must accurately describe how large this group is." Quackery and pseudoscience are opinions because they are not undisputed facts according to Wikipedia NPOV page "By value or opinion,[2] on the other hand, we mean "a matter which is subject to dispute." The statement needs a reference to who it is that has that opinion and how large the group is. If this is not included it can not be considered neutral and must be eliminated completely.--Internal Capsule (talk) 06:49, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
