DeVry was founded in 1931 as the DeForest Training School in Chicago, Illinois.[5] School founder Herman A. DeVry, who had previously invented a motion picture projector and produced educational and training films, named the school after his friend Lee de Forest.[5] De Forest Training School originally taught projector and radio repair, but later expanded to include other electronic equipment such as televisions.[5] The school was renamed DeVry Technical Institute in 1953 and gained accreditation to confer associate degrees in electronics in 1957.[5]
