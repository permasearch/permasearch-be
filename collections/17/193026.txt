Conversely, DST can adversely affect farmers,[76] parents of young children,[76] and others whose hours are set by the sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice,[94] although some farmers are neutral.[95] One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable.[9] Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems.[78][96] Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.[97]
