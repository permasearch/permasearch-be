World of Tanks is a massively multiplayer online game developed by the Belarusian-Cypriot[5] company Wargaming, featuring mid-20th century (1930s-1960s) era combat vehicles.[6] It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of "premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle, which may be a light, medium or heavy tank, tank destroyer, or self-propelled gun. World of Tanks debuted as an eSports game at the World Cyber Games 2012.[7]
