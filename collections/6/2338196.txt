Although most of the direct-to-video Hellraiser sequels were conceived as original screenplays that were later converted into Hellraiser films, Tunnicliffe's idea for Judgment was intended to be a part of the series from its conception.[25] He removed the Hellraiser elements from it after trying to get a meeting with Dimension, who were uninterested in making another Hellraiser film immediately after Revelations. He showed Judgment to Mike Jay Regan, who enjoyed the premise and suggested the removal of Pinhead as a standalone project.[26] Tunnicliffe then attempted to make it as an independent film but failed to find financial backers, after which he briefly tried to acquire funding via Kickstarter in 2013,[27] but removed the funding campaign from the site. Five years after not being able to direct Revelations, he was offered the job of writing and directing another Hellraiser film by the studio, who were once again approaching the expiration deadline. He was told by Dimension that the production wouldn't be as rushed as Revelations's, asking him if he had any specific script ideas.[26] Tunnicliffe pitched Hellraiser: Judgment to them three consecutive times, only for it to be rejected. As a result, Tunnicliffe wrote a script treatment for a more traditional Hellraiser film titled Enter Darkness to show that he could come up with other ideas. It was about psychiatric hospital interns studying several patients with shared experiences involving the Lament Configuration, while the head doctor collates them with the intention of encountering the Cenobites himself.[26] The studio embraced it, but he insisted on making Judgment.[28] Dimension eventually told him to write the script for his Judgment concept under the condition that if they disliked it, he would have to direct Enter Darkness with no payment. Subsequent to reading it, they allowed Tunnicliffe to direct Judgment as part of the series, after a period of negotiating various rewrites, notes, and suggested changes.[28][25]
