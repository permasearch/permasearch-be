The original title for the first draft of Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind was "Tote The Weary Load", a lyric from  "My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!"[45] The lyric "a few more days for to tote the weary load" appears in the text of the novel as Scarlett O'Hara is returning to Tara.[46]
