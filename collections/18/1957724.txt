Sinusitis, also known as a sinus infection or rhinosinusitis, is inflammation of the sinuses resulting in symptoms.[1] Common signs and symptoms include thick nasal mucus, a plugged nose, and pain in the face.[1] Other signs and symptoms may include fever, headaches, poor sense of smell, sore throat, and cough.[2][3] The cough is often worse at night.[3] Serious complications are rare.[3] It is defined as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) if it lasts for more than 12 weeks.[1]
