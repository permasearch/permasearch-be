In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", about six weeks after their group is overrun, Sasha, along with Tyreese, Allen, Ben and a mortally wounded Donna (who later dies of her wound), find an entrance into A-Block of the prison. They are found by Carl (Chandler Riggs), who leads them into the foyer of the cell block.[20] In the episode "The Suicide King", Hershel (Scott Wilson) tends to any wounds that the small group have, before Beth (Emily Kinney) walks into the room with baby Judith, to which Sasha, shocked, says that she never thought she would see another baby again. After Rick's group returns from Woodbury, Rick almost accepts them into his group. However, after hallucinating Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), Rick tells Lori to get out, but Sasha's group leaves the prison in a misunderstanding.[21] In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", a few days later, Sasha's group is found by Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Milton (Dallas Roberts), whom the latter leads back to Woodbury. The Governor appoints Sasha and Tyreese as soldiers, specifically as "wall guards."[22]
