Rates of malnutrition tend to increase with age with less than 10 percent of the "young" elderly (up to age 75) malnourished, while 30 to 65 percent of the elderly in home care, long-term care facilities, or acute hospitals are malnourished.[140] Many elderly people require assistance in eating, which may contribute to malnutrition.[139] Because of this, one of the main requirements of elderly care is to provide an adequate diet and all essential nutrients.[141]
