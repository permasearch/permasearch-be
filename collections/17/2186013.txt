This song of the various-minded man Who after he had plundered The innermost citadel of hallowed Troy Was made to stray grievously About the coasts of men The sport of their customs good or bad While his heart Through all the sea-faring Ached in an agony to redeem himself And bring his company safe home  Vain hopeâ€”for them For his fellows he strove in vain Their own witlessness cast them away The fools To destroy for meat The oxen of the most exalted sun Wherefore the Sun-God blotted out The day of their return  Make the tale live for us In all its many bearings
