The video for the song was directed by Marty Callner and received heavy rotation on MTV. It was one of the most requested videos of 1994.[1] It featured the third appearance of Alicia Silverstone in the band's videos, and was the career debut of Steven's then-teenaged daughter Liv Tyler. The decision to cast Liv in the video for "Crazy" was based on the video's creators having seen her in a Pantene commercial.
