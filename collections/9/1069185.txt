A distinguishing feature is how males and females process information and then recall what was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate the meaning of a discussion with gestures.[59] Since males follow verbal cues they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them maintain the memories.[59] Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone's voice.[59] They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women.[59] The only similarity they have is that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.[59]
