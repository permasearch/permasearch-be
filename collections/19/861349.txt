in other words it is the expectation of the square of the weighted sum (across parameters) of the differences between the estimators and the corresponding parameters to be estimated.  (Since we are considering the case in which all the parameter estimates are unbiased, this mean squared error is the same as the variance of the linear combination.) The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the vector     β   {\displaystyle \beta }    of parameters      β  j     {\displaystyle \beta _{j}}    is one with the smallest mean squared error for every vector     λ   {\displaystyle \lambda }   of linear combination parameters.  This is equivalent to the condition that
