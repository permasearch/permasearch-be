The Crone (portrayed by Grace Zabriskie). She is the ancient, demonic foreseer who is the first demon in the entire series to go after Piper and Leo's child, Wyatt. Unlike most demons in the series, The Crone never had any personal intentions towards the Charmed Ones. Her only intentions were to kidnap baby Wyatt, not to harm him, but in order to lay hands on him to gain a foresight in his future. She first appears in the episode Baby's First Demon where she is shown to be in control over a demonic market run by demons and warlocks. She sends numerous demons to go after Wyatt, but fails at these attempts. The Crone blames the unsuccessful attempts to kidnap the baby on one of the demons at the market and she vanquishes him after causing Phoebe and Piper to go after his alerts and cause destruction in the demonic market. The Crone makes her second appearance in the episode Sense and Sense Ability where she weakens the Charmed Ones' senses with the aid of a totem monkey of See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Speak No Evil. She tricks Wyatt into believing she is one of the family, therefore, succeeds into gaining a premonition, only to be caught seconds later by Piper, Phoebe and Paige. The Crone, amazed by Wyatt's incredible and destructible abilities, is vanquished by the Charmed Ones, who gain their senses back.
