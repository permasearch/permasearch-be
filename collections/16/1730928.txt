The 42nd Ontario general election is scheduled to be held on or before June 7, 2018.[1] Under amendments passed by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 2004, Ontario elections had previously been held on the first Thursday of October in the fourth calendar year unless the Assembly is dissolved earlier by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario due to a motion of no confidence or on the advice of the Premier of Ontario.[2] A motion of no confidence is unlikely as the current government has a majority, though Premier Kathleen Wynne stated in June 2015 that she would likely advise to dissolve the Legislature in the spring of 2018 rather than in October of that year in order to avoid any conflict with municipal elections and take advantage of better weather and longer days.[3] Attorney General of Ontario Yasir Naqvi introduced Bill 45, the Election Statute Law Amendment Act, 2016, to the Legislative Assembly in October 2016 to amend the previous fixed election date law, which included moving the election date to the first Thursday in June of the fourth calendar year.[1] The bill received royal assent on December 8, 2016.[4]
