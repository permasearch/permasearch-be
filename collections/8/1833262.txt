"When the Whip Comes Down" is seen by some Rolling Stones fans[who?] as the closest the Stones came to outright punk music on the album that many[who?] call the Stones' "punk album". It is also one of a few songs on the album to carry a heavy New York City influence. A majority of the Rolling Stones were living in New York at the time.
