The twins almost died in an explosion as Cane fought off his father in order to save his children. After the twins were both in safe hands, Lily was shocked that her husband lied to her and vowed that she wouldn't let Cane be a part of their children's lives anymore. Lily later filed for divorce from Cane, who decided to move back to Australia because he had no reason to stay in Genoa City since Lily didn't love him anymore. While at the airport, Lily arrived with the twins, and the family reunited again in an embrace. Lily then allowed Cane to see the babies for supervised and scheduled visits, much to the dismay of Neil Winters and Daniel Romalotti. After Lily learned that Cane was keeping secrets from her because he was working with law enforcement to take down his father, Colin, she forgave him for being so standoffish, and the couple reunited with their children.
