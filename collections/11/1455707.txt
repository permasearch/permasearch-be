The assignment of slave addresses is one weakness of IÂ²C. 7 bits is too few to prevent address collisions between the many thousands of available devices, and manufacturers rarely dedicate enough pins to configure the full slave address used on a given board. 3 pins is typical, giving only 8 choices of slave address. While some devices can set multiple address bits per pin,[26][27] e.g., by using a spare internal ADC channel to sense one of 8 ranges set by an external voltage divider, usually each pin controls 1 address bit. Manufacturers may provide pins to configure a few low-order bits of the address and arbitrarily set the higher-order bits to some value based on the model. This limits the number of devices of that model that may be present on the same bus to some low number, typically between 2 and 8. That partially addresses the issue of address collisions between different vendors.
