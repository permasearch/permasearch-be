As late as January 2013, the Geauga Lake side was still for sale and projects similar to Crocker Park in Westlake, Ohio were being considered.[17] Bainbridge Township and Cedar Fair hoped to have it resolved by the end of 2013.[18] In March 2013, Cedar Fair announced that they were putting Geauga Lake's property up for sale again. Unlike before, they were willing to sell the land in parcels.[19] Several companies showed interest in the land.[20][21] On September 17, 2017, a plaque was unveiled in memory of the park.[22]
