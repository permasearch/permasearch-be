Since divorce is increasing in many areas, sometimes celebrated with "divorce parties",[186] there is dating advice for the freshly divorced as well, which includes not talking about your ex or your divorce, but focusing on "activities that bring joy to your life."[33] Adviser Claire Rayner in The Guardian suggests calling people from your address book with whom you haven't been in touch for years and say "I'd love to get back in contact."[187] Do activities you like doing with like-minded people; if someone seems interesting to you, tell them.[187] It's more acceptable for this group for women to ask men out.[187]
