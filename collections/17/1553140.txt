Land and sea breezes: Land gains and loses heat more rapidly than water. During the day, the land warms more rapidly than the water. The air above land warms, becomes thinner, and rises, drawing cooler air landward from the sea. At night, the process reverses, and cool heavy air from the land flows out to sea. These land and sea breezes are important along the coast.
