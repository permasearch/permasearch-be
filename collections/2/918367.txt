While allowed to do some planned photo-ops with other mascots (such as Aubie from archrival Auburn University), Big Al, as per University rule, is generally not allowed to interact on the field with opponent mascots. This is due to an incident in 2002 that took place between Big Al and Seymour from Southern Miss during a game in Tuscaloosa. A "fight" was scripted before the game, in which the rules were that Big Al “loses” the fight in front of the visitors’ section, and Big Al dominates in front of his student section.[7] The scripted fight suddenly turned unscripted after Seymour deviated from the set rules, and a raucous fight on the sidelines between the two ensued.[8]
