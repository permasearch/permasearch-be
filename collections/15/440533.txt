Later versions of the song insert a profane interjection during a pause in the chorus (from the audience during live performances or from a guest separate from the lead singer): "Alice! Who the fuck is Alice?" (guests will sometimes say "hell" or "heck" for cleaner performances). These performances may also change a line in the chorus so that the singer's affections are as much sexual as they are romantic, and that the singer had hoped "to get inside her pants", instead of "get a second glance."
