Olmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and shamans. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule.[77] There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called "transformation figures".[78]
