The definition of a business day varies by region. It depends on the local workweek which is dictated by local customs, religions, and business operations. For example, in the United States and much of the Western world, they are typically Monday to Friday. Within the European Union, the normal business days are Monday to Friday based on the working time regulation of the EU.
