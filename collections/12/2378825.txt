When we did the 'Music' video, it was a weird time. [Madonna] was pregnant and we didn't want her to look pregnantâ€”so we had to work around that. We had an idea to do a fun party video with her and her girls, make it a little bling and cowboy hats and all that. We wanted to have some comedy in there and I wanted to do some animation.[70]
