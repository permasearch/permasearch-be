Saba University School of Medicine was founded in 1992 as an international alternative to U.S. and Canadian medical schools. Since its founding, more than 2500 students have earned their medical degree at Saba.[2] Saba University's graduates practice primarily in the United States and Canada. The Saba website features graduates who have gone on to appointments at medical centers in the US and Canada including the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, the University of Toronto, Yale and more.[3] In recent years, 99% of Saba's students have passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt.[2] Class sizes are 80-100 students per matriculating class. Students complete the first 20 months (five semesters) of basic science medical education on the campus on Saba and return to the US and Canada to complete clinical rotations at hospitals affiliated with the school.
