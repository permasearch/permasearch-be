"The Dangling Conversation" concerns a dying relationship,[16] but Garfunkel disliked the song, feeling it pretentious.[8] In contrast to its earlier appearance on The Paul Simon Songbook, "Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall" appears here as a "folk combo that produces a bright, almost bluegrass sound".[17] "A Simple Desultory Philippic" is a "satirical rant about the singer's confrontations with a wide variety of pop-culture personalities and phenomena".[17] In the song, Simon vocally imitates Bob Dylan, as well as his harmonica interjections.[18] "For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her" has sometimes been thought to be named after poet Emily Dickinson.[18] Simon later explained that "For Emily" is not about an imaginary girl Emily, but about a belief, while the song "Overs" (from the album Bookends) is about the loss of that belief.[19] While other songs, such as "The Sound of Silence", had taken months for Simon to complete writing, others, such as "For Emily", were written in a single night.[20] "A Poem on the Underground Wall" largely revolves around a man creating graffiti on a sign in a subway station, with Simon also bringing into play "a variety of visceral and religious images".[21]
