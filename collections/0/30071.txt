"She's Like the Wind" is a 1987 power ballad[2] from the film Dirty Dancing, performed by Patrick Swayze. Though Swayze is the primary vocalist on the single, it was billed as being performed by "Patrick Swayze featuring Wendy Fraser"; Fraser is heard throughout much of the song, specifically in the final chorus. The single reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart.[3]
