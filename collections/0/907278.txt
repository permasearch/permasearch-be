In Fuse's original state as a rock and alternative station, the same versions as on MTV were shown. "Stan" was also released on track 17 of Curtain Call: The Hits, which features Elton John. On the clean and explicit versions of Curtain Call: The Hits, the live track censored only the profanity, unlike the clean version of the studio track version of "Stan".
