British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased, with plain paper, cardboard, or plastic being used instead. In the United Kingdom, the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003[16] and in Ireland the European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations 2003 [17] respectively enact directive 2065/2001/EC, and generally mean that "fish" must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named; so, for example, "cod and chips" now appears on menus rather than the more vague "fish and chips". In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this;[18] but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it cannot be sold merely as "fish and chips".[19][20][21]
