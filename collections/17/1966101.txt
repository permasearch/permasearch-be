Young people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives.[22] Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university.[23] In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working.[24]
