Beginning on the first anniversary of this victory in 1777 Charlestonians and South Carolinians celebrate "Carolina Day" annually to commemorate this first major victory of American Forces over the British. Each year local events include a parade in downtown Charleston and reenactments at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island.[citation needed]
