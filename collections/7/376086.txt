Peter Hook of New Order cited Giorgio Moroder's production on "The Number One Song in Heaven" as a major influence when his band changed of musical style to produce electro/dance rock songs like "Temptation" in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of "When I'm With You" that same year in Milano.[54] When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan.[55] and composer Martin Gore,[56] of Depeche Mode cited them as one of their favorite bands. Gore also later covered "Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth" on his Counterfeit e.p. in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League,[57] and Erasure,[58] also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about "This Town ain't...": "There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song."[59]
