T. brucei are able to undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. Meiosis occurs within the salivary glands of the tsetse fly and is thought to be a normal part of development.[32] The meiotic process results in production of haploid promastigote-like gametes. These gametes can interact with each other using their flagella, and then fuse.
