During a convention held in 1938, the Muslim League devised a scheme of constitution under which Muslims would attain full independence.[66] It was the province of Sindh which first adopted the resolution for an independent Muslim state.[67] The Muslim League had secured an exclusive mandate from Sindh during the general elections held in 1945. The Muslim majority in Sindh was in support of the policy and the programme of the Muslim League as the Muslim League had good relations with Sindhi nationalists.[67]
