Levirate marriages will sometimes be performed to give support to the widows and their children.[26] Sometimes they are considered a restraint on the womanâ€™s liberty. In some cases Levirate marriages are only performed for when a man died childless in order to continue his family line. In Deuteronomy 25: 5-6, The Hebrew Bible mandates Levirate marriages, known as a yibbum, for a man whose married brother died, unless the brother has a child. When a levirate marriage is not required (such as when the deceased brother had a child) it is forbidden by Leviticus 16:18. A halitzah, which releases the widow to remarry a man of her choosing, is now typically performed instead of a Levirate marriage.
