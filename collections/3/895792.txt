Microsoft Access 2007 introduced a new database format: ACCDB.  It supports links to SharePoint lists and complex data types such as multivalue and attachment fields.  These new field types are essentially recordsets in fields and allow the storage of multiple values or files in one field. Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) field.
