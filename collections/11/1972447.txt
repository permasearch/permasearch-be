David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records, had the idea to record the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues based on The Simpsons, to be released in time for Christmas 1990.[48] The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop.[49] The album faced great publicity before its release. One particular element that was highly publicized was Michael Jackson's involvement, which was denied around the time of the album's release.[49] Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of "Do the Bartman", which Groening denied in a press release.[49] However, Groening revealed in 1998 that "Do the Bartman" was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson,[50][51] but he could not receive credit for it because he was under contract to another record label.[52] Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons, especially Bart,[53] and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how "Do the Bartman" came about.[54] Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode "Stark Raving Dad".[55]
