As a matter of law, the Governor-General is not in the same constitutional position as the Sovereign; the office itself does not independently possess any powers of the Royal Prerogative. If present in New Zealand, the monarch may exercise her powers personally.[37] Furthermore, some powers, such as the approval of a new Royal Honour, may be exercised by the monarch alone.[40]
