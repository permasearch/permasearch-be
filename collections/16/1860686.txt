The earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient Egyptian civilization, thereafter related to the Greek civilization.[31] By the 2nd millennium BCE two broad forms of cult image appear, in one images are zoomorphic (god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion) and in another anthropomorphic (god in the image of man).[27] The former is more commonly found in ancient Egypt influenced beliefs, while the anthropomorphic images are more commonly found in Indo-European cultures.[31][32] Symbols of nature, useful animals or feared animals may also be included by both. The stelae from 4,000 to 2,500 BCE period discovered in France, Ireland through Ukraine, and in Central Asia through South Asia, suggest that the ancient anthropomorphic figures included zoomorphic motifs.[32] In Nordic and Indian subcontinent, bovine (cow, ox, -*gwdus, -*g'ou) motifs or statues, for example, were common.[33][34] In Ireland, iconic images included pigs.[35]
