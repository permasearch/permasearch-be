A stated issue appears to be "it doesn't work that way in real life". That is true but remember the OSI model is theoretical. Therefore the statement that JPEG or XML are not handled in the presentation layer is incorrect. That is the layer they would be handled in, IF the presentation layer actually existed in fact as opposed to theory. There are multiple mappings between the OSI model and "real world" implementations, some of those mappings disagree. SunSw0rd (talk) 17:21, 16 August 2011 (UTC)
