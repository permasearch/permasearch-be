In a statistical test, the null hypothesis (     H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}  ) is considered valid until enough data proves it wrong. Then      H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}   is rejected and the alternative hypothesis (     H  A     {\displaystyle H_{A}}  ) is considered to be proven as correct. By chance this can happen, although      H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}   is true, with a probability denoted     α   {\displaystyle \alpha }   (the significance level). This can be compared to the judicial process, where the accused is considered innocent (     H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}  ) until proven guilty (     H  A     {\displaystyle H_{A}}  ) beyond reasonable doubt (    α   {\displaystyle \alpha }  ).
