Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating, declaring it the "apotheosis" of Star Wars.[45] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ for living up to its massive hype, adding "charm is the foremost of this epic's contemporary characteristics. The script is witty, knowing, cool."[69] Eight years later, Entertainment Weekly would rate the film as one of the best disaster films of all time.[63] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film did an "excellent job conveying the boggling immensity of [the] extraterrestrial vehicles [â€¦] and panic in the streets" and the scenes of the alien attack were "disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing".[4]
