The sodium chloride (NaCl) polymorph is most common. A cubic close-packed arrangement of chloride anions with rubidium cations filling the octahedral holes describes this polymorph.[4] Both ions are six-coordinate in this arrangement. This polymorph's lattice energy is only 3.2Â kJ/mol less than the following structure's.[5]
