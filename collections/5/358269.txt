An incident before the tournament was the theft and refinding of the trophy. The final, held at Wembley Stadium,[2] was the last to be broadcast in black and white.[3] The tournament held a FIFA record for the largest average attendance until it was surpassed by Mexico in 1970. It was boycotted by most independent countries from Africa who objected to the qualification requirements. Despite this, the number of entries for the qualifying tournament was a new record, with 70 nations.
