In March 2009, Suleman bought a new house in La Habra,[33] and many stories questioned that the octuplets would be released from the hospital, while Suleman expressed concern about losing custody of them.[34] In the early morning hours of April 1, the day she would bring home the seventh octuplet, vandals threw a baby seat through the back window of her Toyota minivan.[35][36][37] As of April 14, 2009, all of the children were home with their mother and grandmother. The octuplets celebrated their first birthday on January 26, 2010. Suleman told People magazine, "I don't get much sleep, about two or three hours a night. But I'm continuing to move forward with my life and trying to be the best mother I can be."[38]
