Concourse G is the only one of the original 1959 concourses that has largely remained in its original state, save for the modifications the rest of the airport received in the mid-1960s and an extension in the early 1970s. It is the only concourse at the airport incapable of handling international arrivals, although it is frequently used for departing international charters. The airport authority plans to maintain the concourse until 2025.[36]
