HQ has been criticized for its method of paying winners. Typically, victorious players receive between $10 and $14,[15] but payouts have been as low as $0.28 or as high as $50,000, on two cases.[16][17] In order to cash out and receive their winnings through a PayPal deposit, winners previously needed to have achieved a "minimum prize balance" of $20 accumulated within a period of 90 days, or all prior winnings are forfeited, per the game's terms of service.[16][18] Starting on January 26, 2018, during the 3Â pm EST show, it was announced that there would be no minimum amount to cash out.[19]
