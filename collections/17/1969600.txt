The poem was first published in 1913 and is considered one of the leading poems of the Imagist tradition. Pound's process of deletion from thirty lines[5] to only fourteen words typifies Imagism's focus on economy of language, precision of imagery and experimenting with non-traditional verse forms. The poem is Poundâ€™s written equivalent for the moment of revelation and intense emotion he felt at the Metro at La Concorde, Paris.
