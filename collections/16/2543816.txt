Many of the talents Peeta exhibits in the arena are a byproduct of his work in the family bakery and time spent on the school wrestling team. An accomplished baker and painter, he is also particularly skilled at hand-to-hand combat, camouflage, throwing knives, and starting fires. Peeta also has a remarkable talent for speaking to crowds. Not only is he initially responsible for making the Capitol crowds fall in love with Katniss, Katniss herself mentions that Peeta would be invaluable to the revolution because of his ability "to turn his pain into words that will transform people."
