In Scotland of the 1990s, "Ryan" was the most popular forename for newborn boys in every year from 1994 to 1998;[8] this popularity is recent, as "Ryan" apparently was not in use in 1900, ranked between 100 and 250 in 1950, and appears at rank 64 in 1975. In Northern Ireland, "Ryan" appeared among the top five most commonly selected male names for newborns in 2000–2003, but did not appear among the top ten in 1975.[9]  In England and Wales, data for 2003–2007 is available, which suggest somewhat less popularity of "Ryan" than in other parts of the UK, having a rank of 21 in 2003 and 2004 then dropping to 25 in 2005–2007.[10]
