Side note: This has nothing to do with further information on the word Mizpah. I'm merely trying to express the significance of the beauty of this word. It is essentially a way of saying good-bye without truly telling a person that it is the end. It embodies the hope of another meeting, a desire for something to last or begin again. This is a word drenched in longing and wistfulness. You may call me a hopeless romantic and so shoot me for looking for the beauty those two syllables contain. I'm finished with this edit and to whoever is reading this, mizpah. I don't know you, but you have seen a snippet of myself and at least I (sort of) have the knowledge that you read this far, either to mock me or because you relate to my sentiment. I hope some higher power watches over you (if there is one that is.) So therefore, mizpah.
