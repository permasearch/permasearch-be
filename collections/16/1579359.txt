Some variations depend on the version of the fable that is being recorded. In the version by Samuel Croxall (1732), which was widely followed, the uprooted oak is floating downstream and enquires of a reed how it has survived the storm.[20] In George Fyler Townsend's new translation (1867), the oak has fallen across a stream and asks the same question of the reeds there.[21]
