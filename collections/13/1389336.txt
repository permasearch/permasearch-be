In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began studying the nature and interaction of colors. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe presented his own theory in 1810, stating that the two primary colors were those in the greatest opposition to each other, yellow and blue, representing light and darkness. He wrote that "Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; blue is a darkness weakened by light."[9]  Out of the opposition of blue and yellow, through a process called "steigerung, or "augementation" a third color, red, was born.[pageÂ needed]  Goethe also proposed several sets of complementary colors which "demanded" each other. According to Goethe, "yellow 'demands' violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa".[10]  Goethe's ideas were highly personal and often  disagreed with other scientific research, but they were highly popular and influenced some important artists,  including  J.M.W. Turner.[11]
