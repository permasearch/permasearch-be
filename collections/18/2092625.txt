On May 5–6, 2006 in a game that became known as the "Music City Marathon", the Zephyrs played 24 innings in Nashville, ultimately defeating the Sounds 5–4 the next day on a Wiki González RBI single. The Z's scored once in the eighth and once in the ninth, and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was called.
