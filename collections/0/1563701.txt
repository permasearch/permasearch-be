Reports alleged that there was an investigation by the FBI into the conduct of the judge presiding over his case, Judge Brinkley.[68] This was later publicly acknowledged by Mill's defense team.[69]   Meek's attorney, Joe Tacopina, made several allegations of inappropriate statements and actions from Brinkley, including that "she requested he re-record a Boyz II Men song and shout her out, and how she wanted him to leave Roc Nation to sign with a friend of hers" and that "she showed up at his community service" when a typical judge would not do that, among several other irregularities.[70]
