In addition to his key lieutenants, King Hiss also has a huge army of slithering minions willing to do his bidding. The 2002 series featured the full force of the Snake Men, and two action figures based on these generic warriors (one yellow, one orange) were released in 2012 for Mattel's Masters of the Universe Classics toyline.
