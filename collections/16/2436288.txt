Khinkali is a Georgian dumpling[16] which originated in the mountain regions of Pshavi, Mtiuleti, and Khevsureti.[17] Varieties of khinkali spread from there across different parts of the Caucasus.[18] The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe consistsof only minced meat (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, chili pepper, salt and cumin. Modern recipes use herbs like parsley and coriander. In Muslim-majority areas the use of beef and lamb is more prevalent. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.
