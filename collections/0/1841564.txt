In Saved by the Bell, Zack breaks the fourth wall on numerous occasions. During many episodes, he would introduce the episode, or speak his opinion on different topics, such as Slater, Kelly, etc. Usually when he is notably worried about something Zack says "Time Out", and make a motion with his hands similar to a basketball player requesting a time out from the referee, and everyone around him freezes. Immediately after, Zack usually offers his opinion, and says "Time In!" when he is finished, and the episode continues.
