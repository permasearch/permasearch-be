Reaching the Elite Eight for the second time in a row was a feat in and of itself. However, most felt Utah's run would end in 1998, as they were facing #1 seed Arizona, the defending national champions. Yet, using the triangle-and-two defense, Utah defeated Arizona 76–51. The game, one of the worst losses in Wildcat history, pushed Utah to their first Final Four in 32 years, where they beat the #1 overall seed, North Carolina, 65–59.
