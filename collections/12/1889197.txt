Storage-device brands differ in their support for homebrew; DS, 3DS and Game Boy Advance ROMs; special features (such as ability to play media files); physical size and cost. Strictly speaking, a storage device is not necessary for DS with FlashMe installed because homebrew can be sent to the DS using Wireless Multiboot or WMB. However, this is not an easily portable method because the DS needs to be within range of a suitable Wi-Fi card.
