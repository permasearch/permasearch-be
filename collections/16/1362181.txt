For the first two series, the first episode was aired on BBC One, followed by the second episode on CBBC. For subsequent episodes, the date is when it first aired on CBBC, immediately after the previous episode was aired on BBC One. Some episode repeats were also shown as a 55 minute episode rather than the traditional Part one and two format.[6]
