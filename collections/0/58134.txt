Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies.[2] Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria such as Staph. aureus.[2] Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma.[2] Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food.[2] Often a number of factors are involved.[2] Other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function.[2][5] Diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies.[2]
