In 1889, Debussy held conversations with his former teacher Guiraud, which included exploration of harmonic possibilities at the piano.  The discussion, and Debussy's chordal keyboard improvisations, were noted by a younger pupil of Guiraud, Maurice Emmanuel.[120] The chord sequences played by Debussy include some of the elements identified by Reti. They may also indicate the influence on Debussy of Satie's 1887 Trois Sarabandes.[121]  A further improvisation by Debussy during this conversation included a sequence of whole tone harmonies which may have been inspired by the music of Glinka or Rimsky-Korsakov which was becoming known in Paris at this time.[122] During the conversation, Debussy told Guiraud, "There is no theory. You have only to listen. Pleasure is the law!" â€“ although he also conceded, "I feel free because I have been through the mill, and I don't write in the fugal style because I know it."[120]
