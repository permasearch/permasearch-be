A golf-like game is, apocryphally,[1][2] recorded as taking place on  February 26, 1297, in Loenen aan de Vecht, where the Dutch played a game with a stick and leather ball. The winner was whoever hit the ball with the least number of strokes into a target several hundred yards away. Some scholars argue that this game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using golf clubs was also played in 17th-century Netherlands and that this predates the game in Scotland.[3] There are also other reports of earlier accounts of a golf-like game from continental Europe.[4]
