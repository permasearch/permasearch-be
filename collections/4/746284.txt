1997 In an AP Top-15 match up between both teams which featured ESPN College Gameday in East Lansing, the #5 Michigan Wolverines defeated the #15 Spartans, 23-7. The Wolverine defense had six interceptions, five of which came from Spartan QB Todd Schultz. One of those interceptions included a one-handed interception by eventual 1997 Heisman trophy winner Charles Woodson where he managed to get one foot in bounds on the sideline. Marcus Ray had a pair of interceptions, along with one apiece by DiAllo Johnson and Andre Weathers. Michigan would go 12-0 and win the national championship that season, their first since 1948.
