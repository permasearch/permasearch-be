The use of live animals to represent the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, the inspiration for the form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman.[11] Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her.[42] The design came from Wah Chang,[43] but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline CumerÃ©. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber.[11][44] Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing.[45] Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted.[11][45] Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992.[46] The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode as part of a larger Star Trek sale.[47] Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald.[48] An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.[49]
