The British elite tended to support the Confederacy, but ordinary people tended to support the United States. Large-scale trade continued between Britain and the U.S.: The U.S. shipped grain to Britain and Britain sent manufactured items and munitions. Immigration continued into the US, with many Britons volunteering for its army. British trade with the Confederacy fell over 90% from the prewar period, with a small amount of cotton going to Britain and some munitions and luxury goods slipped in by numerous small blockade runners. They were operated and funded by British private interests. They were legal under international law, and caused no dispute between the US and the UK.[1]
