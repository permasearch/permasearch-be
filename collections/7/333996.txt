Construction of the hotel began in March 1887, "on a sandspit populated by jack rabbits and coyotes".[12] If the hotel were ever to be built, one of numerous problems to overcome was the absence of lumber and labor in the San Diego area. The lumber problem was solved with contracts for exclusive rights to all raw lumber production of the Dolbeer & Carson Lumber Company of Eureka, California, which was one of the West's largest. Planing mills were built on site to finish raw lumber shipped directly from the Dolbeer & Carson lumber yards, located on the shores of Humboldt Bay.[9] To obtain brick and concrete, Reid built his own kilns. He also constructed a metal shop and iron works.[13]
