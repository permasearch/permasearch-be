In the early hours of March 6, the Mexican army attacked the fort.[168] Troops from Béxar were excused from the front lines, so that they would not be forced to fight their families and friends.[165] In the initial moments of the assault the Mexican troops were at a disadvantage. Although their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely, inexperienced recruits in the back also discharged their weapons; many Mexican soldiers were unintentionally killed by their own comrades.[169] As Mexican soldiers swarmed over the walls, at least 80 Texians fled the Alamo and were cut down by Mexican cavalry.[170] Within an hour, almost all of the Texian defenders, estimated at 182–257 men, were killed.[Note 12] Between four and seven Texians, possibly including Crockett, surrendered. Although General Manuel Fernández Castrillón attempted to intercede on their behalf, Santa Anna insisted that the prisoners be executed immediately.[171]
