The Kannada people known as the Kannadigas and Kannadigaru[3] are the people who natively speak Kannada.[4] Kannadigas are mainly found in the state of Karnataka in India. Significant Kannada minorities are found in the Indian states of Maharashtra,[5] Tamil Nadu,[6] Andhra Pradesh, Goa[7][8] and in other Indian states.[5] The English plural is Kannadigas. After a millennium of disintegration from Old Kannada into various languages,[9][10] sister languages[11] and Kannada dialects, modern Kannada stands among 30 most widely spoken languages of the world as of 2001.[12]
