In 2001, the Supreme Student Council (SSC), the university's student governing body, led the campaign for the student representation at the PLM Board of Regents, and made the PLM community cognizant of the issue.[73] Senator Francis Pangilinan, on January 15, 2002, filed the Senate Bill No. 1967 or an act amending certain provisions of Republic Act No. 4196. The bill seeks the installation of student representation in the Board of Regents, and Senator Pangilinan perceives it as an imperative step in furthering the role of the youth in nation building.[74]
