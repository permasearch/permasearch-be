If the mass of a main-sequence star is lower than approximately half a solar mass (a red dwarf), it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds the age of the Universe (c. 13.8 billion years),[9] such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen (for a while becoming a blue dwarf) and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei.[108] Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems[5][7][8][109][110][111] or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.[112][113]
