Russia calls this sea "Япо́нское мо́ре" (Yapónskoye móre, Japanese Sea).[43][44] Japan believes that Russia played a major role in establishing this name internationally, as mentioned above. Chinese government websites exclusively use the name 日本海 (rìběnhǎi, Japan Sea).[45] In 2003, the French Defense Ministry issued nautical maps that included both terms Sea of Japan and East Sea.[46] It reverted to Sea of Japan as a single name in the map issued in 2004.[47] The United Kingdom and Germany officially use the Sea of Japan.[1]
