Today it has over 19,000 kilometers (11,806 miles) of dedicated lines alone, a length that exceeds rest of the world's high-speed rail tracks combined,[417] making it the longest HSR network in the world.[418] With an annual ridership of over 1.1 billion passengers in 2015 it is the world's busiest.[419] The network includes the Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen High-Speed Railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world.[420] The HSR track network is set to reach approximately 16,000 km (9,900 mi) by 2020.[421] The Shanghai Maglev Train, which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.[422]
