Line "1949" refers to the last BAA Playoffs. In its inaugural 1949â€“50 season only, the NBA used a three-division arrangement. Syracuse won the Eastern Division championship in the first two rounds of the 1950 NBA Playoffs and advanced to the Finals as the one of three division champions with the best regular season record.[3]
