The trophy is housed in the office of the president of the FFT, and is only removed once every year when the Men's Singles winner at the French open is announced. The winner does not get to keep the actual trophy; a new replica is produced every year.[1] The replica, which is always slightly smaller than the original, is made from a sheet of solid silver, and takes over one hundred hours to complete.[1]
