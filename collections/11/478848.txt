The Revolutionary War disrupted the deerskin trade, as the import of British manufactured goods with cut off.[69] The deerskin trade had already begun to decline due to over-hunting of deer.[77] The lack of trade caused the Native Americans to run out of items, such as guns, on which they depended.[69] Some Indians, such as the Creeks, tried to reestablish trade with the Spanish in Florida, where some loyalists were hiding as well.[69][75] When the war ended with the British retreating, many tribes who had fought on their side were now left unprotected and now had to make peace and new trading deals with the new country.[75] Many Native Americans were subject to violence from the new Americans who sought to settle their territory.[81] The new American government negotiated treaties that recognized prewar borders, such as those with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and allowed open trade.[81]
