After 200 years, a lone beaver returned to New York City in 2007, making its home along the Bronx River, having spent time living at the Bronx Zoo and the Botanical Gardens.[126] Though beaver pelts were once important to the city's economy and a pair of beavers appears on the city's official seal and flag, beavers had not lived in New York City since the early 19th century, when trappers extirpated them completely from the state.[127] The return of "José", named after Representative Jose Serrano from the Bronx, has been seen as evidence that efforts to restore the river have been successful.[128][129][130] In the summer of 2010, a second beaver named "Justin" joined José, doubling the beaver population in New York City.[131] In February 2013, what appears to be both José and Justin were caught on motion-sensitive cameras at the New York Botanical Garden.[132]
