After around 1130, North America had significant climatic change in the form of a 300-year drought called the Great Drought.[26] This also led to the collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization around Lake Titicaca in present-day Bolivia.[27] The contemporary Mississippian culture also collapsed during this period. Confirming evidence dated between 1150 and 1350 has been found in excavations of the western regions of the Mississippi Valley, which show long-lasting patterns of warmer, wetter winters and cooler, drier summers.
