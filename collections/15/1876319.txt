Another Carousel film, produced by Hugh Jackman, who would star as Billy Bigelow, has been in pre-production for several years. Like the original, this remake would be distributed by 20th Century Fox. As of May 2009, the script was reportedly finished.[18][19] Jackman mentioned that he would like to see Anne Hathaway considered for Julie Jordan. Jackman maintained that the project is still a no-go “but I think there’s more momentum for it. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the film can still happen before I’m too old to play it (Bigelow).”[20]
