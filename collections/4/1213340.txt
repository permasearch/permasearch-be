Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (RLPO) staged an event titled "George Harrison 'Within You Without You': The Story of The Beatles and Indian Music" at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall.[179] While carrying out research for this project, academics from the University of Liverpool and the University of Sheffield discovered the identity of the Indian musicians on the 1967 recording.[180] The two surviving players, Buddhadev Kansara and Natwar Soni, were among the performers at the RLPO event.[179][181]
