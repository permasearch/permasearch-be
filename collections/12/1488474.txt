The Lost Hero received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans. Publishers Weekly gave The Lost Hero a favorable review, and stated that "Riordan's storytelling is as polished as ever, brimming with wit, action, and heart".[14] The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" and that "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." However, she also noted that there are "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping that it does not end with a third Great Prophecy".[15] The Seattle Times's Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix "fascinating" and also said that the "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action".[16] Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating "I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way. You’re not going to want to miss this one!" but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail."[17] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." [18]
