Unlike other Tom and Jerry characters, this one is not a character per se, but rather an avatar of a popular character such as Spike. Usually, a character turns into a jackass when it is fooled such as Spike in Solid Serenade, The Framed Cat and Pet Peeve or Tom in Polka Dot Puss. In Pup on a Picnic, the word 'Sucker' is used instead of 'Jackass'.
