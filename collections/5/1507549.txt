Humans and other placental mammals have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as to a navel) which starts to heal when the umbilical cord is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.[15][16]
