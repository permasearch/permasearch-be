On August 14 that year, Dave Williams was found dead inside his tour bus.[2] He died from an undiagnosed heart condition, now known to be cardiomyopathy.[7][8][9] When asked if the band had any unreleased songs, according to a 2002 Blabbermouth article, drummer Mike Luce replied that "only 3-4 songs were done, including one called "Heroes," which is a tribute to dead rock musicians such as Layne Staley. I don't know if we will ever release them."[10]
