More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005.[53] The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery.[54] During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt.[53] The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iranâ€“Iraq War in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.[55][56]
