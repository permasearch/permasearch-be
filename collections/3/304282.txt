Following the international success of AM, Turner suffered from writer's block, struggling to find a direction for a new album. Having written "Sweet Dreams, TN" from Everything You've Come to Expect, he lost interest in writing love songs, with a friend suggesting "not doing that for a moment". In early 2016, upon watching Federico Fellini's 1963 film 8Â½, Turner was inspired by its depiction of writer's block, childhood memories and the science fiction genre. He began writing songs for the album on a Steinway Vertegrand piano he received as a 30th birthday gift from the Arctic Monkeys' manager Ian McAndrew, in a spare room of his Los Angeles home dubbed "Lunar Surface". During the process Turner recalled piano lessons he had received from his father at the age of eight, commenting that he "never thought [his father's influence] would find its way into [his] compositions as much as it has on this record".[2][3][4] Many of the vocal takes included on the finished album remain from Turner's home demos on a Tascam 388 8-track recording machine.[5] Guitarist Jamie Cook commented that he "was blown away by the direction Alex had gone in" when Turner played the band the demos in February 2017.[6] Initially unsure how they would record the songs, Cook suggested Turner release it as a solo album, but Turner was uninterested. Cook began recording guitar ideas to complement the demos, with bassist Nick O'Malley approving of the new direction upon hearing a demo of "Star Treatment".[7]
