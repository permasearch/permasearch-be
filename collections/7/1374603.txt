Jol Bandi (جول بینڈی‬) or Bashang (بشنگ‬) is a Baloch wedding ceremony held at the brides home and is similar in concept to Rasm-e-Heena. "Jol" means a large well decorated sheet in Balochi and "bandi" means "to close". During this ceremony, the bride is covered with the decorated sheet, usually sown by the groom’s family. This marks the beginning of the official wedding ceremony.
