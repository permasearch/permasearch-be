While the lyrics describe a girl "riding out of the life of the narrator",[20] the inspiration of the title phrase is unclear,[6] as is the meaning of the song.[21] McCartney said the title referred to "a British Railways ticket to the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight",[11] and Lennon said it described cards indicating a clean bill of health carried by Hamburg prostitutes in the 1960s.[20] The Beatles played in Hamburg early in their musical career, and a "ride" was British slang for having sex.[21] Gaby Whitehill and Andrew Trendall of Gigwise have interpreted the song to be about a woman leaving her boyfriend to become a prostitute.[22]
