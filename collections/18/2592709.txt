When Venus Pictures came out with an advertisement of their film Uthama Puthiran in a newspaper with Sivaji Ganesan in the leading role, the same day actor M. G. Ramachandran announced a film with the same-title in the same paper on the same day. With the help of N. S. Krishnan, Ganesan made Ramachandran scrap his plan of making the same film. Ramachandran nevertheless persisted his with his plans to make a double action film and finally made Nadodi Mannan, and released it much after Uthama Puthiran.[7]
