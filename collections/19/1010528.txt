The Test series marked Dale Steyn's return to international cricket. He last played in a Test match for South Africa in November 2016 against Australia in Perth, where he suffered a shoulder injury.[15] However, on day two of the first Test, Steyn damaged his left heel.[16] This ruled him out of the rest of the Test,[17] with a recovery time of 4 to 6 weeks.[18] Two days later, he was ruled out of the rest of the series.[19]
