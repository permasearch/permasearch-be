These modules, while using the same physical layout, may differ in the specified voltage - 1.5 or 1.35 volts. The lower voltage modules are sometimes, but not always, identified as DDR3L - see also DDR3 SDRAM. Low voltage modules are compatible with high voltage mainboards, but not vice versa. There are some exceptions to that rule however (see reviews at https://www.newegg.com/global/fr/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231692)
