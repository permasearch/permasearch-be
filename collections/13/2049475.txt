The VADRS was developed by Wolraich with the aim to add common comorbid conditions associated with ADHD that was lacking from previous assessments.[1][4] As public awareness of ADHD has increased, epidemiological studies have found a prevalence rate of 4-12% in children of ages 6â€“12 throughout the United States. Not only is ADHD the most commonly encountered childhood-onset disorder in neurodevelopment, there is also a high comorbidity rate linking ADHD with other behavioral, emotional and learning problems and disabilities.[5] As a need to obtain a defined population sample due to a lack of funds, Wolraich invented the teacher VADRS. The teacher rating scales allowed Wolraich to have all the kids in one class be sampled by one teacher and to increase communication between physicians and teachers.[4]
