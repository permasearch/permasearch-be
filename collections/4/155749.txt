The Third Murderer knows Banquo typically walks from the palace gate at this time. After the murder of Banquo, the Third Murderer asks "Who did strike out the light?" and concludes Fleance has escaped: "There's but one down; the son is fled." Altogether, the Third Murderer has six lines, almost all very brief,[2] with the only long one showing "a suspicious familiarity with Banquo's habits".[3]
