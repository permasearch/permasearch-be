Jack and Manners visit the Calderbeck mansion. Believing himself to be alone in the greenhouse, Jack gives a Tarzan-like cry... and turns around to discover...Jane. He also meets Lord Calderbeck's nephew and heir, Freddy. Freddy confides to Jane that he's going to ask Jack for £70,000 for the house. (Manners wants to pay no more than £50,000). Manners tells Jack that Jane was recently widowed. Jack is posing as a working-class chap who's made a fortune from making automobile spares.
