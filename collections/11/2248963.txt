The "waka waka" riff of the song also generated controversy. In June 2010, it was reported that Dominican musician Wilfrido Vargas had decided to file a lawsuit against Shakira for plagiarising the riff off his composition "El Negro No Puede" for a sum of $11 million,[14] which was performed by Dominican group Las Chicas del Can.[15] However, Vargas later directly addressed the issue and said he did not have any intention to sue Shakira, clarifying that he himself did not own the riff used in "El Negro No Puede," and that the prior statements made in his name were fabricated.[16]
