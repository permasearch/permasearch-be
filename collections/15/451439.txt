At the commemoration of the Korean War on June 25, 2010, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon paid a tribute to the soldiers from 22 countries who fought in the Korean War that started 60 years before, saying they had helped turn destruction in his native Republic of Korea into democracy and prosperity. “Out of rubble came an economic power. Out of tragedy emerged a free democratic society” [15]
