The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is a children's novel by Joan Aiken, first published in 1962.[1]  Set in an alternative history of England, it tells of the adventures of cousins Bonnie and Sylvia and their friend Simon the goose-boy as they thwart the evil schemes of their governess Miss Slighcarp, and their so called "teacher" at boarding school, Mrs. Brisket.     The reason this book is called The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is 1: because there are actual wolves, and 2: because some of the characters act like wolves, because they are selfish, and mean, and disgusting.
