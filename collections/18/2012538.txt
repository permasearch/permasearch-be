With World War I raging in Europe, Wilson became concerned that if Hughes won the election, the presidency would be occupied for four months by a "lame duck" during a crisis period. He thought it would be better for the country if instead Hughes could take office quickly. Wilson decided that if Hughes won, he would appoint Hughes Secretary of State. Then he and Vice President Marshall would resign. Under the Presidential Succession Act 1886, the Secretary of State would succeed as President. Thus Hughes would become President immediately. Wilson won the election, so the plan was never put into action.[14]
