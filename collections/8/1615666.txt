Though Philo Farnsworth had invented the first working television system in 1927, only few people owned television sets because of its price and scarcity.[3] Since most citizens did not own televisions, they relied on cinemas to keep informed and educated.

Films made during this time period were more realistic than escapist, in contrast to entertainment during the Great Depression.
