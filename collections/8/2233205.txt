Examples of traditional auxiliary languages, sometimes called schematic languages, are Esperanto, Ido, and Volap√ºk. Examples of the newer approach, sometimes called naturalistic languages, are Interlingua, Occidental, and Latino Sine Flexione. Only Esperanto and Interlingua are widely used today, although Ido is also in use.
