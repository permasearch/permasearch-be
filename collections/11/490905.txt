Orange County is located in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in IPR.[146] A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.[147] Part of the injected water consists of recycled water, starting as of 1976 with Water Factory 21, which used RO and high lime to clean the water (production capacity of 19,000 m3 per day).[148][149] This plant was de-commissioned in 2004 and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity (265,000 m3 per day with an ultimate capacity of 492,000 m3 per day), under the name of Groundwater Replenishment System.[149][150] This newer scheme uses the newer technological combination of RO, MF, and ultraviolet light with hydrogen peroxide.[149][151] Plans are also underway to further increase the capacity of the system,[150] which already provides up to 20% of the water used by the country.[152]
