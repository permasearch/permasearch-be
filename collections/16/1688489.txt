Lewis begins exploring the house and stumbles upon several creepy-looking puppets, along with Jonathan smashing a wall with an ax. Lewis, frightened, runs away and sees the windows, piano, and a "pet chair" (named Chairy), among other things, coming to life. At this point, Jonathan reveals to Lewis that he is a practicing warlock and that Florence is a witch. The house's previous owner was a sinister warlock named Isaac Izard (Kyle MacLachlan) and his equally wicked wife Selena (Renee Elise Goldsberry). Before Isaac and Selena both died the previous year, they left a clock in the house and Jonathan has been trying to find and discover its purpose. At Lewis's request, Jonathan agrees to teach him how to be a warlock. Lewis learns that to be a legitimate warlock, he must defeat an evil spirit using his own magic. Additionally, Jonathan lets Lewis know that he has only one house rule: never open a specific cabinet in his study.
