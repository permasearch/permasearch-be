Three different wheel designs will be offered—a 20-inch cast aluminum wheel will be standard, and will feature a hollow rim to reduce weight and absorb tire noise. There’s also an optional 20-inch forged aluminum wheel. The Sport package has upgraded 21-inch forged aluminum wheels. As a way to reduce the weight of a spare, the LC will comes standard with run-flat tires. The increased stiffness of reinforced side walls has been factored into the suspension, and will allow for up to 100 mi (160 km) at 50 mph (80 km/h), should the wheel be punctured.[21]
