The addition of Mahone was well received by critics, who often referred to him as Michael's nemesis.[33][34] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Mahone to be "a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick... who's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert-like Mahone."[35] Brian Zoromski from IGN believes that the "strongest portions of 'Manhunt' deal with the introduction of a new character, an FBI Agent named Alexander Mahone, played by the great character actor William Fichtner."[36] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the "wonderful" Fichtner, claiming he "quickly became more appealing than the brooding hero himself".[33] Robert Bianco of USA Today said that Fichtner was a welcome addition to the cast,[31] and Andy Dehnart from MSNBC called Mahone the best new character of the second season.[37]
