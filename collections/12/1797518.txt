Heart catheterization was first performed in 1929 when the German physician Werner Forssmann inserted a plastic tube in his cubital vein and guided it to the right chamber of the heart. He took an x-ray to prove his success and published it on November 5, 1929 with the title "Ãœber die Sondierung des rechten Herzens" (About probing of the right heart).
