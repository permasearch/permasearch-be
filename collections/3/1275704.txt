X announced that he will be taking a small break from social media on July 20, 2017[44] until he came back two weeks later to announce the release date for his upcoming debut album, called 17.[45] Rapper D.R.A.M brought X out at a concert in the Staples Centre during Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. Tour, being the first time that X performed at the arena and the first time he was brought out as an opening act by a mainstream artist.[46] This was following Lamar's comments about rappers using ghostwriters for song lyrics[47] which may have been directed at Drake, whom X was in a rap feud with earlier that year.[48]
