Upon the sudden popularity of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels.[20] Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets.[20] In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store came up with the idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough.[21][22] Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013.[20] The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).[3]
