That night, Lucy wakes up from sleep, hearing someone calling her name. She realises that it is Aslan, who instructs the others to follow him. The children meet Aslan the next morning at the Stone Table, and he takes them to meet the Old Narnians and Prince Caspian. Nikabrik summons a Hag and a Werewolf, intending to resurrect the White Witch so she can kill Miraz; when the children arrive, Nikabrik, the Hag, and the Werewolf are killed, but Caspian is wounded.
