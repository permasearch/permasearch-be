All Mensa groups publish members-only newsletters or magazines, which include articles and columns written by members, and information about upcoming Mensa events. Examples include the American Mensa Bulletin,[27] the British Mensa magazine,[28] Serbian MozaIQ,[29] the Australian TableAus,[30] the Mexican El Mensajero,[31] and the French Contacts.[32] Some local or regional groups have their own newsletter, such as those in the United States, UK, Germany, and France.[citation needed]
