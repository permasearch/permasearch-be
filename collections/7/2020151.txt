A few given names of Arab origin have become popular in the Spanish-speaking world. In Spain, this coincided with a more flexible attitude to non-Catholic names, which were highly discouraged during the first decades of the Francoist dictatorship.[18] Arabic names which have been present in Spain for many decades include Omar or Soraya. Zaida has also become somewhat common, perhaps after Zaida of Seville, mistress or wife of King Alfonso VI of Castile in the 11th century. A number of streets throughout Spain bear the name of this Muslim princess. Zahira and Zaira have also become somewhat common.
