The imprest system ensures that one must document how the petty cash is spent. In a petty cash system, petty cash receipts are written for each amount issued. So, when all of these receipts are totalled at the end of the month and deducted from the opening petty cash float, the calculated value must agree with what is left in the petty cash float. Under the imprest system, only that which is recorded as spent is replenished. Any shortfalls may have to be replenished by the guardian, usually a bookkeeper, of the petty cash float from their own personal resources.
