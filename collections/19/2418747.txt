The venue reopened in December 28, 1993, for the "Reunion Classic", a men's basketball game between the UCLA Bruins and NC State Wolfpack.[5] This game was met with controversy as the Coliseum was not fully complete at the time of the game. City officials paid $200,000 to have firefighters on stand by during the game. The Coliseum and the newly expanded exhibition hall did not meet state and city building codes nor fire regulations, because of incomplete construction.[6] Additionally, the Coliseum did not hold the permits to host the event. This decision resulted in city council firing both the Coliseum manager and its contractors, Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc. (known for the Spectrum Center, BB&T Center (Sunrise) and the Consol Energy Center).[6] It was later determined it would take an additional ten months to have the complex comply with regulations. The city added in additional $20 million to the budget to renovate the Coliseum and the auditorium.[7]
