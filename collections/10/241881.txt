The data vectors       z   a     {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} _{a}}   have unit length. The correlation matrix for the data is given by      r  a b   =   z   a   â‹…   z   b     {\displaystyle r_{ab}=\mathbf {z} _{a}\cdot \mathbf {z} _{b}}  . The correlation matrix can be geometrically interpreted as the cosine of the angle between the two data vectors       z   a     {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} _{a}}   and       z   b     {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} _{b}}  . The diagonal elements will clearly be 1's and the off diagonal elements will have absolute values less than or equal to unity. The "reduced correlation matrix" is defined as
