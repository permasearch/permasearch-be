On April 3, 1998, work began on the William T. Young Library, which was the largest university project at the time of completion.[25] The six-level William T. Young Library was constructed on south campus and the largest book endowment among all public university libraries in the country.[26] William T. Young got his fortune from selling his peanut butter company to Procter & Gamble in 1955. Nine years after the completion of the William T. Young Library, on April 13, 2007, an entire city block of neighborhood homes were demolished and ground was broken for the Biological Pharmaceutical Complex Building, the largest academic building in the state of Kentucky, and one of the largest in the United States.[27]
