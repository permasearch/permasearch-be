Before directly stating that "Wrecking Ball" was originally written with Beyoncé in mind, songwriter Sacha Skarbek tweeted "Beyonce song now becoming a Miley Cyrus song?!! Good/bad? I don't know??!!!!  [sic]" in December 2012.[4] His representative commented that ""Originally, the [songwriting session between Dr. Luke and Sacha] was booked to write a song for Beyoncé. But as the song ['Wrecking Ball'] progressed, the songwriters realized the song would not work for her."[4]
