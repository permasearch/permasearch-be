Fluoride may also prevent cavities in adults of all ages. A 2007 meta-analysis by CDC researchers found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults, about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average).[52] A 2011 European Commission review found that the benefits of water fluoridation for adult in terms of reductions in decay are limited.[16] A 2015 Cochrane review found no conclusive research regarding the effectiveness of water fluoridation in adults.[51] A 2016 review found variable quality evidence that, overall, stopping of community water fluoridation programs was typically followed by an increase in cavities.[53]
