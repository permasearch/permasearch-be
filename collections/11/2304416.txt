Dry lakes are typically formed in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. The largest concentration of dry lakes (nearly 22,000) is in the southern High Plains of Texas and eastern New Mexico.[citation needed] Most dry lakes are small. However, Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, near Potos√≠, the largest salt flat in the world, comprises 4,085 square miles (10,582 square km).[2]
