Walter (Jonathan Goldstein) is Josh's father and Drake and Megan's stepfather. He is a meteorologist for a local TV news program in San Diego, but he is often wrong about the weather. Walter is often clumsy, out of date, and seemingly empty-headed. As a result, he lacks the respect of his stepchildren, who refer to him by his first name. When Megan calls him by his first name, he always asks "When did she start calling me Walter?" and Audrey replies "I don't know." He is also clueless and skeptical in regards to Megan's pranks which have caused the boys a lot of punishments, although starting in the episode "The Demonator", Walter slowly begins to notice Megan's evil ways. A running gag involves a rivalry between him and Bruce Winchill, an unseen weatherman from another station. He hates that Winchill is so popular, as he is always right with his predictions, and even forbids the use of Winchill's name in the family home.
