The "Dirty War" (Spanish: Guerra Sucia) was part of Operation Condor, originally planned by the CIA,[83][84] and for which the United States government provided technical support and supplied military aid to  during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.  The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime.[85][86][87] Victims of the state terrorism included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 victims, included left-wing activists and militants, trade unionists, students, journalists, Marxists, Peronist guerrillas[88] and alleged sympathizers. The guerrillas, whose number of victims are nearly 500â€“540 between military and police officials[89] and up to 230 civilians[90] were already inactive in 1976, so instead of a war the actual situation was a genocide practiced by the Junta over the civilian population.
