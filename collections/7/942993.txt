Additional color primaries can widen the color gamut of a display, as you are not limited to the shape of a triangle in the CIE 1931 color space.  Recent technologies such as Texas Instruments's BrilliantColor augment the typical red, green, and blue channels with up to three other primaries: cyan, magenta and yellow.[28] Mitsubishi and Samsung, among others, use this technology in some TV sets to extend the range of displayable colors.[citation needed] The Sharp Aquos line of televisions has introduced Quattron technology, which augments the usual RGB pixel components with a yellow subpixel. However, formats and media supporting these extended color primaries are extremely uncommon.
