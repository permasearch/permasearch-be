Because the Bloc was the official opposition, it had considerable privileges over the other parties although all of its MPs had been elected in one province.  For instance, Question Periods during the 35th Parliament were dominated by issues of national unity.  However, the governing Liberals regarded Reform as their main opposition on non-Quebec matters.  Also, in 1995, when Bouchard garnered an invitation to meet visiting US President Bill Clinton by virtue of being Opposition Leader, Reform leader Preston Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard's separatist leverage.[30]
