In the early twentieth century, biologists thought that proteins carried genetic information.[4] This was based on the belief that proteins were more complex than DNA.[4] Phoebus Levene's influential "tetranucleotide hypothesis", which incorrectly proposed that DNA was a repeating set of identical nucleotides, supported this conclusion.[5] The results of the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment, published in 1944, suggested that DNA was the genetic material, but there was still some hesitation within the general scientific community to accept this, which set the stage for the Hershey–Chase experiment.[4][6]
