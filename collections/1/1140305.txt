His fortunes apparently change when he stumbles upon a millionaire drunk by the roadside. He abducts and takes the millionaire in his room alongside a roof terrace in a dilapidated old building. He assumes his identity to taste the opulence and starts staying at the plush five star hotel suite rented by the wealthy millionaire.
