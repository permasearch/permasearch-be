In the 2015 Indian Premier League auction, Kevin Pietersen was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 2 Crore Rupees.[73] However, Pietersen was released by Sunrisers Hyderabad prior to the start of the tournament,[74] although he could play in the latter stages of the 2015 Indian Premier League season.[75] Instead, Pietersen rejoined Surrey, to play County Championship matches,[75] with an aim of playing for England again,[76] although new England director Andrew Strauss said that he wouldn't happen.[77] In May 2015, Pietersen scored his highest first-class score of 355*,[78] before injury prevented him going to the IPL.[79]
