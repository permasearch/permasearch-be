Edward Stratemeyer himself is believed to have written the first volume in its original form in 1904.[1] When the original series was brought to its conclusion in 1979, it had reached a total of 72 volumes. At least two attempts to restart the series were launched after this, but neither effort saw the popularity that the original series achieved.
