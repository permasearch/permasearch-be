With a pH of approximately 2, chyme emerging from the stomach is very acidic. The duodenum secretes a hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the gall bladder to contract, releasing alkaline bile into the duodenum. CCK also causes the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The duodenum is a short section of the small intestine located between the stomach and the rest of the small intestine. The duodenum also produces the hormone secretin to stimulate the pancreatic secretion of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate, which then raises pH of the chyme to 7. The chyme then enters the jejunum, where the useful portion of it is transformed into chyle. (As the material moves through the jejunum and ileum, digestion progresses, and the nonuseful portion will continue onward into the large intestine.) The duodenum is protected by a thick layer of mucus and the neutralizing actions of the sodium bicarbonate and bile.
