Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered insurance against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of fear is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.[53] Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip. See Morewedge and Kahneman (2010), for a recent summary of attribute substitution.[52]
