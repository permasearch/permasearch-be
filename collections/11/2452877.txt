Since the expansion of the EU on 1 May 2004, the UK has accepted immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus, although the substantial Maltese and Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriot communities were established earlier through their Commonwealth connection. There are restrictions on the benefits that members of eight of these accession countries ('A8' nationals) can claim, which are covered by the Worker Registration Scheme.[43] Many other European Union member states exercised their right to temporary immigration control (which ended in 2011)[44] over entrants from these accession states,[45] but some subsequently removed these restrictions ahead of the 2011 deadline.[46]
