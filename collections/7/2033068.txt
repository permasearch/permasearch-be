The second generation, build series W451 (internally: C 451, Coupé – A 451, Cabrio), was introduced in November 2006—its length increased by 200 mm to 2,690 mm (106.1 in) and offering improved crash performance. The second generation retained the interchangeable plastic body panels as well as the prominent exposed, rigid steel safety cell, which is 50% high-strength steel, hot-dip galvanised and powder-coated—and marketed as Tridion.
