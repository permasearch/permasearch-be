The Constitution of New York is the foremost source of state law. The legislation of the New York State Legislature is published in the official Laws of New York and codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York. State agency rules and regulations are promulgated in the New York State Register and compiled in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. Because New York is a common law state, every opinion, memorandum, and motion sent by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court is published in the New York Reports and Appellate Division Reports, respectively, and selected opinions of the trial courts and Supreme Court appellate terms are published in the Miscellaneous Reports. Each local government may also adopt local laws, and counties, cities, and towns may promulgate ordinances.
