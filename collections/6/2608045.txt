In old China, the status of women in both family and society is extremely low. Women are mostly served as trading objects and reproduction tools and they should not only submit to her husband, but also totally submit to her grown son. In this extreme patriarchal society, foot-binding was created. Foot-binding is a procedure that break bones in women’s foot and bind it to fit in a three-inches long shoe, called “Lotus Shoes”.[7] This procedure is “a voluntary ordeal undertaken by mothers to inform their daughters of how to succeed in a world authored by men” and “it informed a daughter of the necessity of sacrificing the products of her body in service to the Neo-Confucian family system.”[7] All these descriptions of foot-binding still might not fully present the true cruelty and sexual depravity of foot-binding and patriarchy in old Chinese society. The following paragraphs will discuss more details about foot-binding’s origin, cruelty of the procedure and the reasons for following this tradition.
