His cousin Laonicus Chalcondyles (c. 1423–1490) was also a native of Athens, a notable scholar and Byzantine historian and one of the most valuable of the later Greek historians. He was the author of the valuable work Historiarum Demonstrationes (Demonstrations of History) and was a great admirer of the ancient writer Herodotus, encouraging the interest of contemporary Italian humanists in that ancient historian.[32] In the 17th century, Athenian-born Leonardos Philaras (c. 1595–1673),[33] was a Greek scholar, politician, diplomat, advisor and the Duke of Parma's ambassador to the French court,[34] spending much of his career trying to persuade western European intellectuals to support Greek independence.[35][36]
