In an advanced, industrial, capitalist society, the complex system of division of labor means that people are allocated in society according to merit and rewarded accordingly: social inequality reflects natural inequality, assuming that there is complete equity in the society. Durkheim argued that moral regulation was needed, as well as economic regulation, to maintain order (or organic solidarity) in society with people able to "compose their differences peaceably."[2] In this type of society, law would be more restitutive than penal, seeking to restore rather than punish excessively.
