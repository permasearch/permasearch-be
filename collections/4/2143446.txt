Since the SR&ED program is a tax credit administered by the Canadian government, several firms provide financing to claimants, that is secured by anticipated receipt of their tax credits, for both pre-file and post-file claims. This allows a company expecting a claim to receive funds immediately, rather than the possible 120-, 240- or 365-day processing times outlined by the CRA.
