Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.[1][6] People with latent TB do not spread the disease.[1] Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke.[1] Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.[7] Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.[7]
