The Schwinn Bicycle Company was founded by German-born mechanical engineer Ignaz Schwinn (1860â€“1945) in Chicago in 1895.[2][3] It became the dominant manufacturer of American bicycles through most of the 20th century. After declaring bankruptcy in 1992, Schwinn has since been a sub-brand of Pacific Cycle, owned by the multi-national conglomerate, Dorel Industries.[4]
