Upon its premiere, viewers criticised the complexity of the format, and noted a continuity error which revealed the outcome of the first episode at the start of the show.[6] Chaser Paul Sinha took to social media shortly after the episode aired and described the first episode of Cash Trapped as "weird".[7] Frances Taylor of BT said that the show was "somewhat enjoyable. And if nothing else, the concept was innovative and offered something different to the majority of quiz shows on television right now. But will Cash Trapped become as popular and well-loved as Bradley Walsh’s other quiz vehicle? We doubt it. The beauty of The Chase is not only the thrill of, well, the chase – but also in the interactions between the Chasers, the contestants and Walsh himself. Cash Trapped was certainly enjoyable, but it wasn’t a classic."[8] Cash Trapped was however the best rating replacement for The Chase since Tipping Point, and the show was renewed for a second series.
