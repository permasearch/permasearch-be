During the 2013 NBA Playoffs, the Oklahoma City Thunder were using the song "Can't Hold Us"[12] to pump up the crowd during their home games at Chesapeake Energy Arena. Macklemore, a Seattle native and fan of the former Seattle SuperSonics, requested that the Thunder, who moved from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008, not play the song. The Thunder obliged.[13]
