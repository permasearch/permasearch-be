Womenâ€™s archery was a varsity sport at Texas A&M from 1999 to 2004. It was added in 1999 when the NCAA designated archery as an emerging varsity sport for women. Archery was cut from varsity status in 2004, however, due in part to the lack of growth of varsity NCAA programs at other universities. Archery now continues at Texas A&M as a club sport.
