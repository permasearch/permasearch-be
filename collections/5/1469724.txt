The complex is also home to three entertainment areas. CNN's studios in the Time Warner Center, are one of the network's three primary broadcast sites (along with facilities in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles). Shows which originate from the New York facility include Anderson Cooper 360Â° and Erin Burnett OutFront. CNN's Jeanne Moos, known for her offbeat "man on the street" reporting, frequently accosts her interview subjects just outside the building. In 2005, Jazz at Lincoln Center announced a partnership with XM Satellite Radio which gave XM studio space at Frederick P. Rose Hall to broadcast both daily jazz programming and special events such as the Artist Confidential show featuring Carlos Santana.[20][21] Anderson Cooper's daytime talk show, Anderson recorded in Jazz at Lincoln Center's The Allen Room for a year before moving elsewhere.
