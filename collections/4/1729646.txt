The name Vladivostok loosely translates from Russian as "ruler of the East" (imperative of the verb vladet′ [владеть] plus vostok [Восток]) —a name similar to that of the Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz which means "ruler of the Caucasus" and which was first used in 1784. The unofficial nickname of the city is Vladik (Владик).[citation needed] Vladivostok was first named in 1859 along with other features in the Peter the Great Gulf area by Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky. The name first applied to the bay but, following an expedition by Alexey Shefner in 1860, was applied to the new settlement.[11]
