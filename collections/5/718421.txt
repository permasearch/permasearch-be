Most the craniofacial characteristics are influenced by the both genetic and environmental factors through complex interactions. The variable expressivity of traits can be either completely genetic determined, environmental determined or both. The multiplicity of hypodontia theories suggest that missing teeth are strongly influenced by genetic factor. Although single gene defect may contribute to the cause of hypodontia, but more studies propose that hypodontia is mainly the result of one or more point of genetic mutations which are closely linked, which is known as polygenic defect.[50][51][52]
