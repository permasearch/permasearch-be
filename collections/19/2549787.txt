Monroe and Miller separated after filming wrapped up, and she was granted a quick divorce in Mexico in January 1961.[221] The Misfits was released the following month, but it failed at the box office.[222] Its reviews were mixed,[222] with Variety complaining of frequently "choppy" character development,[223] and Bosley Crowther calling Monroe "completely blank and unfathomable" and stating that "unfortunately for the film's structure, everything turns upon her".[224] Despite the film's initial failure, it has received more favorable reviews from critics and film scholars in the twenty-first century. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called it a classic,[225] Huston scholar Tony Tracy has described Monroe's performance the "most mature interpretation of her career",[226] and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent has praised her for being "extraordinary" in portraying Roslyn's "power of empathy".[227]
