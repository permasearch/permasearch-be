The SI system defines the coulomb in terms of the ampere and second: 1 C = 1 A × 1 s.[3] The second is defined in terms of a frequency naturally emitted by caesium atoms.[4] The ampere is defined using Ampère's force law;[5] the definition relies in part on the mass of the international prototype kilogram, a metal cylinder housed in France.[6] In practice, the Kibble balance is used to measure amperes with the highest possible accuracy.[6]
