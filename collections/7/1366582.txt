"You Win Again" is a 1987 song written by Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb and performed by the Bee Gees. Released as a single in late 1987, it marked the start of the group's comeback, becoming a No. 1 hit in many European countries, including the UKâ€”their first to do so in over eight years, and made them the first group to score a UK No. 1 hit in each of three decades: the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.[1]
