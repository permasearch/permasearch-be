He is notable for being the owner of Jason's original hockey mask. Shelly tries an unsuccessful advance on Vera but is rejected. Angered by Vera spurning him, Shelly later sneaks up on her at the Crystal Lake dock, wielding a harpoon while wearing a wetsuit and hockey mask, intending to scare her. After being frightened by Shelly, an enraged Vera tells Shelly that she would like him more if he did not act like a "jerk," which Shelly responds to by saying that "being a jerk is better than being a nothing" before walking to a nearby barn where the hiding Jason Voorhees slits his throat off-screen and takes his hockey mask and harpoon. Shelly tries to get help from friend Chili, who thinks that he is pulling another trick, but eventually dies from his wound.
