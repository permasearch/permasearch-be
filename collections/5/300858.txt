A "podetium" (plural: podetia) is a lichenized stalk-like structure of the fruiting body rising from the thallus, associated with some fungi that produce a fungal apothecium.[28] Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent.[28] The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. They usually bear the fungal pycnidia or apothecia or both.[28] Many lichens have apothecia that are visible to the naked eye.[2]
