"One Last Time" is a dance-pop and EDM-light song,[17][18] with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17).[5] Its instrumentations consist in "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line".[19] "One Last Time" is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6.[20] Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new.[21] As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope,"[19] with the singer pleading, "One last time/I need to be the one who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go".[21] Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song " reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song "Euphoria".[17]
