In the early Victorian period, two young child cousins, Richard (Glenn Kohan) and Emmeline Lestrange (Elva Josephson), and a galley cook, Paddy Button (Leo McKern), survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and reach a lush tropical island. Paddy cares for the small children and forbids them by "Law" from going to the other side of the island, as he had found remains from bloody human sacrifices on an Easter Island-like altar. He also warns them against eating a scarlet berry which is apparently deadly (he calls it the "never-wake-up berry").
