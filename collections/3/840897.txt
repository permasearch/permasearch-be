Another option is to separate a small portion of the reservoir by constructing a weir up to 510 feet (155 m) MSL along with an underground pumping station at 16°37′21″N 79°16′01″E﻿ / ﻿16.62250°N 79.26694°E﻿ / 16.62250; 79.26694﻿ (Underground pumping station) to maintain gravity flow to the left bank canal side from the lower level dead storage water of the main reservoir. When the reservoir water level is above 510 ft MSL, the weir would get submerged and water flows to left canal without any pumping as usual.
