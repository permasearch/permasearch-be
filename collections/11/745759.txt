Sentencing Options 42(2)(h) Section 42 (2) (h) under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is a non- custodial sentencing option that states that the Youth Justice Court (YJC) may order a young offender to compensate the victim in kind or by personal service for a damage, loss, or injury suffered.[121] Under 42 (2) (h), an order may be made under section 42 (2) (g) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the purchaser of a stolen property since the stolen property had to be returned to the owner, or section 42 (2) (e) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the victim for personal injury or property that was damaged.[122] The YJC may arrange the times and terms of compensation that is ordered. However, the compensation must not conflict with the young offenderâ€™s regular schedule of education and work.[123] The order to provide personal service to the victim can be assigned for any amount of hours but is limited up to 240 hours.[123] The hours of service ordered can be completed within one year from the date which the sentencing option was ordered; however the YJC may allow an extension of time to fully complete the sentence, on application of the young offender.[123] Although the YJC may order the young offender to compensate the victim by providing personal service, the consent of the compensated is required.[124]
