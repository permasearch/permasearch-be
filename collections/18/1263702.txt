Efforts such as early childhood intervention, screening for common problems, medical treatment where indicated, a good family environment, and work-related training can improve the development of children with Down syndrome. Education and proper care can improve quality of life.[5] Raising a child with Down syndrome is more work for parents than raising an unaffected child.[90] Typical childhood vaccinations are recommended.[19]
