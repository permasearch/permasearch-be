Also that month, Buckingham departed the group a second time, reportedly by way of dismissal.[76] The cause was said to be disagreement about the nature of the tour,[77] in particular centering on whether newer or less well known material might be included per Buckinghamâ€™s desire.[78] Mick Fleetwood and the band appeared on CBS This Morning on 25 April 2018 and said that Buckingham would not sign off on a Tour that the group had been planning for a year and a half. He said that they had reached a "huge impasse" and "hit a brick wall." When asked if Buckingham had been fired, Fleetwood said, "Well, we don't use that word because I think it's ugly." He also said that "Lindsey has huge amounts of respect and kudos to what he's done within the ranks of Fleetwood Mac and always will."[79]
