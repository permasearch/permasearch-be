In 2005, Lexus completed an organizational separation from parent company Toyota,[63] with dedicated design, engineering, training, and manufacturing centers working exclusively for the division.[64][65] This effort coincided with Lexus' launch in its home market of Japan and an expanded global launch of the brand in markets such as China.[65][66] Executives aimed to increase Lexus sales outside of its largest market in the U.S.[65][67] To accompany this expansion, next generation Lexus vehicles were redesigned as "global models" for international release.[68] In the European market, where Lexus had long faced struggling sales owing to low brand recognition, few dedicated dealerships, and 1990s import quotas,[69][70] the marque announced plans to introduce hybrid and diesel powertrains,[71] increase the number of Lexus dealerships, and expand operations in emerging markets such as Russia.[72][73]
