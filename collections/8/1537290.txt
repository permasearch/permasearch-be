Meanwhile, one of the ship's watchstanding engineers is killed by Kryton, chief of Elaan's bodyguards, who is secretly working for the Klingons. Kryton sabotages the dilithium crystals that control the Enterprise's warp engines and tries to contact the Klingon battle cruiser. He is captured, but commits suicide before he can be interrogated. Elaan explains Kryton was from a noble family and had loved her. The arranged marriage had infuriated him and he sold out to the Klingons, probably hoping to disrupt the planetary alliance so he could marry her.
