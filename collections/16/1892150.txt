Fernand Braudel remarked, "Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution".[10] In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic countinghouse of France. (Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air.) When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France. In the later 1400s and 1500s Lyon was an key centre of literary activity, both of French writers (Maurice Scève, Antoine Heroet, Louise Labé) and of Italians in exile (Luigi Alamanni, Giorgio Trissinio), for book publishing and of protestant activity.
