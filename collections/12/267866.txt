Fending off the German invasion and pressing to victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War required a tremendous sacrifice by the Soviet Union (more than any other country in human history). Soviet military casualties totaled approximately 35 million (official figures 28.2 million) with approximately 14.7 million killed, missing or captured (official figures 11.285 million).[178] Although figures vary, the Soviet civilian death toll probably reached 22 million.[178] Millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians disappeared into German detention camps and slave labour factories, while millions more suffered permanent physical and mental damage.[178] Economic losses, including losses in resources and manufacturing capacity in western Russia and Ukraine, were also catastrophic.[178] The war resulted in the destruction of approximately 70,000 Soviet cities, towns and villages.[179] Destroyed in that process were 6 million houses, 98,000 farms, 32,000 factories, 82,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 6,000 hospitals and thousands of kilometres of roads and railway track.[179]
