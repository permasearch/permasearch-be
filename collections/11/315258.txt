2004â€” On December 3, 2004, IDEA was amended by the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, now known as IDEIA. Several provisions aligned IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized fifteen states to implement 3-year IEPs on a trial basis when parents continually agree. Drawing on the report of the President's Commission on Excellence in Special Education,[46] the law revised the requirements for evaluating children with learning disabilities. More concrete provisions relating to discipline of special education students were also added. (Pub. L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647).
