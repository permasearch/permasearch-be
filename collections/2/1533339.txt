"Fall for Your Type" is a downtempo ballad, with a length of four minutes and thirty-one seconds (4:31).[4] August Brown cited the song as being a "lovers' rock for a techno dystopia".[5] The song contains an "icy cold", hip hop landscape.[6] "Fall for Your Type" is a "somber track", in which Foxx "drops into a pained purr and gives guest Drake a run for his melancholy-player money."[7]
