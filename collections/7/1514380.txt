Better Call Saul revolves around the life of Jimmy McGill around 2002, prior to (and, to a limited extent, after) the events of Breaking Bad. McGill starts the series as a talented but unsuccessful lawyer overshadowed by his older brother Chuck,[2] working closely with his fellow attorney and on-off partner Kim Wexler.[3] The first season follows his attempts to transform himself from a con man to a legitimate lawyer, while cutting ethical corners and facing roadblocks from Chuck.[4] He adopts the alias "Saul Goodman" during the third season of the series, though not as an attorney, but as a TV commercial producer.[5]
