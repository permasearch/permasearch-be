Philippine independence was recognized by the United States on July 4, 1946. After independence in 1946, Filipino American numbers continued to grow. Immigration was reduced significantly during the 1930s, except for those who served in the United States Navy, and increased following immigration reform in the 1960s.[18] The population of Filipino immigrant workers, as well the quality of their skills, improved following the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965.[17]
