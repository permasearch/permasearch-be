The first known mention of this word is in a letter from Cicero in 56 B.C. Cicero uses the word to mean simplicity (or frugality) of life. Over time, the meaning and the function of the word changed from 'simple' to the idea of understatement that involves double negatives. Early litotes began with two words, mainly a positive and a negative connected by a particle. This gave the word two meanings. After the redundancy, the positive part can be omitted. Due to the feeling of the phrase the reader must then work with the author or speaker to understand the meaning.
