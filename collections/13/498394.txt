He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[4] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[4] and a favorite little nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton.[4] Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who would like nothing better than to live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in far-away adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written as though they are autobiographical adventure stories.
