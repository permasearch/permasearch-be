In the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, "G major is often a key of 6 8 chain rhythms", according to Alfred Einstein,[2] although Bach also used the key for some 4 4-based works, including his third and fourth Brandenburg Concertos. Pianist Jeremy Denk observes that the Goldberg Variations are 80 minutes in G major.[3]
