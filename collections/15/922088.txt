Texas Roadhouse serves American cuisine, including steak, ribs, chicken, and seafood. Their main suppliers are JBS Swift and Smithfield Foods.[10] The chain boasts several cooking championships across the country with their ribs and steaks. The menu follows a theme of mushrooms, cheese, and barbecue. Everything on the menu is made from scratch, with the exception of children's menu items Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, applesauce, and hot dogs. This includes the salads and dressings (the only dressing not made from scratch is low-fat ranch), sauces and side dishes. Their steaks are hand-cut (with the exception of the Porterhouse T-bone steaks, which are cut off-site and vacuum-packed) and are never frozen.[citation needed]
