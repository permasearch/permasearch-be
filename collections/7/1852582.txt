The Seraikella Chhau's technique and repertoire were developed by the erstwhile nobility of this region who were both its performers and choreographers, and in the modern era people from all backgrounds dance it.[7] The Seraikella Chhau is performed with symbolic masks, and the acting establishes the role the actor is playing.[7][12] The Purulia Chhau uses extensive masks shaped in the form of the character being played; for example, a lion character has a face mask of lion and body costumes too with the actor walking on all fours.[7] These masks are crafted by potters who make clay images of Hindu gods and goddesses and is primarily sourced from the Purulia district of West Bengal.[13] In the Mayurbhanj Chhau is performed without masks and is technically similar to the Seraikella Chhau.[7][12]
