The pain associated with the procedure is not caused by the insertion of the scope but rather by the inflation of the colon in order to do the inspection.  The scope itself is essentially a long, flexible tube about a centimeter in diameter, i.e. as big around as the little finger, which is less than the diameter of an average stool.
