After the 2016 WWE Hall of Fame class had been presented, Charlotte, Becky Lynch, and Sasha Banks (who had her cousin and newly-minted WWE Hall of Famer Snoop Dogg perform her entrance theme while accompanying her to the ring) wrestled in a Triple Threat match. Originally promoted as being for Charlotte's WWE Divas Championship, the match would instead determine the new WWE Women's Champion as the Divas title would be retired. The ending saw Lynch execute a fisherman suplex from the top rope on Charlotte, who rolled to the floor. Banks then applied the Bank Statement on Lynch but Charlotte threw Banks out of the ring. Charlotte applied the Figure-Eight Leglock on Lynch while Ric Flair (Charlotte's father and manager) prevented Banks from intervening. Lynch submitted, giving the win and the WWE Women's title to Charlotte.
