Gender loss began in the north of England; the south-east and the south-west Midlands were the most linguistically conservative regions, and Kent retained traces of gender in the 1340s.[4] Late 14th-century London English had almost completed the shift away from grammatical gender,[4] and Modern English retains no morphological agreement of words with grammatical gender.[7]
