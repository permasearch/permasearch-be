The most common source of ethylene glycol is automotive antifreeze or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high.[9] Other sources of ethylene glycol include windshield deicing agents, brake fluid, motor oil, developing solutions for hobby photographers, wood stains, solvents, and paints.[9] Some people put antifreeze into their cabinâ€™s toilet to prevent it from freezing during the winter, resulting in toxicities when animals drink from the toilet.[9] Small amounts of ethylene glycol may be contained in holiday ornaments such as snow globes.[9]
