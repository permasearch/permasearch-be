Cheat codes are usually activated by typing secret passwords or pressing controller buttons in a certain sequence.[11] Less common activation methods include entering certain high score names, holding keys or buttons while dying, picking up items in a particular order and otherwise performing unintuitive actions. Some games may also offer a debug console that can be used to edit game parameters. Effects might include unlocking a character or improving a character's performance: for example providing a car with greater acceleration,[11] entering god mode or noclip mode, unlimited money or ammunition, or just visual gags with no practical purpose, such as "Tutu Qwark" in Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal.
