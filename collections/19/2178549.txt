Johnson started the first two games of 1998 for the Vikings, both victories. In the season opener, a 31-7 win over Tampa Bay, Johnson threw for 4 touchdowns and 1 interception over 189 yards and completed 15 of 25 passes.[8] However, Johnson would complete only 18 of 31 passes the following game and throw for 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions before leaving the game during the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle.[8][20] Randall Cunningham replaced Johnson, and Minnesota won Week 2 (September 13) over the St. Louis Rams 38-31. By Week 8, with Cunningham as starter, the Vikings had a perfect 7-0 record.[21] Johnson returned to action in Week 9 (November 8), in a 31-24 win over the New Orleans Saints, after Cunningham injured his knee. With 28-for-38 passing over 316 yards, Johnson had one passing touchdown and 2 interceptions. However, Johnson broke his thumb in the first play of the third quarter.[8][22] Cunningham returned as starter the following week, and Johnson next played in the Week 15 50-10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Minnesota finished the 1998 season a franchise-best 15â€“1 and advanced to the NFC championship game, where they came a field goal short of the Super Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons. Following the season, Vikings coach Dennis Green formally named Randall Cunningham as starting quarterback and traded Brad Johnson to the Washington Redskins for a first, a future second, and a third-round draft pick.[23]
