Hill served an engineering apprenticeship at the government workshops in Islington.[2] On retirement from cricket, however, Hill began a career in horse racing administration. He was employed as a stipendiary steward with the South Australian Jockey Club and the Adelaide Racing Club and in 1937 he was appointed handicapper for the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (VATC) in Melbourne.[5] At the VATC he was responsible for setting the weights for the Caulfield Cup, one of Australia's richest and most prestigious horse races.[3] He served in this role for six years before poor health saw him take a less demanding role at the Geelong Racing Club.[3]
