Creighton's original name was Anderson Duke.[37] Additionally, cut dialogue was to reveal that Creighton's obsession with Jason stemmed from him witnessing Jason kill his girlfriend while the two were out boating on Crystal Lake. Adam Marcus, the director of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, has said that he believes Creighton to be, after Jason, the best character in the Friday the 13th series, also stating Creighton "is the flip side of the Jason coin. A sadistic psychotic who happens to be sort of a hero or at least an enemy of Jason"[38]
