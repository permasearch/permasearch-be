It is revealed that Yennefer survived her escape from the Lodge and took refuge in Skellige, requesting aid from the yarl, Crach an Craite, with whom she has a romantic past, and who knew Ciri in her youth. Crach aids her out of loyalty, and Yennefer gains the help of the Priestesses of Freya, led by the faithful Sigrdrifa, in order to gather information on Vilgefortz's plans and attempt to find him. During her time here, she has a vision of Ragh Nar Roog, the end of the world, and is urged by what appears to be the mythical Modron Freya to choose a side. She ultimately learns that Vilgefortz may have teleported into a dangerous part of the sea beyond Skellige, and travels there, where she is apparently consumed in a maelstrom, the ship accompanying her destroyed.
