In the mid-to-late 1990s, when AW was in its final ratings slump, many affiliates swapped AW's time slot with Days of Our Lives, which usually aired an hour earlier. Other affiliates transferred AW to their morning schedule. One station, KXAS, aired AW on a different local channel that had a programming and promotion agreement with KXAS, for a time in the late 1990s.
