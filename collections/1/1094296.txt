Zombies have overrun the entire world, outnumbering humans 400,000 to 1. The remaining live humans live in barricaded camps and secure underground bunkers. In an underground facility in the Everglades that houses scientists and soldiers, the scientists are trying to find a solution to the zombie pandemic, in exchange for the soldiers to protect them and to facilitate their work. Dr. Sarah Bowman (Lori Cardille), her boyfriend Private Miguel Salazar (Anthony Dileo Jr.), radio operator Bill McDermott (Jarlath Conroy), and helicopter pilot John (Terry Alexander) fly from their underground base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They encounter a large horde of the undead and return to their army base.
