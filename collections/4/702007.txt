Stars visible to the unaided eye have their magnitude shown in light blue below. Brown dwarfs are shown with their designations in brown. White dwarfs are shown with their designation in beige. The classes of the stars and brown dwarfs are shown in the color of their spectral types (these colors are derived from conventional names for the spectral types and do not represent the star's observed color). Many brown dwarfs are not listed by visual magnitude but are listed by near-IR J band magnitude. Some of the parallax and distance results are preliminary measurements.[2]
