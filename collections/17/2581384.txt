In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist, when he is about thirty years old. Jesus then begins preaching in Galilee and gathers disciples.[31][32] After the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, three of the disciples witness his Transfiguration.[33][34] After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there.[35] Jesus makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and once there friction with the Pharisees increases and one of his disciples agrees to betray him for thirty pieces of silver.[36][37][38]
