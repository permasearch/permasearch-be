The FHD or Full HD resolution of 1920×1080 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio was developed as an HDTV transmission and storage format. Using interlacing, the bandwidth requirements are very similar to those of 720p – their pixel counts are roughly in a 2:1 ratio, 9:4 exactly. FHD is 3 times the width and ​2 1⁄4 times the height of 4:3 VGA. This resolution is often referred to as 1080p (although screens that use interlacing instead of progressive scan are more accurately referred to as 1080i).
