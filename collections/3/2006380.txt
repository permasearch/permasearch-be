One, Two, Three was banned in Finland from 1962 to 1986 on "political" grounds â€” it was feared that the film would harm relations between Finland and the Soviet Union.[15] United Pictures Finland tried to get the film released theatrically in 1962, 1966 and 1969 but it was only in 1986 that the Finnish Board of Film Classification allowed the film to be distributed.
