After the release of Batman Forever, Warner Bros. started development on Batman & Robin, commissioning it on fast track for an adamant June 1997 release.[35] Val Kilmer did not return, because of scheduling conflicts with The Saint,[36] and was replaced by George Clooney. Arnold Schwarzenegger starred as Mr. Freeze, while Uma Thurman starred as Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone starred as Batgirl. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin. Principal photography began in September 1996[37] and finished in January 1997,[38] two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.[39] Batman & Robin was released on June 20, 1997, and received primarily negative reviews.[40] Observers criticized the film for its toyetic and campy approach, and for homosexual innuendos added by Schumacher.[36] Still, the film was a financial success,[41] but remains to be the least commercially successful live-action Batman film ever. Batman & Robin received numerous nominations at the Razzie Awards[42] and ranks among the worst rated superhero films of all time.[43][44]
