Celentano performed the song at least twice on Italian television. In one broadcast, he dances with Raffaella Carr√†, who lip-synchs to Mori's vocals. In a second broadcast, the song appears in a comedy sketch in which he portrays a teacher. Video clips of both performances, both separate and edited together, began to appear on YouTube in the late 2000s. It became something of an Internet meme,[4] and in 2009 it was posted to Boing Boing,[5] and subsequently saw renewed interest in the Italian media.[6]
