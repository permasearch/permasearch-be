The British expansion plans ultimately amounted to nothing. MGM closed its online casino after less than two years, citing uncertainty in American regulations and competition from established British brands.[102] The Wembley acquisition turned into a bidding war, with MGM finally losing out to an investors group including Kerzner International.[103] The Triangle Casino was sold off to Stanley Leisure in 2006.[104] The company's other development plans were scuttled as the government scaled down, and eventually abandoned, the plan to allow large "super-casinos".[105][106]
