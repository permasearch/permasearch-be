The French Alps are the portions of the Alps mountain range that stand within France, located in the Rh么ne-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-C么te d'Azur regions. While some of the ranges of the French Alps are entirely in France, others, such as the Mont Blanc massif, are shared with Switzerland and/or Italy.
