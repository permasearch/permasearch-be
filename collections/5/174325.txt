The album was auctioned to the highest bidder through auction house Paddle8 in 2015. A winning bid for the album was accepted by the Wu-Tang Clan on May 3, 2015, and was followed by months of legal diligence. Due to the unprecedented nature of the sale, new and unique legal structures were written for the sales agreement. The sale was completed on August 26, 2015, at a price "in the millions" to a "private American collector".[10] On December 9, 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek identified the buyer as controversial Turing pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli.[11] In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, RZA noted that the sale had been agreed upon before Shkreli's controversial price hike of Daraprim, an anti-infective agent most commonly used in immunocompromised patients with toxoplasmosis. In the statement, RZA added that the group had donated a "significant portion" of the proceeds to charity upon hearing who the buyer was.[12] Among the charities Wu-Tang Clan donated to were the Children's Literacy Society, the Hip Hop Chess Federation and TTAC, an institution focused on showcasing alternative cures for cancer.[13] The actual sale price was never revealed by the auction house or the Wu-Tang Clan, but Bloomberg reported[11] and Shkreli later confirmed[14] that he had purchased the album for $2 million.
