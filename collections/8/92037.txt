In the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom, show five and the Grand Final which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004.[20][21] In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to "logistical problems".[22] In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, "the atmosphere was electric. It's huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool." Eventually, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, for series 7, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009.[23] Strictly Come Dancing returned to Blackpool for the 2010[24] and 2011 series.[25] Then after series 10 when Strictly Come Dancing did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11.[26]
