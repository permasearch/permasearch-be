Lee Janzen won at Olympic in 1998 with a score of 280 (even par, as the course played a par 70 for the U.S. Open). Players complained about the pin position at the 18th hole in the second round. The pin was set at the top of a ridge, and, many balls rolled on way past the cup. Kirk Triplett incurred a two-stroke penalty when he used his putter to stop the ball from rolling. Payne Stewart, the runner-up to Janzen, complained as he three-putted the hole.  The green was flattened around 2000 as a result, but was given more slope in the recent renovation to the course.
