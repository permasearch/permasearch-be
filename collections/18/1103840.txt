Derek Edward Trotter, more commonly known as Del Boy (born 12 July 1945), is the fictional lead character in the popular BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses and one of the main characters of its prequel, Rock & Chips. He was played by David Jason in the original series and was portrayed as a teenager by James Buckley in the prequel. Del Boy is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy characters in the history of British Television, and is regarded as an iconic character in British culture. Encompassing everything Cockney, Del is known for his broken French quotes which are usually completely out of context and a variety of catchphrases, including: "He who dares â€“ wins!", "This time next year we'll be millionaires", "Lovely Jubbly!", "You know it makes sense" (which he usually says to his customers after they have agreed on a deal) and "You plonker!" (which he usually says to Rodney).
