Trinidad and Tobago has an underground pop, rock and heavy metal scene with many small shows being held throughout the year. The largest of such shows is the annual Pop Music Awards held at the Tsunami nightclub in Chaguaramas and the Samaan Tree Rock Festival in Aranguez. Alternative Wednesdays at the Inifiti bar at the University of the West Indies helped develop the scene in the 90s followed by The Filth and the Fury! and antipop in the early 2000s. Alternative rock and heavy metal artists that featured during this period included Oddfellows Local, jointpop, jaundis-I, Smith Tuttle, 12, Big Eyed Grieve, Lucifix, Necropolis, Cobolized, Overdose, Tripped and Falling, Babylon Zoo, High Society, Astral Garden, Brown Fox, Bleed, Orange Peel Groove and Orange Sky.
