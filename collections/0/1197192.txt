On August 31, 2001 the Chromate Toxicity Review Committee—which then included Russell Flegal, Jerold Last, Ernest E. McConnell from ToxPath, Marc Schenker and Hanspeter Witschi—submitted their report entitled "Scientific Review of Toxicological and Human Health Issues Related to the Development of a Public Health Goal for Chromium(VI)."[21][23] The blue-ribbon academic committee recommended that reports of chromium concentrations especially in Southern California were alarmist and "spuriously high" and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators.[21]:29 Their report cited both the 1987 Zhang article and the retracted 1997 version.[9][10][11][13]
