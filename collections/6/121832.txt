Since July 1997, the responsibility of maintaining the military forces in Hong Kong has been transferred from the British Armed Forces to China's PLA Hong Kong Garrison under the Liberation Army. The garrison, consisting of units from ground, naval and air forces, reports its command to the Central Military Commission.
