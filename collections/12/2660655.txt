The recording took place at the Beatles' Apple Studio, according to the album's sleeve credits,[64] although Voormann maintains that Harrison's new home studio, FPSHOT, was the main location.[65] Harrison had intended to co-produce with Spector as before,[66] but he became the album's sole producer due to Spector's unreliability.[67] Session tapes, since made available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg,[68] reveal that the rock instrumentation on "Living in the Material World" continued, at a reduced volume, over the "spiritual sky" portions originally.[18]
