On the other hand, the San Jose Mercury News writer Tatiana Sanchez reported that some American and South Vietnamese veterans were "angry, (and) disappointed" with the documentary.[13] They characterized it as a "betrayal". She writes: "veterans of the South Vietnamese military say they were largely left out of the narrative, their voices drowned out by the filmâ€™s focus on North Vietnam and its communist leader, Ho Chi Minh. And many American veterans say that the series had several glaring omissions and focused too much on leftist anti-war protesters and soldiers who came to oppose the war."
