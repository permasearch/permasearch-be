The NPS provides parking facilities for bicycles near each of the major memorials as well as along the National Mall.[171] From March to October, an NPS concessionaire rents out bicycles at the Thompson Boat Center, located near the intersection of Virginia Avenue NW and Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, 1 mile (1.6Â km) north of the Lincoln Memorial along the Potomac River-Rock Creek Trail.[171][172] The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the National Mall on March 16, 2012, shortly before the start of the 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival.[173]
