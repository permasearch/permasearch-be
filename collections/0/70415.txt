2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine can be used to qualitatively detect the carbonyl functionality of a ketone or aldehyde functional group. A positive test is signalled by the formation of a yellow, orange or red precipitate (known as a dinitrophenylhydrazone). If the carbonyl compound is aromatic, then the precipitate will be red; if aliphatic, then the precipitate will have a more yellow color.[2] The reaction between 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and a generic ketone to form a hydrazone is shown below:
