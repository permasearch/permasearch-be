John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.[4] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.
