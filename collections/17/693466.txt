Licensing proposals in Northern Ireland were first announced by the Northern Ireland Office in 2004, leading to a consultation in 2005,[9] again very similar to the Scottish and English Acts.  The proposals triggered much initial opposition, even from some parts of the licensed trade.[10][11][12]  These proposals are not currently proceeding.[13]
