The car was carefully chosen, a red Plymouth Valiant, although three cars were used in the actual production of the movie.[8] The original release of Duel featured a 1970 model with a 318 V-8 engine[9] and "Plymouth" spelled out in block letters across the hood, as well as trunk lid treatment characteristic of the 1970 model; a 1971 model with a 225 Slant Six was also used.[10] When the film was released in theaters and scenes were added, a 1972 model with a 225 Slant Six was added, with the "Plymouth" name on the hood as one emblem.
