Detective Arthur "Art" Bradley, who is homosexual, but married with children, is the only surviving witness to a mass-murder in a gay bar; much of the episode revolves around attempts by Washington and LaRue to cover for him, and his eventual decision to come forward formally as a witness.  Goldblume becomes Fay's partner in natural childbirth classes, the "Cisco Kid" (a horse-riding eccentric) causes problems, and Calletano finally passes a kidney stone (with a loud scream) during very hot weather, and a series of city-wide power cuts.
