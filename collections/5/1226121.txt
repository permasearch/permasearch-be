The final was postponed from its scheduled start on Monday at 4 p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30 p.m. because of rain. On Thursday it was still showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators.[t] There was a temporary three-plank stand on one side of the court offering seating to about thirty people.[80][u] Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a quarter of an hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively.[82][83] En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46.[84] Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting.[84][v] Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament.[86]
