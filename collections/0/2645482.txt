In 2004, Lego posted a loss of £174 million, with executive vice-president of marketing Mads Nipper later describing the company as having been "almost bankrupt" at this point.[12] He analysed in retrospect that "we continued to invest as if the company were growing strongly. We failed to realise that we were on a slippery path…. Children were getting less and less time to play. Some of the western markets had fewer and fewer children. So play trends changed, and we failed to change. We were not making toys that were sufficiently interesting to children. We failed to innovate enough. And we had nowhere cut deep enough to right-size the company".[12]
