The main comic book series (simply named Dennis the Menace) ran in tandem with the "Giant" series. The Dennis the Menace Giant Vacation Special[36] and Dennis the Menace Christmas Issue[37] were published by Standard in 1955. Those issues inaugurated the Giants series, which was published by Pines for issues 2–6,[38] and continued by Hallden/Fawcett for issues 6–75.[39] The Giant series was later renamed the Dennis the Menace Bonus Magazine Series, which started with issue No. 76 in 1970.[40] CBS and Hallden later retitled the series as The Dennis the Menace Big Bonus Series, which ran through issue #194 in October 1979.
