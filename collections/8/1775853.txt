IP editor 71.142.250.117 has tagged the article as POV, with the comment that "way to much hinged on the opinion of Franklin Steiner"... I think there is a valid point here. While we do need to discuss the viewpoint that many of the early Presidents might have been Deists (or at least had deistic leanings), we should not rely solely on Steiner in presenting that viewpoint. Does anyone know of other sources that could be used for this section? Blueboar (talk) 16:10, 13 February 2009 (UTC)
