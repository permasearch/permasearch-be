Satyendranath Tagore, (1842â€“1923), was the first Indian to join the Indian Civil Service.in 1864. Earlier, he and his brother Ganendranath were among the first students to pass the Entrance Examination of Calcutta University in 1857. Even while serving in an adminsistrative job, he was a prolific writer, poet and song composer. Many of his nationalist songs are still sung. He was editor of "Tattwabodhini Patrika" and took an active interest in the Hindu Mela. He encouraged his wife, Jnanadanandini Devi, to adopt western ideas and for that purpose took her to a governor's party and also to England, something unthinkable in those days.[30]
