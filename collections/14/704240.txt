In October 2013, Townshend announced the Who would stage their final tour in 2015, performing in locations they have never played before.[287][288] Daltrey clarified that the tour is unrelated to the band's 50th anniversary—which occurred in 2013—and indicated that he and Townshend were considering recording new material but would be emphasising their hits in their final stadium tour.[289] Daltrey stated, "We can't go on touring forever ... it could be open-ended, but it will have a finality to it."[290]
