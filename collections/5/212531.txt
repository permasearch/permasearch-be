In 1969, Argentina began qualifying for the 1970 World Cup under Pedernera. The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1–0), the 2–2 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at La Bombonera) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.[19][20] To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team. This poor performance that caused the absence of a national representative in the 1970 World Cup is still regarded as one of Argentina's biggest frustrations in its history.[21]
