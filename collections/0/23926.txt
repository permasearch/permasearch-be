Taped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973,[50] the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television, which has now been replaced by Sony Pictures Television.[4][51] The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating "a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre."[3][4] Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns.[3] The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions.[51][52] The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors' faces.[3][51][52][53] Conboy said he used lighting to create "artistic effects".[52] Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody.[3][52] The Young and the Restless' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas.[3] When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.[53]
