Royal Mail is required by law to maintain the universal service, whereby items of a specific size[83] can be sent to any location within the United Kingdom for a fixed price, not affected by distance. The Postal Services Act 2011 guaranteed that Royal Mail would continue to provide the universal service until at least 2021.[84]
