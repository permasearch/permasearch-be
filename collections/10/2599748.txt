A variety of hypochlorites can be formed by a disproportionation reaction between chlorine and metal hydroxides. The reaction is performed at close to room temperature, as further oxidation will occur at higher temperatures leading to the formation of chlorates. This process is widely used for the industrial production of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)2).
