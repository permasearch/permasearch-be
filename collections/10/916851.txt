A fourth small prize was then revealed. If the contestant priced it correctly, he/she won it and earned a "Super Ball." Rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring awarded all three large prizes, while rolling it into either cash ring awarded triple the marked value. If the contestant had already won all three large prizes, he/she could earn a $3,000 bonus by rolling the Super Ball into the WIN ring.
