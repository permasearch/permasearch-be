Other infectious agents include cytomegalovirus, the herpes simplex virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses.[47] Microcephaly is a disorder in which the fetus has an atypically small head,[48] cerebral calcifications means certain areas of the brain have atypical calcium deposits,[49] and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems.[50] It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness.[51] Petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in red/purple spots on the skin.[52] However, cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo.
