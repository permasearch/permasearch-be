More precisely, fix a point      z  ∈  S  2   ( 1 )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} \in S^{2}(1)}   that we place at the zenith. Associated to that zenith is a geodesic polar coordinate system     ( ϕ , θ )   {\displaystyle (\phi ,\theta )}  ,     0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π   {\displaystyle 0\leq \phi \leq \pi }  ,     0 ≤ θ < 2 π   {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta <2\pi }  , where z is the point     ϕ = 0   {\displaystyle \phi =0}  . In these coordinates, the geodesic distance from z to any other point      x  ∈  S  2   ( 1 )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \in S^{2}(1)}   having coordinates     ( ϕ , θ )   {\displaystyle (\phi ,\theta )}   is the value of     ϕ   {\displaystyle \phi }   at x. A spherical circle is the set of points a geodesic distance R from the zenith point z. Equivalently, with a fixed embedding into       R   3     {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}  , the spherical circle of radius     R ≤ π   {\displaystyle R\leq \pi }   centered at z is the set of x in      S  2   ( 1 )   {\displaystyle S^{2}(1)}   such that      x  ⋅  z  = cos ⁡ R   {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {z} =\cos R}  .
