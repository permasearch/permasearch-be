Aside from Viking raids in the Islamic Mediterranean, there were also sustained diplomatic relations between the Vikings (referred to as "Madjus" in Arabic sources[59]) and the Islamic world.[67] The Arab diplomat Al-Ghazal ("the gazelle") was dispatched to the court of the Danish King Harek at Hleiðra in 844 (as recounted in Ibn-Dihya[68]) to make peace with the Danes following their defeat at Sevilla.[68] He was reported back in Córdoba twenty months later.[69] Additionally, a century later the Arab merchant Abraham ben Jacob (also known as Al-Tartushi ) was reported to have travelled to the Viking trading town of Hedeby in Schleswig.[70]
