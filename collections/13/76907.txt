Michael Thornton, writing in the British newspaper The Sunday Express had this to say as part of his review. "I must confess I was yawning up to the moment Bing Crosby made his quiet and studious entrance as the unworldly secretary of a childrenâ€™s orphanage. The years have not dealt lightly with Mr. Crosby. The tips of the famous toupee have receded still further back upon that time-honoured face. But after some moments of horrifying suspicion that he had been introduced as a mute stooge for the Sinatra Clan, the Old Master opened his mouth to sing again and to prove that his sweetness of tone remains unimpaired and undiminished for all his years of seniority."[7]
