The 2008–09 season began well for Howard. Ten games into the season, the center was leading the league in blocks per game (4.2) and even recorded his first triple-double: 30 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks.[27] In December, he injured his left knee and missed the first game of his career after playing in 351 consecutive games.[28] At the halfway point of the season, Howard was leading the league in rebounds and blocks, and was among the league leaders in field goal percentage. He garnered a record 3.1 million votes to earn the starting berth on the Eastern Conference team for the 2009 NBA All-Star game.[29] On March 25, 2009, Howard led Orlando to its second straight Southeast Division title with 11 games of the regular season left to play,[30] and eventually the third seed for the 2009 NBA Playoffs with a 59–23 record.[31] On April 21, 2009, he became the youngest player ever to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, achieving a goal he had set for himself before the start of the season.[7] The Magic went into the playoffs without its injured starting point guard Jameer Nelson, and in the first round against the 76ers, Howard recorded 24 points and 24 rebounds in Game 5 to give Orlando a 3–2 lead, before the Magic closed out the series in six games. On May 6, 2009, the center was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team,[32] and a week later, to the All-NBA First Team.[33]
