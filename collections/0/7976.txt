The Boston Tea Party was a political protest and mercantile protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773.[1] In defiance of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, which allowed the British East India company to sell tea from China in American colonies without paying any taxes, thus undercutting local tea merchants, the demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company.[2]
