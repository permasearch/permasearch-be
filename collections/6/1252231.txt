With the Vikings playing the first ever regular season game at U.S. Bank Stadium in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football, Peterson rushed for 19 yards until leaving the game with an apparent right knee injury.[130] The next day, it was revealed that the right knee had a torn meniscus.[131][132] On September 22, Peterson underwent successful surgery to repair the meniscus. It was also revealed that the knee had a mild LCL sprain, but it did not need surgery.[133] He was placed on injured reserve on September 23, 2016.[134] On December 17, the Vikings activated Peterson to the active roster. He returned to action against the Indianapolis Colts. He had six carries for 22 yards against the Colts.[135][136] Despite only playing three games and rushing for only 72 yards in 2016,[137] Peterson was still ranked 98th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[138]
