Sam Cullen (season 1) is a Deputy Director of the FBI. Little is known about him, other than he has a wife and a daughter diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The episode "The Graft in the Girl" revealed she contracted the disease from an illegally sourced bone graft; Brennan and Booth discovered and arrested the criminal responsible. He does his best to keep Agent Booth on track and frequently disapproves of Dr. Brennan's involvement in FBI field investigations. He has not been seen since the first season.
