Today, in the UK, the detection of GBS colonization using the enrichment broth technique is not offered from most laboratories serving the NHS.

At present, culture for GBS (using enriched culture medium) at 35â€“37 weeks to define an at-risk group of women appears to be the most cost-effective strategy.[52][53]
