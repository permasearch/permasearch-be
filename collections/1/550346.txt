At this time, the hukou system was implemented, which divided the population into urban and rural residents. This was done to make the distribution of state services through danweis and communes easier and to better organize the population in preparation for a possible invasion from the Soviet Union. The hukou system made it illegal to migrate from the countryside to the city.[citation needed]
