High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF.[4][5] Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease.[4] In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever.[11] Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea.[2] Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis.[2][11] However, half of cases are not associated with one of these risks.[2] A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG).[6] A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate.[6]
