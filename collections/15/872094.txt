"I Threw It All Away" was one of the first songs written for Nashville Skyline and one of only two new songs that were definitely written prior to the recording sessions ("Lay Lady Lay" being the other).[2]  Dylan played the song for George Harrison and his wife Patty in November 1968, and Harrison was apparently impressed enough with the song to learn it himself.[2][3]  It was the second song recorded for Nashville Skyline, after "To Be Alone with You", on February 13, 1969.[2][3]
