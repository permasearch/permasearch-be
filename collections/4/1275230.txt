John Wayne had made Rio Bravo with singer Ricky Nelson in a support role to attract teen audiences. It had worked, so he hired Frankie Avalon to perform a similar function. According to Avalon, "Wayne had seen some of the rushes from 'Timberland' and thought I would be right."[11] After making the film Wayne told the press "We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time."[12] "Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes," said Avalon.[13]
