The dissenting opinion, pointed out that Judge Holland and O'Connell "took deliberate measures" to hide their affair." It was not until June 3, 2008, when Hood received the affidavit of Matthew Goeller, a former assistant district attorney, admitting knowledge of the affair, that there was any evidence of the romantic involvement of Holland and O'Connell. "Rumors and gossip, no matter how widespread, how detailed, or how extravagant, are not facts." It was not until Hood's attorneys obtained a court order requiring Judge Holland and Mr. O'Connell to give depositions that they were able to establish the facts about the affair. Under those circumstances, the dissent felt that Hood should not be penalized for his attorneys inability to prove the affairs existence earlier and should have been granted a new trial.[57]
