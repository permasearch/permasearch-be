A process of osmosis through semipermeable membranes was first observed in 1748 by Jean-Antoine Nollet. For the following 200 years, osmosis was only a phenomenon observed in the laboratory. In 1950, the University of California at Los Angeles  first investigated desalination of seawater using semipermeable membranes. Researchers from both University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Florida successfully produced fresh water from seawater in the mid-1950s, but the flux was too low to be commercially viable[3] until the discovery at University of California at Los Angeles by Sidney Loeb[4] and Srinivasa Sourirajan at the National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa,  of techniques for making asymmetric membranes characterized by an effectively thin "skin" layer supported atop a highly porous and much thicker substrate region of the membrane. John Cadotte, of FilmTec Corporation, discovered that membranes with particularly high flux and low salt passage could be made by interfacial polymerization of m-phenylene diamine and trimesoyl chloride.  Cadotte's patent on this process[5] was the subject of litigation and has since expired.  Almost all commercial reverse osmosis membrane is now made by this method.  By the end of 2001, about 15,200 desalination plants were in operation or in the planning stages, worldwide.[2]
