In return, the forces sacked the town and burned the Parliament Buildings. After the US forces departed, a new and much stronger fort was constructed several hundred yards to the west of the original position. Another American attack in 1814 was defeated, the landing force never being able to approach the shoreline. Due to land reclamation, this fort now lies hundreds of metres inland.
