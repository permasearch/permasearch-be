The MTV Video Music Awards were established in the end of the summer of 1984 by MTV[34] to celebrate the top music videos of the year. Originally beginning as an alternative to the Grammy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards is now a respected pop culture awards show in its own right. Normally known as the Best Female Video category, in 2007 the title was briefly changed to Female Artist of the Year. Winehouse received three nominations.
