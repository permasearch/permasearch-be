While picking up the Marquis' pastry order, his driver, Dominique, eyes Geneviève, mistaking her for the baker's daughter, just as the Marquis himself did earlier. Geneviève corrects the handsome chauffeur, but he cockily insists on addressing her as Mademoiselle. Geneviève insists, "Madame!", but he continues flirting with her, flustering her. Aimable returns after trying to find Pompom and reports that the cat has run off.
