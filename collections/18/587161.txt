Reviewers lauded the game's sense of detail and immersion while criticizing it for its frame rate dips and low resolution of 900p.[126][127] Kotaku recommended playing the game without its on-screen minimap and indicators, in praise of the indirect cues that contextually indicate the same information, such as Link shivering when it's cold or waypoints visually appearing in the distance when using the scope.[126] Journalists commented on unexpected permutations of interactions between Link, villagers, pets, and enemies,[127][128][129] as well as a tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who died during the game's development.[127][130] These serendipitous moments proved popular on social media, according to Chris Plante of The Verge. He predicted that more open world games would abandon linear tasks in favor of Breath of the Wild's format, as game publishers would appreciate the free marketing.[131] Gaming journalist Jim Sterling was more critical of the game than most, giving it a 7/10 score. He criticized the difficulty, weapon durability, and general level design, but praised the game's variety of content and open-world mechanics.[132] Post-release updates later addressed some criticism regarding the game's technical performance and unstable frames per second (FPS) experienced at launch.[133][134][135]
