Another important adaptation of endoparasites is the gut, which digests host macromolecules into soluble utilisable products.[2] This feature is particularly important for endoparasites that are not in the alimentary canal, because nutrients are not pre-digested by the host. The gut lining typically has a layer of endodermal cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes to aid digestion. Some endoparasites have both a gut and anus, some lack an anus and some have neitherâ€”i.e., those that live in the alimentary canal, which instead diffuse pre-digested host nutrients across their body surface.[2] The relative importance of the tegument, gut and other adaptations involved in nutrient acquisition varies between different endoparasitic species.
