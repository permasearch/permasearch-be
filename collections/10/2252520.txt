The Stone Mountain area's government of police and services is separated into two distinct municipalities. One area is the Downtown or Historic Section. The other area is the greater Stone Mountain area which resides in both DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. The Downtown or Historic section is governed by a local police department, city hall, and mayor. Residents within the city limits of Stone Mountain receive services from the City of Stone Mountain Police Department while the greater Stone Mountain areas receive services from the larger DeKalb County Police department and Gwinnett County Police department; respectively. "There are often misconceptions about crime in the incorporated City and unincorporated areas that are adjacent to the city limits." [6]
