River otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and muskrats are extremely rare.[56] Beavers cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation.[56] Other rodents, such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice, are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types.[56] Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands, but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries.[56] In addition to bats, coyotes, ringtails, and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles.[56]
