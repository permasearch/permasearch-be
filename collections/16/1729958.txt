At New Release Tuesday, Sarah Fine wrote that this was the band "at the top of their game".[8] CM Addict's Julia Kitzing wrote that the band "never looked back and their albums just keep getting better."[17] At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre found this to be "such a powerful and compelling album".[10] Dave Wood at Louder Than the Music wrote that he "really did grow to love it."[11] At Christian Music Zine, Emily Kjonaas rated the album a 3.25-out-of-five, and felt that because "Restart comes at a time where computerized, auto-tuned music seems to be popular among the mainstream industry" the release may become "popular amongst that crowd."[12] However, she noted that "Newsboys fans may not find this record enjoyable, but Tait-led fans will enjoy Restart."[12] On the other hand, Daniel Edgeman at Christian Music Review called this a "stand out album."[13] At CCM Magazine, Matt Conner wrote that "Electronic dance music is here to stay and clearly so are the Newsboys."[16] DeWayne Hamby, reviewing the album for Charisma, called it "a new collection of pop-flavored tracks".[20]
