In the first stage of prophase I, lepotene (from the Greek for “delicate”), chromosomes begin to condense. Each chromosome is in a haploid state and consists of two sister chromatids; however, the chromatin of the sister chromatids is not yet condensed enough to be resolvable in microscopy.[3] Homologous regions within homologous chromosome pairs begin to associate with each other.[2]
