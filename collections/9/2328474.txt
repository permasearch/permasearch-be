Overlapping definitions of physical abuse and physical punishment of children highlight a subtle or non-existent distinction between abuse and punishment.[21] Joan Durrant and Ron Ensom write that most physical abuse is physical punishment "in intent, form, and effect".[22] Incidents of confirmed physical abuse often result from the use of corporal punishment for purposes of discipline, for instance from parents' inability to control their anger or judge their own strength, or from not understanding childrenâ€™s physical vulnerabilities.[6]
