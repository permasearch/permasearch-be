Upon oral exposure, copper sulfate is moderately toxic.[39] According to studies, the lowest dose of copper sulfate that had a toxic effect on humans is 11 mg/kg.[42] Because of its irritating effect on the gastrointestinal tract, vomiting is automatically initiated in case of the ingestion of copper sulfate. However, if copper sulfate is retained in the stomach, the symptoms can be severe. After 1–12 grams of copper sulfate are swallowed, such poisoning signs may occur as a metallic taste in the mouth, burning pain in the chest, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, discontinued urination, which leads to yellowing of the skin. In cases of copper sulfate poisoning, injury to the brain, stomach, liver, or kidneys may also occur.[41]
