Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is informed consent, the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.[212] Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.[212]
