The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800Â meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter.[24] With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk) hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.[1] Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world[23] and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.[25] He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but didn't win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century.[citation needed]
