With seconds left, the Pats were able to advance the ball down to midfield. With under 10 seconds remaining, Brady tried for the Hail Mary pass that would send the game into OT with a touchdown and 2-point conversion tacked on. However, Gronkowski would be blanketed in the end zone by Eagles defenders causing the pass to fall incomplete and sealing the game and title for the Eagles.
