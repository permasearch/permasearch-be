Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a novella about the life of a schoolteacher, Mr. Chipping, written by the English writer James Hilton and first published by Hodder & Stoughton in October 1934. It has been adapted into two cinema films and two television presentations. The novella has remained an essential part of the English subject syllabus taught at Pakistan's higher secondary school level for the past 30 years, although its choice has received some criticism in the recent past due to perceived lack of relevance to the local society and education system.[1][2]
