It is later revealed that Charming is in fact the son of the Fairy Godmother and that she wants him to marry Fiona so that he can become king (similar to Lord Farquaad's intentions in the first film). Thus, in contrast to his fairytale namesake, this Prince Charming plays a more villainous role, just like his mother. He is characterized as an arrogant, vain and spoiled mama's boy, and she as his doting parent, as well as shallow about his appearance. He later deceives Fiona into believing that he is Shrek, having been turned human by a "Happily Ever After" potion. Nevertheless, his heartless attitude shows through the disguise and Fiona realizes the truth, knocking him unconscious with a headbutt before the end of the film. At the end, he is forcefully kissed by the ugly stepsister, Doris.
