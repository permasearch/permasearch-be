Devil was intended to be the first of The Night Chronicles trilogy,[10] which involved the supernatural within modern urban society. In June 2010, Shyamalan announced the second film titled 12 Strangers, later changed to Reincarnate. The film was about a jury discussing a case dealing with the supernatural. Chris Sparling was set to write the script and Daniel Stamm would direct.[11] Shyamalan also confirmed that the story for the currently untitled third installment was going to be taken from the abandoned sequel to Unbreakable.[12] As of 2017, neither film has been produced, but his unused Unbreakable sequel idea later became the basis for Split.
