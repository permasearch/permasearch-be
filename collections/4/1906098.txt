Gustav made landfall in Haiti at approximately 1 pm EDT on August 26, about 10 miles (16 km) west of the city of Jacmel.[100] While inland, Gustav's rains triggered a landslide in the community of Benet which killed one person.[101] Two more were killed in southwestern Haiti when their house collapsed. Another two deaths were caused by an explosion inside a house, thought to be possibly related to Hurricane Gustav.[102] The southern town of Jacmel, where the hurricane made landfall, was bisected by floodwaters.[51]
