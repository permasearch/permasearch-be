In the early 20th century, federal prosecutors such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt bondage. But such efforts received little support nationally and none in the South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system.

National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.[11]
