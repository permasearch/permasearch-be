As far as can be assumed, however, it seems that they were arranged thusly—from east to west along the north shore of the James River, just inland of the Powhatan, would have been the Eno, Shakori & Saponi. Around the source of the river (& probably holding some of the river's islands a ways back east) should have been the Occaneechi, or Akenatsi. They were believed to have been the "grandfather" tribe of the region, a term among native peoples for any tribe highly respected & venerated for being the first or oldest people of their kind. West of the Occaneechi & primarily located in what is now West Virginia were, at least, two more tribes believed to have been related—the Moneton of the Kanawha River & the Tutelo of the Bluestone River, which separates West Virginia from Kentucky. About midway along the southern shores of the James River should have been the Sissipahaw. They were probably the only Eastern Siouan tribe in the state who would have spoken a form of Catawba language, rather than Saponi/ Tutelo. North of them were the Manahoac, or Mahock. The Keyauwee are also of note. It is difficult to say whether they were a subtribe of others mentioned, a newly formed tribe, or from somewhere else.
