Barton Hollow received significant critical acclaim. The BBC wrote "A timeless, anachronistic record, Barton Hollow could be from 30 years ago, or it could be from 30 years hence. Whatâ€™s certain, though, is that you truly feel it in the here and now," while the New York Daily News wrote "With care and delicacy, they curate their notes, stitching together a sound that's sharp, arch and almost achingly fine."[18][19] The album appeared on the "Best of 2011" lists for NPR Music,[20] Rolling Stone,[21] and Entertainment Weekly,[22] among others, and it was listed at #9 in the "Top 10 of Everything in 2011" in Time.[23]
