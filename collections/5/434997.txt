Despite its length, the song is Dylan's most commercially successful release,[16][34] remaining in the US charts for 12 weeks, where it reached number 2 behind The Beatles' "Help!".[35][36] The promotional copies released to disc jockeys on July 15 had the first two verses and two refrains on one side of the disk, and the remainder of the song on the other. DJs wishing to play the entire song would simply flip the vinyl over.[37][38] While many radio stations were reluctant to play "Like a Rolling Stone" in its entirety, public demand eventually forced them to air it in full.[33][39] This helped the single reach its number 2 peak, several weeks after its release.[39] It was a Top 10 hit in other countries, including Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.[40][41][42][43]
