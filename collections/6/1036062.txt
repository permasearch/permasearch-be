Secondary causes of tics (not related to inherited Tourette syndrome) are commonly referred to as tourettism.[38] Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome.[13] Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders,[56] and stereotypic movement disorder;[57][58] Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning.[13][38] The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome.[28] Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.[26]
