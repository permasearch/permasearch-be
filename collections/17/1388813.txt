A large group of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area was like a courtyard, surrounded on three sides by high-rise flats. The soldiers opened fire, killing one civilian and wounding six others.[43] This fatality, Jackie Duddy, was running alongside a priest, Father Edward Daly, when he was shot in the back.[44]
