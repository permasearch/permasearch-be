We consider what happens when this product is expanded. Because the product skips     m = j   {\displaystyle m=j}  , if     i = j   {\displaystyle i=j}   then all terms are         x  j   −  x  m      x  j   −  x  m      = 1   {\displaystyle {\frac {x_{j}-x_{m}}{x_{j}-x_{m}}}=1}   (except where      x  j   =  x  m     {\displaystyle x_{j}=x_{m}}  , but that case is impossible, as pointed out in the definition section—in that term,     m = j   {\displaystyle m=j}  , and since     m ≠ j   {\displaystyle m\neq j}  ,     i ≠ j   {\displaystyle i\neq j}  , contrary to     i = j   {\displaystyle i=j}  ). Also if     i ≠ j   {\displaystyle i\neq j}   then since     m ≠ j   {\displaystyle m\neq j}   does not preclude it, one term in the product will be for     m = i   {\displaystyle m=i}  , i.e.         x  i   −  x  i      x  j   −  x  i      = 0   {\displaystyle {\frac {x_{i}-x_{i}}{x_{j}-x_{i}}}=0}  , zeroing the entire product.
