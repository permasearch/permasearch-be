In the season finale "A," Hershel appears several times throughout the episode in flashbacks. Hershel convinces Rick into pulling himself from the violence, and to gather animals to domesticate and grow crops in the plots of land. Rick later convinces his son Carl to do the same. His role in the episode is to show Rick's contrasting lifestyles of being a brutalized and uncompromising survivor and later returning to his previously relinquished leadership role between seasons three and four, much to the influence of Hershel. Hershel explains to Rick as they farm and laugh with Beth, as he jokingly refers to her as the new sheriff in the town that "it can be like this all the time". He is also shown hugging his daughter, Maggie and greeting Glenn after they return from a supply run.
