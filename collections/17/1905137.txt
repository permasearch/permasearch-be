The first doctor thought to have been on scene was an off-duty Consultant Anesthetist, Dr Michael Daley.[38] In recognition of his bravery for the role he played in the immediate medical response to the incident, Daley's name was entered into the British Medical Association Book of Valour in June 2017.[39]
