The original Playboy Mansion was a 70-room classical French brick and limestone residence in Chicago's Gold Coast district at 1340 North State Parkway which had been built in 1899 for Dr. George Swift Isham, a prominent surgeon whose social circle included Theodore Roosevelt and Robert Peary; it was ultimately acquired by Hefner in 1959.[14] The building was designed by architect James Gamble Rogers, best known for his work at Yale University and Columbia University.[15] The mansion's basement, Hefner's original "grotto", had a swimming pool with a glass wall.
