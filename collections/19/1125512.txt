The English word manicure comes from the French word manucure, meaning "care of the hands", which in turn originates from the Latin words manus, for "hand", and cura, for "care".[2] Similarly, the English word pedicure comes from the Latin words pes (Genitive case - pedis), for "foot", and cura, for "care".[3]
