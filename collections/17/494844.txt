A month later, Gemma Chan joined the cast as Minn-Erva.[87] In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series She's Gotta Have It.[88] The following day, Lashana Lynch entered into negotiations to replace Wise.[89] By the end of the month, Lynch was confirmed while Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were set to reprise their roles as Korath, Ronan the Accuser, and Phil Coulson, respectively, from earlier MCU films. Algenis Perez Soto, Rune Temte, and Mckenna Grace were also set to star.[2][20] At the same time, Marvel credited Boden and Fleck and the writing team of Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch with writing the screenplay along with LeFauve, Perlman and Robertson-Dworet.[2] With the inclusion of Korath, Ronan, and Coulson (characters established and killed in earlier films), Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film "provide[d] the MCU with another unique opportunity to strengthen the presence of some characters who may not have lived up to their potential and to give great actors, particularly those who portrayed ill-fated villains, a chance to bring more to their roles than their initial opportunities allowed... Captain Marvel allows these characters to become more prominent, and while their fates are sealed for now, their pasts and the stories that reside there can entirely change our perception of them."[90]
