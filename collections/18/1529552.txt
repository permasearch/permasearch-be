Now Deepa suddenly gets up, gets a big stone and throws the stone at Naveen who is sleeping. Naveen's head is smashed completely and he dies immediately. Then Deepa finds a knife and suddenly slits her own throat and dies. Ramesh comes back shouting something about Sowmya, who presumably went missing. But to his surprise he sees both Naveen and Deepa dead. In the end Ramesh is killed by the supernatural ghost. He is shown headless and being dragged away by the ghost.
