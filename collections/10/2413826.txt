In How to Pay for the War, John Maynard Keynes describes a macroeconomic strategy of how Britain, a nation with a population at the time of 40 million people, could conduct a long war against Germany, a nation of 80 millions. At the time How to Pay for the War was written, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union were at war with either Germany or Japan. As a result, the first step for Britain to effectively conduct a war against Germany was to mobilize all its resources for production. Thus, the first two chapters of How to Pay for the War, are an argument for the need for full employment and chapter 3, Our Output Capacity and The National Income, is a manual to achieve full employment.
