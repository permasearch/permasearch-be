The woolly mammoth has remained culturally significant long after its extinction. Indigenous peoples of Siberia had long found what are now known to be woolly mammoth remains, collecting their tusks for the ivory trade. Native Siberians believed woolly mammoth remains to be those of giant mole-like animals that lived underground and died when burrowing to the surface.[156][157] Woolly mammoth tusks had been articles of trade in Asia long before Europeans became acquainted with them. G端y端k, the 13th-century Khan of the Mongols, is reputed to have sat on a throne made from mammoth ivory.[117] Inspired by the Siberian natives' concept of the mammoth as an underground creature, it became recorded in the Chinese pharmaceutical encyclopedia, Ben Cao Gangmu, as yin shu, "the hidden rodent".[158]
