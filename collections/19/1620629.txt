Shareholder voting in the British Virgin Islands is still predicated by the normal basis of majority-control.  However, where the majority exercises their power in a way which is unfairly prejudicial to the minority shareholders, the court may give relief to the minority shareholders.[27]  However, the minority shareholders will need to satisfy the court that the conduct of the majority was unfair - simply exercising their votes to overrule the minority is not unfair in and of itself.  The court also has power to order that a minority shareholder may bring proceedings on behalf of the company against a party whom the company has claims against where the wrongdoers are effectively in control of the company and refuse to take action.[28]
