In Japan, the hymn's title was originally translated as "Itsukushimi Fukaki" (いつくしみ深き, lit. "Merciful"),[8] which is what it is best known by. In 1910, Daisui Sugitani re-wrote the lyrics in Japanese and changed the title to "Hoshi no Yo" (星の界, lit. "World of Stars"). Another version was written by Ryūkō Kawaji with the title "Hoshi no Sekai" (星の世界, lit. "World of Stars"). It is also known by the title "Tsumitoga o Ninou" (つみとがをにのう, lit. "To Bear Sin"). The hymn is popular at wedding ceremonies in Japan.[9]
