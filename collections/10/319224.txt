After the Page Avenue tour ended in late 2004, Story of the Year returned to the studio with producer Steve Evetts in 2005, to record their second studio album. In the Wake of Determination, released on October 11, 2005, is much heavier sounding than the previous album. As of March 2006, that album had only sold 150,698 units[5] and has failed to achieve the gold certification that the band's two previous releases had, per the RIAA website.[4] Although not as successful as its predecessor, the album debuted at No.Â 19 on the Billboard 200.
