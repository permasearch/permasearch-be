Tom Wilson was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach of the Aggies following Bellard's resignation.[51] The Aggies enjoyed moderate success under Wilson's tutelage, compiling a record of 21-19 and an Independence Bowl victory in 1981.[52] However, the mediocrity did not sit well with the administration, and Wilson was fired after the 1981 season.[53]
