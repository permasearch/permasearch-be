After the release of the novel Jurassic Park in 1990, Michael Crichton was pressured by fans for a sequel novel. Having never written a sequel, he initially refused.[13] While filming the novel's film adaptation, Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg believed that if a sequel film were made, it would involve the retrieval of a canister that contained dinosaur DNA and that was lost during the events of the first film.[14] Discussions about a sequel film began after the 1993 release of Jurassic Park, which became a financial success.[13] Spielberg held discussions with David Koepp and Crichton – who both wrote the previous film – to discuss possible ideas for a sequel film.[15] The production schedule for a second Jurassic Park film was dependent on whether Crichton would write a sequel to the first novel.[15]
