The theme first appears pianissimo in the dominant key of B♭ (mm. 7, 21), then piano in the secondary dominant key of F (m. 41), then a pianissimo restart in B♭ (m. 73), and finally a full fortissimo statement in the tonic key of E♭ (m. 93). Later, a downward arpeggio motif with sforzandos on the second beat is played twice in unison, first by the strings (mm. 115–119) and then by the full orchestra (mm. 123–127).  This is followed by a syncopated motif characterized by descending fourths (m. 143), leading to the repeat.
