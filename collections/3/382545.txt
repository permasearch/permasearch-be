In 1985, Kevin Moran of Manchester United became the first player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, he had fouled Peter Reid with a sliding tackle which missed the ball.[31] United went on to win the match 1–0, after extra time. Since then, only four other players have been sent off in the FA Cup Final: José Antonio Reyes for Arsenal in 2005, Pablo Zabaleta for Manchester City in 2013, Chris Smalling of Manchester United in 2016, and Victor Moses of Chelsea in 2017. Of these, only Zabaleta and Moses ended up on the losing side.[32]
