Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode A–, saying "While the overarching turkey mystery is funny and creative, the best parts of “Turkey In A Can” are within the smaller stories, the throwaway conversations, and bits of character growth."[2] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10, saying "This episode is as close to a perfect as this show has come up this season. The family gets plenty of time to play off of one another, the jokes are quick and sharp, and it all wraps up not with some boring lesson being imparted by one character to another, but in some simple human truth about parents and their young kids. As well, it is evidence that strengthens the case that Bob’s Burgers is the best sitcom on TV right now."[3]
