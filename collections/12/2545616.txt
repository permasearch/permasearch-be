Within Western culture, the term "magic" has been linked to the idea of the Other,[6] and with the idea of "foreignness".[17] In Styers' words, it has become "a powerful marker of cultural difference".[18] It has also been repeatedly presented as the archetypally non-modern phenomenon.[19] Among Western intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, magic was seen as a defining feature of "primitive" mentalities and was commonly attributed to marginal groups, locations, and periods.[18]
