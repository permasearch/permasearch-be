The first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in Eâ™­ (1807) by the Swedish composer Joachim Nicolas Eggert.[6] The composer typically credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra, however, was Ludwig van Beethoven, who used it in the last movement of his Symphony No. 5 in C minor (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his Symphony No. 6 in F major ("Pastoral") and Symphony No. 9 ("Choral").
