With Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on The Rock, who stole Austin's title belt on the November 17 episode of Raw Is War after Austin suffered a beating by his Nation of Domination stablemates.[46] In the weeks to come, The Rock began declaring himself to be "the best damn Intercontinental Champion ever".[46] The Rock kept possession of the title belt until D-Generation X: In Your House, when Austin defeated him to retain the title and get his title belt back. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid in his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the title against The Rock the next night on Raw Is War.[46] In an act of defiance after forfeiting the title to The Rock, Austin tossed the title belt into a New Hampshire river.[2]
