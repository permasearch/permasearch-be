The LaRue Restaurant was established in December 1950 by Billy Wilkerson.[2] The following year, oil tycoon Jake Freedman of Houston, Texas bought LaRue for $15,000.[3][4] Freedman's idea was to build the best hotel and casino in Las Vegas to specifically cater to the glamorous Hollywood film stars and executives in a $600,000 project.[4]  Numerous sources state that organized crime figures Meyer Lansky,[5] Frank Costello and Joseph "Doc" Stracher[6] and illegal bookmakers like Mike Shapiro,[7][a] Ed Levinson,[11] and Sid Wyman were involved in the financing of Sands and had shares in it. Lansky and his mob assumed ownership of the Flamingo Hotel after the murder of Bugsy Siegel in 1947, and Lansky and Costello also had business interests in the Thunderbird Hotel and El Cortez Club in Downtown Las Vegas.[5]
