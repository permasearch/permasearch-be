The phrase "China Dream" (中国梦), and the associated idea of a collective hope for restoring China's lost national greatness, have ancient origins in Chinese literary and intellectual history.[6] In the Classic of Poetry (Shi Jing), the poem "Flowing Spring" (下泉) describes a poet waking up in despair after dreaming of the former Western Zhou dynasty. During the troubled Southern Song dynasty, the poet Zheng Sixiao wrote a poem in which he coined the phrase "Heart full of [the] China Dream (中国梦), the ancient poem 'Flowing Spring.'"[7] Moreover, popular patriotic literary and theatrical works in early 20th century China also made reference to a "China Dream," before the concept of the "American Dream" was invented in 1931.[6]
