Johnny Depp was another unknown when he was cast; he initially went to accompany a friend (Jackie Earle Haley, who went on to play Freddy in the 2010 remake) so he could audition, yet eventually got the part of Glen.[14] Glen Lantz's epic death in this movie is paid homage to by a flashback in Freddy vs. Jason and Depp gets his own nod in a cameo role in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as a guy on TV.[26] Craven's daughters picked Depp's headshot from the set he showed them.[21] Other actors such as Charlie Sheen (who wanted too much money[21]), John Cusack, Kiefer Sutherland, Nicolas Cage, and C. Thomas Howell were considered.[citation needed]
