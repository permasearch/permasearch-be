The Fiesta has been Britain's most popular new car in 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997, 1998, and each year from 2009 through 2014.[109] By the time of the MK2 Fiesta's demise in early 1989, just under 1,300,000 had been sold in Britain since its launch 12 years earlier. By July 2014, the Fiesta became the UK's best selling car of all time, with 4,115,000 sold.[113]
