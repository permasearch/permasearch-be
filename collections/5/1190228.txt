The first recording of "Nutbush City Limits" was produced by Ike Turner at his Inglewood, California facility, Bolic Sound Studio, in May 1973 and released as a single the following month by the couple under their professional name, Ike & Tina Turner. Though Ike composed the music, he did not list his name in the credits alongside Tina, who wrote the lyrics.[citation needed] This version is characterized by inventive guitar sounds, a clavinet, a substantial synthesizer solo, and a funky brass section.
