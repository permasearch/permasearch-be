The running gag of Kenny's deaths in earlier seasons was incorporated into the season 9 (2005) episode "Best Friends Forever" when Kenny, in a vegetative state, is kept alive by a feeding tube while a media circus erupted over whether the tube should be removed and allow Kenny to die. The episode received much attention as it served to provide commentary on the Terri Schiavo case,[29][30] originally airing just one day before Schiavo died.[31] The episode earned South Park its first Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.[32]
