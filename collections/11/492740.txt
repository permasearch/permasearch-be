Anne intends to reward Whitlock's loyalty to her by making him the sole beneficiary of her $1,000,000 life insurance policy. Whitlock suggests that she should travel to Switzerland to undergo a newly-developed, groundbreaking treatment. The problem is that Anne does not have any money. Desperate to help her, Matt takes $450,000 out of evidence and gives it to her so she can make the trip. When the $450,000 goes up in flames in a suspicious house fire that kills Anne and Chris, Whitlock is horrified to find their charred remains.
