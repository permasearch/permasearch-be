In the season eight premiere, it is revealed that the Veritas device does not allow others to control Clark, but rather strips him of his powers. Wandering the globe with Russian gangsters, Clark is eventually found and rescued by Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) and John Jones, with the latter restoring Clarks powers.[22] During season eight, Clark uses his new job at the Daily Planet to access advance information, which he uses to stop crime around the city.[23] In subsequent episodes, Clark adopts the name "Red-Blue Blur" as his superhero moniker.[24] Toward the end of the season, Clark wrestles with the idea of having to kill Davis Bloome (Sam Witwer), a new friend, after discovering that Davis is actually Doomsday, a genetically engineered creature created by General Zod to kill Clark and destroy Earth.[25] In the season eight finale, Clark finds a way to separate Davis' personality from that of Doomsday, and buries Doomsday a mile underground. When Davis subsequently kills Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), Clark decides that his human-learned emotions have caused him the most trouble, as it was his compassion for Davis that led to Jimmy's death. He vows that "Clark Kent is dead".[26]
