His 2006 annual salary was about US$100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies.[103] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[104] He continued to live in the same house in the central Dundee neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500, a fraction of today's value. He also owns a $4 million house in Laguna Beach, California.[105] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it "The Indefensible". This act was a break from his past condemnation of extravagant purchases by other CEOs and his history of using more public transportation.[106]
