An example of a true IVT is the Hydristor because the front unit connected to the engine can displace from zero to 27 cubic inches (440 cm3) per revolution forward and zero to −10 cubic inches (−160 cm3) per revolution reverse. The rear unit is capable of zero to 75 cubic inches (1,230 cm3) per revolution. However, whether this design enters production remains to be seen. Another example of a true IVT that has been put into recent production[11] and which continues under commercial development[12] is that of Torotrak.
