The word "hallelujah" is sung as part of the Hallel Psalms (interspersed between Psalms 113â€“150).[20] In Tractate Shabbat of the Talmud, Rabbi Yose is quoted as saying that the Pesukei dezimra Psalms should be recited daily.[21] Psalms 145-150, also known as the Hallel of pesukei dezimra, are included to fulfill this requirement in the liturgy for the traditional Jewish Shacharit (morning) service.[22] In addition, on the three Pilgrimage Festivals, the new moon and Hanukkah, Psalms 113-118 are recited.[23] The latter psalms are known simply as Hallel with no additional qualification.
