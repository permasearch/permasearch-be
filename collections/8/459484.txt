CREs are found in the vicinity of the genes that they regulate. CREs typically regulate gene transcription by functioning as binding sites for transcription factors. A single transcription factor may bind to many CREs, and hence control the expression of many genes. The Latin prefix cis means "on this side", i.e. on the same molecule of DNA as the gene(s) to be transcribed. CREs are often but not always upstream of the transcription site.
