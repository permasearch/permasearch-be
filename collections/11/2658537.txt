Rubinstein's first step was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its objectives were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives.[50][51] The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers.[52] In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton.[53] A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone.[54] Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.[51]
