On October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts and largely derived its funding from the Morrill Act.  Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area.  Only nine students worked the 20-acre (81,000Â m2) college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop.  Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements.
