Intensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.[116] Oklahoma, while successfully raised, was never repaired, and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage, though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels. Today, the two hulks remain where they were sunk,[117] with Arizona becoming a war memorial.
