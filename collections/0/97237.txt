Fold mountains form when two tectonic plates move towards each other at a convergent plate boundary. Fold mountains form from sedimentary rocks that accumulate along the margins of continents. When plates and the continents riding on them collide, the accumulated layers of rock may crumple and fold like a tablecloth that is pushed across a table, particularly if there is a mechanically weak layer such as salt.[1]
