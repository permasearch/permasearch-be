In 1980 Stanley L. Weinberg, a veteran high-school teacher in Iowa, began to organize statewide Committees of Correspondence "committed to the defense of education in evolutionary theory," modelled upon the committees of correspondence in pre-Revolutionary America. Their purpose was to keep interested parties informed about creationist endeavours and to share ideas for responses, allowing a political response at a local level. This grew into volunteer networks in most states, with the Creation/Evolution Newsletter interconnecting them,[5] which was incorporated as the NCSE in 1983.[6] In 1987, author and lecturer Eugenie Scott, who holds a PhD in Physical Anthropology, became its executive director.[7] The Board of Directors and official supporters, as explained by NCSE, "reflects our scientific roots."[this quote needs a citation]
