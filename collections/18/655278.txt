Most of the Lightning's early stars were gone by 1998 due to free agency and a series of ill advised trades. Crisp was fired 11 games into the 1997â€“98 season and replaced by Jacques Demers. Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993, he was unable to change the team's fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games.
