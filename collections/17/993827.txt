The ACO rules for closed-top prototypes allowed cars to run with larger air restrictors, resulting in more power (about 600Â hp), which resulted in a higher top speed in combination with the lower drag. To compensate this advantage over the duration of a race, the LMGTPs were limited to smaller tyres and smaller fuel tanks.
