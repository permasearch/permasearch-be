In the Middle Ages, it was believed that the sound of a bell could disperse thunder.[3] A large number of bell-ringers were electrocuted as a result. In France between the years 1753 and 1786, 103 bell-ringers were killed during thunderstorms as a result of holding on to wet bell ropes. The Parlement of Paris enforced an edict in 1786 to prohibit the practice.[4] Deaths likely continued until the 19th century, when the lightning rod came into general use.
