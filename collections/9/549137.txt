Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. After several tries, Bing Bong realizes their combined weight is too much and jumps out to allow Joy to escape; having sacrificed himself, Bing Bong fades away completely. In the meantime, Riley bought a one-way bus ticket to Minnesota while her parents grew increasingly worried over her disappearance. Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and manages to get them to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to successfully extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to alight from the bus and to return home.
