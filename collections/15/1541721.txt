The first Eastern States Exposition occurred in 1916. It was originally conceived by Joshua L. Brooks as a way to help promote agriculture and educate young people with the skills and knowledge needed in agricultural vocations. The Exposition featured displays of innovations in the industry, and held contests designed to encourage farmers to better themselves through competition. Since the first Exposition, only World War I and World War II, during which the military requisitioned the grounds as storage depots, have interrupted the annual tradition.[3]
