John Portman was the principal architect for the original design. The first phase consisted of a five tower rosette rising from a common base. Four 39-story office towers surround the 73-story hotel rising from a square-shaped podium which includes a shopping center, restaurants, brokerage firms, and banks.[10][11] The first phase officially opened in March 1977. Portman's design brought renewed attention to city architecture,[11] since it resulted in construction of the world's tallest hotel at the time.[9] Two additional 21-story office towers (known as Tower 500 and Tower 600) opened in 1981. This type of complex has been termed a city within a city.
