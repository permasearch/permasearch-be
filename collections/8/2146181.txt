Here y is an unknown function (scalar or vector) of time t, which we would like to approximate; we are told that        y Ë™      {\displaystyle {\dot {y}}}  , the rate at which y changes, is a function of t and of y itself. At the initial time      t  0     {\displaystyle t_{0}}   the corresponding y value is      y  0     {\displaystyle y_{0}}  . The function f and the data      t  0     {\displaystyle t_{0}}  ,      y  0     {\displaystyle y_{0}}   are given.
