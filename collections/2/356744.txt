Reward/punishment: 2013 Miss California Mabelynn Capeluj hosted the men's reward where they got to go go-kart racing. The women were assigned to pick up all the pieces from the broken plates and clean both kitchens for tonight's service. Sarah spent most of the punishment wandering around trying to find a place to plug in a vacuum cleaner, much to the annoyance of her teammates. Before service, Chef Ramsay pulled Milly, who was having a crisis of confidence about his level of experience, into the pantry for a pep-talk.
