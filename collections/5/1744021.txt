Land clearing began on December 1, 2000, and construction on the footers began February 9, 2001. X-Flight was originally supposed to open in early May 2001,[6] but due to technical difficulties, its opening was delayed.[1] During testing, problems were discovered with several devices including the reclining mechanism on the trains and their restraints.[1] X-Flight's media day was eventually held on May 24, 2001, and the ride officially opened two days later on May 26.[7][8]
