The journal Pediatrics has published a study in which lice can be killed by suffocating them using a non-toxic face cleanser to effectively "shrink wrap" them over an extended period of time achieving a success rate of roughly 95%. The procedure in the study used application of the product Nuvo lotion (Cetaphil), thoroughly combed in with a regular comb and blow dried, and then hair was shampooed after 8 hours. This was repeated once per week for 3 weeks using two study groups: one that followed up by removing nits and the other that did not. There was no appreciable difference in success rates in the groups. In its conclusion, the Journal stated, "Dry-on, suffocation-based, pediculicide lotion effectively treats head lice without neurotoxins, nit removal, or extensive house cleaning. These results are comparable or superior to the results previously reported for treatments with permethrin, pyrethrin, and malathion."[23]
