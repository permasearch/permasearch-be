The 2008 Indiana team was hampered by a number of injuries.[56] Against Wisconsin, the Hoosiers were forced to play three quarterbacks and four centers.[56] 13 starters in total were injured during the year. Still, Lynch was able to pull in the one of the strongest recruiting classes in recent history. 2009 showed marked improvement on the field, although the record ledger failed to show it as the team took 4th quarter leads into three Big Ten road games before falling short.[56] During Lynch's tenure, the players established a Player's Leadership Council, which elect weekly game captains and select the community service organizations the team volunteers with.[56] The Boys and Girls Club of Bloomington and Riley Children's Hospital of Indianapolis are two favorite causes of the team. Lynch's tenure has been noted for his strong recruiting and identifying and developing high character young men who want to be part of a family atmosphere.[56] However, after four seasons, Lynch compiled just a 19â€“30 overall record[55] and was fired by athletic director Fred Glass.[56]
