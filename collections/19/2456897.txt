On July 24, 2015, Linick and McCullough said they had discovered classified information on Clinton's email account,[101] but did not say whether Clinton sent or received the emails.[101] Investigators from their office, searching a randomly chosen sample of 40 emails, found four that contained classified information that originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA).[101] Their statement said that the information they found was classified when sent, remained so as of their inspection, and "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system".[101]
