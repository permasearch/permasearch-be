Clay bricks expand as they absorb heat and moisture. This places compression stress on the bricks and mortar, encouraging bulging or flaking. A joint replacing mortar with eslastomeric sealant will absorb the compressive forces without damage.[6] Concrete decking (most typically in sidewalks) can suffer similar horizontal issues, which is usually relieved by adding a wooden spacer between the slabs. The wooden expansion joint compresses as the concrete expands. Dry, rot-resistant ceder is typically used, with a row of nails sticking out that will embed into the concrete and hold the spacer in place.[7]
