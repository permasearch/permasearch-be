JosÃ©phine had lovers, such as Lieutenant Hippolyte Charles, during Napoleon's Italian campaign.[302] Napoleon learnt of that affair and a letter he wrote about it was intercepted by the British and published widely, to embarrass Napoleon. Napoleon had his own affairs too: during the Egyptian campaign he took Pauline Bellisle Foures, the wife of a junior officer, as his mistress. She became known as "Cleopatra".[303][note 9]
