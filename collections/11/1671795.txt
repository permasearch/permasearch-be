By the early 1960s, instrumental rock and roll had been pioneered successfully by performers such as Link Wray, The Ventures and Duane Eddy.[20] This trend was developed by Dick Dale, who added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, the distinctive reverb[16] (giving the guitar a "wet" sound),[21] and the rapid alternate picking characteristic of the genre[16] (influenced by Arabic music, which Dale learnt from his Lebanese uncle).[22] His performances at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa, California during the summer of 1961,[23] and his regional hit "Let's Go Trippin'" later that year, launched the surf music craze, which he followed up with hits like "Misirlou" (1962).[16]
