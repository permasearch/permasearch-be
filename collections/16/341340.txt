Diana then turns into a demonic, malevolent creature that can act only in the darkness. The creature latches onto Sophie, and kills anyone to tries to help or be with her. She interferes with Sophie's intentions of trying to get better, and frightens Sophie's daughter Rebecca by taking her drawing of her family and inserting herself into it as a stick figure while rubbing out her father, that Rebecca moves out of the house. Some years later, she appears at Sophie's second husband's work place and kills him. She haunts Sophie's second child, Martin, that he is unable to get sleep anymore. When Martin is at Rebecca's place, she goes there and haunts them, scratching onto the floor her name and a stick figure resembling Rebecca's old drawing.
