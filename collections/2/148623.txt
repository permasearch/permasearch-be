An increment of a stochastic process is the difference between two random variables of the same stochastic process. For a stochastic process with an index set that can be interpreted as time, an increment is how much the stochastic process changes over a certain time period. For example, if     { X ( t ) : t ∈ T }   {\displaystyle \{X(t):t\in T\}}   is a stochastic process with state space     S   {\displaystyle S}   and index set     T = [ 0 , ∞ )   {\displaystyle T=[0,\infty )}  , then for any two non-negative numbers      t  1   ∈ [ 0 , ∞ )   {\displaystyle t_{1}\in [0,\infty )}   and      t  2   ∈ [ 0 , ∞ )   {\displaystyle t_{2}\in [0,\infty )}   such that      t  1   ≤  t  2     {\displaystyle t_{1}\leq t_{2}}  , the difference      X   t  2     −  X   t  1       {\displaystyle X_{t_{2}}-X_{t_{1}}}   is a     S   {\displaystyle S}  -valued random variable known as an increment.[48][49] When interested in the increments, often the state space     S   {\displaystyle S}   is the real line or the natural numbers, but it can be     n   {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional Euclidean space or more abstract spaces such as Banach spaces.[49]
