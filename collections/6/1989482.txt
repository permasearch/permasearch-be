In November 1923, Winkler married Charles Mintz and handed over the business to him when she fell pregnant a few months later.[21][22] Mintz was often described as a cold, stern and ruthless chain-smoking tyrant; one employee remembered him as "a grim-faced man, with a pair of cold eyes glittering behind the pince nez" and "never talked to the staff. He looked us over like an admiral surveying a row of stanchions."[23] While Winkler had offered gentle critiques and encouragement, Mintz communicated to Disney in a harsh and cruel tone.[22][24] In 1927, Mintz ordered Disney to stop producing Alice Comedies due to the costs of combining live-action and animation.
