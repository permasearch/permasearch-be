Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3Â½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa features expansion slots; conversely, like the Apple II, it is an "open system". The Lisa 2 motherboard has a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets and slots. There are two RAM slots, one CPU slot, and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there are three "Lisa" slots parallel to each other. This flexibility provides the potential for a developer to create a replacement for the CPU "card" to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations from other parts of the system.
