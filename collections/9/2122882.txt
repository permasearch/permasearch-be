To ensure fairness and reliability, there are certain recognised procedures for identity parades.[164] The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures.[165] Nowadays identity parades are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially-fitted identity-parade rooms have one-way glass so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes identity parades are not possible or feasible, in which case photo parades take place. For the suitable conditions for photo parades, see S v Ndika.[166]
