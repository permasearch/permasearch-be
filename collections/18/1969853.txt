Between Yuma and Gila Bend, I-8 runs alongside the routes of both the Gila Trail and the Butterfield Overland Mail Company line. The latter was a stagecoach line that went between Tipton, Missouri, and San Francisco, with several stations in between, and was used to transport passengers across the country at five miles per hour (8.0Â km/h) between 1858 and 1861.[152] In later years, the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed, paralleling the Gila River east of Fortuna;[153] by 1877, the tracks were complete to Yuma. Work continued the next year, and by 1880 the tracks were extended to Tucson from Yuma.[154]
