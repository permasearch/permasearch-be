A pure protein added externally can be used as a normalization control if it is spiked into each of the samples at a known concentration. A known quantity of protein is added which can be controlled ensuring that the detection is within the linear range of the antibody. An advantage to this method is that there are more proteins to choose from as controls, than HKP.[15] However, expression of the protein of interest is only compared to one other protein. Spike-in proteins can control only for certain steps in the western blotting process, depending upon when they are introduced. When introduced after sample extractions from cells or tissues, the spike protein only controls for differences in sample loading and transfer but not any experimental error in sample preparation methods.
