The manga begins in 2001, when the Diamond Is Unbreakable character Koichi Hirose goes to Naples at the request of Jotaro Kujo to find someone known as Haruno Shiobana and get a skin sample of theirs. Shiobana turns out to be a middle school student named Giorno Giovanna—which sounds similar to "Haruno Shiobana"—who is the son of Dio Brando. Giorno attempts to steal Koichi's luggage, but is stopped by Koichi's Stand, Echoes Act Three. Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience, a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects. The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people, specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned. After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka, he attempts to join Passione, an organized crime group that employs many Stand users (essentially, his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood's band, in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader). He is approached by a member of Passione, Bruno Bucciarati, who suspects him of killing Luka. During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati's Stand, Sticky Fingers, that can place and open a zipper on any surface. Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione, and therefore visit the Capo, Polpo, in prison.
