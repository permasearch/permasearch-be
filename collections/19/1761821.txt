Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. He has also licensed his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[164] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[165] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least 59 million dollars in revenue for his companies.[166]
