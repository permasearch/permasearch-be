In design of experiments, single-subject design or single-case research design is a research design most often used in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior in which the subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group. Researchers use single-subject design because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using single-subject design, howeverâ€”because the subject serves as their own control, this is still a single-subject design.[1] These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research.[2]
