In 1979 Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee briefly used a ComBat aluminium metal bat. After some discussion with the umpires, and after complaints by the English team that it was damaging the ball, which was later proved untrue, he was urged by the Australian captain Greg Chappell to revert to a wooden bat.[6] The rules of cricket were shortly thereafter amended, stating that the blade of a bat must be made entirely of wood.[4]
