However, beginning in 1957, films recorded in stereo (except for those shown in Cinerama or Todd-AO) carried an alternate mono track for theatres not ready or willing to re-equip for stereo.[19] From then until about 1975, when Dolby Stereo was used for the first time in films, most motion pictures—even some from which stereophonic soundtrack albums were made, such as Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet—were still released in monaural sound,[20] stereo being reserved almost exclusively for expensive musicals such as West Side Story,[21] My Fair Lady,[22] or Camelot;[23] epics such as Ben-Hur[24] or Cleopatra.[25] Stereo was also reserved for dramas with a strong reliance on sound effects or music, such as The Graduate,[26] with its Simon and Garfunkel score.
