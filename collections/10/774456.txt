School districts formed, and by 1838 the first direct tax was levied allowing access to the school for all.[90] The first appropriation for the common schools came in 1838, a sum of $200,000. The average salary for male teachers in some districts during this early period was $25/month and $12.50/month for females.[91] By 1915, the appropriations for the common schools totaled over $28 million.[90] The first middle school in the nation, Indianola Junior High School (now the Graham Expeditionary Middle School), opened in Columbus in 1909.
