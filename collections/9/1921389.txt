Raj's younger sister Priya, a lawyer by profession, visits Pasadena en route to Toronto. Though unknown to the others including Raj, Priya had been involved in a sexual encounter with Leonard five years earlier, despite Leonard's assurance to Howard that he would never hit on Priya in deference to Raj. That night, Priya sneaks into Leonard and Sheldon's apartment unknown to Sheldon and has sex with Leonard. Sheldon finds out the following morning that Leonard and Priya had "coitus" and frames an elaborate, flawless lie to cover it up, which involves Leonard having had sex with an imaginary Irish bartender named Maggie McGeary. But Leonard decides not to hide the truth and confesses to Raj that he slept with Priya. Raj is initially upset, but reconciles with Leonard after he says that Priya broke his heart. The guys then unleash confessions of all of the deceptions they have perpetrated on each other, including Howard dropping Raj's iPhone into a urinal, Sheldon's experiment feeding moth parts to Leonard mixed in his food and Raj using Sheldon's toothbrush. Sheldon becomes upset at Raj for using his toothbrush and terminates his friendship with him, but immediately forgives him after Raj reveals that he gave him a talking Thomas the Tank Engine with real puffing smoke for Thanksgiving.
