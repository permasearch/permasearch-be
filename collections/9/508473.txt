As of 2016[update] student nurses in England and Wales can apply a bursary from the government to support them during their nurse training, and may also be eligible for a student loan, although there has been speculation that this will not be available in the future.[71] Student nurses in Scotland still receive a standard bursary which is not means tested, and their tuition fees continue to be paid - however, they are not eligible for student loans.
