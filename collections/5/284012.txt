In the 2017 live-action remake, the Wardrobe is portrayed by Audra McDonald and is known as Madame de Garderobe, wife of court composer, Maestro Cadenza, and also a well-respected opera singer. The Enchantress' curse separated her from her husband, and as the rose withered, she was prone to dozing off more often as she became more inanimate. After the Enchantress lifts the curse and restores everyone to human form, Garderobe is reunited with her husband and sings at the celebratory ball at the end of the film.
