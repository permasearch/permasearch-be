After McGreevy pushed for the series to be filmed in the Pittsburgh area, production was expected to start in early June 2012 and last until November.[19][20] In mid May, Gaumont International Television pulled out of Pennsylvania in favor of production at the Cinespace Film Studios in Toronto.[21] The move came about after Gaumont management had a misunderstanding on how the Pennsylvania Film Tax Credit program works.[22] Filming began on July 13, 2012 in Port Perry, Ontario; a small town about 40 miles (63Â km) northeast of Toronto that has been transformed to look like Hemlock Grove, the fictional Western Pennsylvania town the series is set in.[23]
