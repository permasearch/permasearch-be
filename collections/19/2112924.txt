Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes.[9] Prenatal care may include taking extra folic acid, avoiding drugs and alcohol, regular exercise, blood tests, and regular physical examinations.[9] Complications of pregnancy may include disorders of high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, iron-deficiency anemia, and severe nausea and vomiting among others.[3] In the ideal childbirth labor begins on its own when a woman is "at term".[13] Pregnancy is considered at full term when gestation has lasted 39 to 41 weeks.[4] After 41 weeks, it is known as late term and after 42 weeks post term.[4] Babies born before 39 weeks are considered early term while those before 37 weeks are preterm.[4] Preterm babies are at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy.[4] Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons.[14]
