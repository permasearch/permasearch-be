Strong World received largely positive reviews from critics, praising the film's story and character designs, as well as Oda's involvement in the film. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom post described the film as "a very streamlined Oda story that would have gone on for twenty or thirty episodes if it was done as a regular arc with the TV series", adding that the storyline was "predictable" but also "well polished". Beveridge also praised the film for having a stronger connection to the One Piece TV series than the franchises previous films.[30] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network awarded the film a 'B' rating, praising the storyline and character design. Silverman commented that "no one can come up with weird laughs or monsters quite like Oda", although unfavorably comparing some of the animation to "stop-motion animation". Silverman also commented on the English dubbing of the film, saying that Ian Sinclair's debut as Brook "does a very good job with the loopy skeleton", although she found Scott McNeil's "pseudo-Caribbean" accent as Shiki "a little off-putting".[31] Despite being largely unfamiliar with the franchise, Kyle Mills of DVD Talk called FUNimations release "Highly Recommended", praising the "terrific cast of characters" and "giant kick ass final fight".[32] Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com also recommended Strong World, describing it as "loud, frenetic and frequently nonsensical," but also "kind of crazily entertaining at the same time" Kauffman also added that "while Strong World won't necessarily be incomprehensible to newcomers", "those with a solid grounding in the background of the story and its many characters will reap the most rewards from this particular outing".[33] Strong World also currently has a rating of 7.1 out of 10 collated from both film critics and users on IMDb.[34]
