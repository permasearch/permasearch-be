Also in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing began to affect the market for launch of US military payloads. For nearly a decade the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) had faced no competition for military launches.[194] Without this competition, launch costs by the U.S. provider rose to over $400 million.[195] The ULA monopoly ended when SpaceX began to compete for national security launches. At a side-by-side comparison, SpaceX’s launch costs for commercial missions are considerably lower at $62 million.[196]
