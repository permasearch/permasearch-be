In 1801 The Acts of Union came into force and responsibility for fortifications in Ireland passed from the Irish Board of Ordnance, which was abolished, to the Board of Ordnance in London. It was the job of the Board to implement the decision to erect the fortress and it fell to Charles Holloway Commanding Engineer Cork District to begin the works.[15] In 1804 The Hampshire Chronicle reported that the overall height of Spike island had been reduced by 25 feet and the spoil used as infill to create a level foundation.[21] The same paper reported that on 6 June 1804 General Sir Eyre Coote had laid the foundation stone of the new fortress.[22]
