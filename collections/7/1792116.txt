The guideline of silent prayer comes from Hannah's behavior during prayer, when she prayed in the Temple to bear a child.[18] She prayed "speaking upon her heart," so that no one else could hear, yet her lips were moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not loud enough for others to hear.
