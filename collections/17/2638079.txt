From 2003 until June 2007 the role of Secretary of State for Transport was combined with the role of Secretary of State for Scotland.  This arrangement changed on 28 June 2007, when in the appointment of his first Cabinet, Prime Minister Gordon Brown assigned the responsibilities of Secretary of State for Scotland to Des Browne, his Secretary of State for Defence.
