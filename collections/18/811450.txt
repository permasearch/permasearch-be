This is a Running Man project where the members are competing against the production staff, where the former is requesting for the program to visit vacation venues for delight missions while the latter want to send them to visit distinctive venues for dangerous missions. Each episode will have both sides compete where the winner is allowed to put their recommendation into a spinning wheel with a member's name attached to complete the mission. The final decision will be conducted after 4 venues have been decided.
