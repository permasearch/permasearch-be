The Staten Island approach to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was the first part of the new project to be completed, and it opened in January 1964.[112] The upper deck was opened on November 21, 1964, at a cost of $320 million in 1964 dollars, equivalent to $2,525 million in present dollars.[113] Politicians at all levels of the government, from Brooklyn Borough President Abe Stark to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, wrote speeches paying tribute to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.[114] The opening ceremony was attended by over 5,000 people, including 1,500 official guests. Several dignitaries, involving the mayor, the governor, and the borough presidents of Brooklyn and Staten Island, cut the gold ribbon. They then joined a motorcade to mark the official opening of the bridge. A 35-cent toll was charged to all motorists crossing the bridge.[115][113] The Verrazano Bridge's opening was celebrated across Staten Island.[116] Moses did not invite any of the 12,000 workers to the opening,[110] so they boycotted the event and instead attended a mass in memory of the three workers who died during construction.[113]
