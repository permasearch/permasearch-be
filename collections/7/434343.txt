The Plague of Justinian caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 541 and the 8th century.[37] Steady growth resumed in 800 CE.[38] However, growth was again disrupted by frequent plagues; most notably, the Black Death during the 14th century. The effects of the Black Death are thought to have reduced the world's population, then at an estimated 450 million, to between 350 and 375 million by 1400.[39] The population of Europe stood at over 70 million in 1340;[40] these levels did not return until 200 years later.[41] England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500.[42] New crops from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth.[43]
