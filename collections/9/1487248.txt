Ceceo is a phenomenon found in a few dialects of southern Spain in which /s/ and /θ/ are not distinguished and there is only one coronal fricative phoneme realized as [s̟], a sibilant sounding somewhat like [θ], but not identical.[2] Ceceo is found primarily in some varieties of Andalusian Spanish, although Hualde reports that there is some evidence of it in parts of Central America. A publication of the University of Oviedo also notes that the ceceo can be found in Argentina and Chile.[3] Other linguists have noticed the use of ceceo in parts of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Venezuela.[4][5] It is a largely rural pronunciation and is often stigmatized.[6]
