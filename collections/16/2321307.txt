The Moche may have also held and tortured the victims for several weeks before sacrificing them, with the intent of deliberately drawing blood. Verano believes that some parts of the victim may have been eaten as well in ritual cannibalism.[12] The sacrifices may have been associated with rites of ancestral renewal and agricultural fertility.  Moche iconography features a figure which  scholars have nicknamed the "Decapitator"; it is frequently depicted as a spider, but sometimes as a winged creature or a sea monster: together all three features symbolize land, water and air. When the body is included, the figure is usually shown with one arm holding a knife and another holding a severed head by the hair; it has also been depicted as "a human figure with a tiger's mouth and snarling fangs".[13]  The "Decapitator" is thought to have figured prominently in the beliefs surrounding the practice of sacrifice.
