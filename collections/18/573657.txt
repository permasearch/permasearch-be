On January 8, Iglesias and the Tigers agreed to terms on a one-year contract worth $1.65 million.  Although Iglesias is under team control through 2018, his 2014 salary had yet to be determined after the contract he signed with the Red Sox as an amateur free agent expired.[15] Iglesias missed the entire 2014 season due to stress fractures in both of his shins.[16]
