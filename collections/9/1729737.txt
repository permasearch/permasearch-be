Ziva is an Israeli Jew, and was always seen wearing a Star of David pendant[56] until her capture in Somalia, where her captor ripped it off her neck. Shortly before her captivity, she said that she "would sooner die than take this necklace off".[57] In early seasons, her Judaism is only alluded to,[20] leading some commentators to identify her as a secular Israeli.[56] She does not appear to follow Orthodox Jewish strictures, dating men who are not Jewish, though she celebrates Jewish holidays, observes Shabbat, and has been seen praying in Hebrew on several occasions. In the aftermath of her father's death in Season 10, she is shown praying in a synagogue, visiting the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and planting an olive tree.[58] Ziva has made references to keeping kosher;[30] however, in her second episode on the show, she is seen eating a slice of pepperoni pizza, which goes against kosher dietary laws.[27] After being forced to fatally shoot her half-brother, Ari, to keep him from killing Gibbs, she quietly sings "El male rachamim" ("God, full of mercy"), an Ashkenazi Jewish mourning song, over Ari's body.[27]
