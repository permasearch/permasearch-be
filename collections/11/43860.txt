The Chicago Tribune reported that in 2015, nearly 1,000 civilians in the United States were shot and killed by police officersâ€” whether the officers behind the trigger are heroes or villains is now often publicly called into question in the age of viral videos.[55] As more people are uploading videos of their encounters with police, more departments are encouraging their officers to wear body cameras.[56] The procedure for releasing such video is currently evolving and could potentially incriminate more suspects than officers, although current waiting times of several months to release such videos appear to be attempted cover-ups of police mistakes.[57] In October 2015, then-FBI Director James Comey remarked in a speech at the University of Chicago Law School that the increased attention on police in light of recent viral videos showing police involved in fatal shootings has made officers less aggressive and emboldened criminals. Comey has acknowledged that there is no data to back up his assertion; according to him, viral videos are one of many possible factors such as cheaper drugs and more criminals being released from prison. Other top officials at the Justice Department have stated that they do not believe increased scrutiny of officers has increased crime.[58]
