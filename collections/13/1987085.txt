The bowler at the point must have part of their front foot behind the popping crease and be within the return crease. The rules do not prohibit the bowling of the ball from behind the popping crease, and may be well behind it. The ball cannot be thrown or, since 2000, delivered with an underarm action.[6] The batsmen "take guard" or "block" on the popping crease in front of the wicket, although the may choose to do so before or after the crease. That nets to a typical distance of about 58 feet (17.7Â m) between the delivery point and batsman.
