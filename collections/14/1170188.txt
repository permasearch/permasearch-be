Schools have been the center of controversy over both the anthem and the national flag.[35] The Tokyo Board of Education requires the use of both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs.[106] Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens.[13] As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag.[35] Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintar≈ç Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo.[107] After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.[108]
