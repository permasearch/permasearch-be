In 1961 Rudolph married William Ward, a North Carolina College at Durham track team member;[28] they divorced in 1963.[29] In the interim, Rudolph retired from track competition at the age of twenty-two, following victories in the 100-meter and 4 x 100-meter-relay races at a U.S.â€“Soviet meet at Stanford University in 1962.[30] At the time of her retirement, Rudolph was still the world record-holder in the 100-meter (11.2 seconds set on July 19, 1961), 200-meter (22.9 seconds set on July 9, 1960), and 4 x 100-meter-relay events. She has also won seven national AAU sprint titles and set the women's indoor track record of 6.9 seconds in the 60-yard dash. As Rudolph explained it, she retired at the peak of her athletic career because she wanted to leave the sport while still at her best and did not compete at the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.[15][30] Rudolph said, "If I won two gold medals, there would be something lacking. I'll stick with the glory I've already won like Jesse Owens did in 1936."[15]
