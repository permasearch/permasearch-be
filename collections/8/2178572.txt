On March 18, 2018, the publication of both books was used as a comedy piece on Last Week Tonight to raise awareness of Mike Pence's stated anti-LGBT attitudes. John Oliver stated that Pence's pet rabbit was the one thing he liked about Pence, and that because of this, he had taken issue with the real-life Marlon Bundo having to make a stop at the anti-LGBT organization Focus on the Family during an upcoming promotional book tour with the Pences.[2][3] With the Pences' book scheduled to appear on March 19, John Oliver announced the publication of a "better Bundo book" at that very moment (so preceding the Pences' book).[4][5]
