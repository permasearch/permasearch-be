Alfred is also remembered as a literate king. He or his court commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was written in Old English (rather than in Latin, which was the language of the European annals).[98] Alfred's own literary output was mainly of translations, though he wrote introductions and amended manuscripts as well.[98][99]
