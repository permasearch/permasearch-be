So far only three impact events have been successfully predicted in advance. Currently prediction is mainly based on cataloging asteroids years before they are due to impact. This works well for larger asteroids (> 1 km across) as they are easily seen from a long distance. Over 95% of them are already known, so their orbits can be measured and any future impacts predicted long before they are on their final approach to Earth. Smaller objects are usually too faint to observe very far in advance and so most can only be observed on final approach. Current mechanisms for detecting asteroids on final approach rely on wide-field ground based telescopes, such as the ATLAS system. However current telescopes are not powerful enough to detect the smaller asteroids that commonly impact Earth unless conditions are just right, which is why so few are detected.[82]
