The HDMI founders began development on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, with the goal of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI.[12][13] At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs.[13][14][15] HDMI 1.0 was designed to improve on DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced YCbCr capability and consumer electronics control functions.[13][14]
