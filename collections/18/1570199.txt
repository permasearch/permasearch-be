The video was taken at around Angel underground station in Islington, London, and was uploaded to YouTube on 22 April 2010.[20] It narrates the story of a girl addicted to drugs, living on the streets of London, played by Selina MacDonald. She tried to sell The Big Issue magazines for money, but only managed to sell one to Sheeran. The girl struggled so much that she resorted to selling her body to earn money. She may not have loved it, but it provided her with a general income. Later on, the pain became too much for her to bear and she just wanted to end it all. She traded in her "dirty" money for drugs, referencing the lyric "...and in a pipe she flies to the motherland." In the end, the girl succumbs to her drug abuse and dies. Some relative, or perhaps friend finds her dead, hence at the beginning of the video where she is found and someone is looming over her seeming to be mourning her death. An acoustic, unplugged version of the song was also uploaded onto the official Ed Sheeran YouTube page on 10 May 2011.
