In January 2017, Minnesota United FC, a Major League Soccer expansion team debuting for the 2017 Season, announced that Target would be the team's front-of-jersey match kit sponsor, as well as sponsoring MLS overall. This brings one of the largest sponsors in the league, especially for an expansion team making its debut appearance. The team also has an advantage of having a large, well-known hometown brand versus an entity outside the region, in addition to the financial benefits of such a large sponsor.
