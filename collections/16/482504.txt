There are two main kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities in the form of liquids, powder or particles are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal.[167] The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them[168] with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals.[169][169] Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation.[170] The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.[171]
