By 450â€“449 BC the revolts in Miletus and Erythrae were quelled and Athens restored its rule over its allies.[61] Around 447 BC Clearchus [62] proposed the Coinage Decree, which imposed Athenian silver coinage, weights and measures on all of the allies.[49] According to one of the decree's most stringent provisions, surplus from a minting operation was to go into a special fund, and anyone proposing to use it otherwise was subject to the death penalty.[63]
