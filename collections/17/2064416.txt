The C4 metabolic pathway is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants, involving a complex set of adaptive changes to physiology and gene expression patterns.[21] About 7600 species of plants use C4 carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants.  All these 7600 species are angiosperms.
