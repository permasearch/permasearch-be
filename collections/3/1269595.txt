Carter Kane is one of two main protagonists and narrators; a descendant of Narmer and of Ramses the Great. He is the son of Julius and Ruby Kane. After the death of his mother (when he was eight years old), he spent six years travelling the world with his Egyptologist father. After his father is captured by the god Set during The Red Pyramid, Carter spends most of his time with his sister Sadie and uncle Amos Kane. He becomes the host of Horus in the first novel, and often collaborates with and receives advice from the god. He also develops a romantic relationship with the shabti of magician Zia Rashid, and subsequently spends much of his time trying to find the real Zia and demonstrate his feelings toward her. Like his father, Carter has dark skin and hair, quite different from both his mother and sister. When living with his father, Carter dressed "impeccably" like Julius even when relaxing, but adopts a much more casual style when he goes to live at Brooklyn House. Though he is not one to flout rules, Carter is brave and courageous enough to pursue the way of the gods despite the House of Life's disapproval. His specialty is combat magic; his preferred weapon a khopesh, but loses it in The Throne of Fire.[19] He is often given leadership responsibilities and struggles to accept his role, until he willingly becomes pharaoh of the House of Life during The Serpent's Shadow.
