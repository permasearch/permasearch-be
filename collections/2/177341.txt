Starting with the 1796 election, Congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party's presidential candidates.[3] Before 1820, Democratic-Republican members of Congress would nominate a single candidate from their party. That system collapsed in 1824, and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention.[4]
