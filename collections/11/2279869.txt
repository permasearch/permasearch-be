In 1960, singer and actress Debbie Reynolds recorded a version of "Am I That Easy to Forget" that reached number 25 on the U.S. pop chart. The highest charting version of the song on the U.S. pop chart was recorded by singer Engelbert Humperdinck on August 11, 1967. Released as a single in late 1967[1] from his album The Last Waltz,[2] it reached number 18 on the Hot 100 and number one on the Easy Listening chart in early 1968.[3] Humperdinck's version was also a big hit in England, where it spent two weeks at number three on the UK Singles Chart,[4] as well as in Ireland, where it spent three weeks at number one on the Irish Singles Chart. Humperdinck himself recorded a special version for Italy, in the local language, entitled "Dimenticarti non potrei" ("I couldn't forget you").
