The dispute came to a head at the AFL's convention in Atlantic City in 1935, when William Hutcheson, the President of the United Carpenters, made a slighting comment about a rubber worker who was delivering an organizing report. Lewis responded that Hutcheson's comment was "small potatoes," and Hutcheson replied, "I was raised on small potatoes, that is why I am so small." After some more words, Lewis punched Hutcheson, knocking him to the ground. Lewis then relit his cigar and returned to the rostrum. The incident, which was also "small potatoes" but very memorable, helped cement Lewis's image in the public eye as someone willing to fight for workers' right to organize.
