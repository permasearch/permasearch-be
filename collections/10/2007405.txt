Defense spending, in regards to its relativity to the NPR, began to decrease in 1991, after the Cold War. This trend continued until 2001's terrorist attacks, and the war on terror began. The conclusion can be made that the NPR did not greatly affect defense spending, rather defense spending is greatly dependent on international affairs and conflict. There was very little way for the NPR to adjust governmental spending on defense, as the Defense Department in the United States is a larger, more independent agency of the government. It is important to note that while the defense budget has fluctuated by billions of dollars, the U.S. Defense spending in relativity to percentage of U.S. GDP has only fluctuated within 1%-2%.[18]
