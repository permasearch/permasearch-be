There have been several American-Canadian computer animated and motion capture-based direct-to-video films based on and featuring the doll Barbie. Since her film debut appearance in the 1987 film Barbie and the Rockers: Out of this World, Barbie has been a computer animated virtual actress starring in several feature films and short films (including a 1998 video game, Barbie: Riding Club, that contains a short film). After a fourteen-year absence, Mattel commissioned films to feature Barbie as a heroine in several films to accompany a franchise of related dolls and accessories. Barbie also made appearances in My Scene, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 and the upcoming Toy Story 4.
