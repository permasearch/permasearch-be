The new model is based on Ford's global B platform, sharing its underpinnings with the Fiesta supermini,[33] and embodies Ford's Kinetic 2.0 design theme.[40] The hatchback is a five-door only model and it is now 266 mm (10.5 in) longer than the previous model, with the wheelbase increased by 190 mm (7.5 in).[41] The four-door sedan has the same wheelbase as the hatchback, but two length variants: a longer one in Brazil (dubbed Ka+), measuring 4,254 mm (167.5 in),[42] and a shorter one exclusively in India (dubbed Aspire), measuring 3,995 mm (157.3 in).[43]
