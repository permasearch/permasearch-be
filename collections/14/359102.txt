Syndication is handled by Warner Bros. Television (under Turner Entertainment Co., which in 1986 acquired UA's share of the series as part of the classic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library). It has aired on TBS from 1990 to 2003, where it also aired with colorization on season one for a while. TNT aired it at some point in the 1990s, and also aired the colorized season one. Nick at Nite later aired the series from 2000 to 2001. It then shifted to TV Land, where it aired from 2001 to 2003 (and again from January to June 2014). Then, in 2004, it aired on Hallmark Channel.
