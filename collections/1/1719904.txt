Although Miller later claimed to have written the song in 1946 -- only being able to record it himself in 1949 -- he actually co-wrote it with Robert Yount in 1949.[4] As they were working at that time with Dub Williams, a pseudonym of James Pebworth,[5] they gave him one-third of the song. The song was released with the writing credited to Miller-Williams-Gene, as Yount was using his stage name of Bobby Gene.[4]
