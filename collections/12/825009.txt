In English, the term "Briton" originally denoted the ancient Britons and their descendants, most particularly the Welsh, who were seen as heirs to the ancient British people.[10] After the Acts of Union 1707, the terms British and Briton came to be applied to all inhabitants of the Kingdom of Great Britain and its empire.[11]
