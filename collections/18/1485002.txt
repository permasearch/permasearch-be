Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies.  According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas marked the first time a well-known African-American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life.[131]  Her books "stretch over time and place", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S., and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.[132]  She published her seventh autobiography Mom & Me & Mom in 2013, at the age of 85.[133] Critics have tended to judge Angelou's subsequent autobiographies "in light of the first",[134] with Caged Bird receiving the highest praise.  Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer Hilton Als called her "wisdom books" and "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts".[38]  Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, Robert Loomis, an executive editor at Random House; he retired in 2011[135] and has been called "one of publishing's hall of fame editors."[136]  Angelou said regarding Loomis: "We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers."[137]
