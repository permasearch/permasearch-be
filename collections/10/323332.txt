In Oklahoma, each county decides for itself whether it will permit the sale of alcohol by the glass.[6] Low-point beer may not be sold for consumption on-premises or allowed to be consumed in places licensed to sell alcohol between 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. This crime is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and up to 6 months imprisonment.[9]
