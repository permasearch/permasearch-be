Many MPI functions require that you specify the type of data which is sent between processes. This is because MPI aims to support heterogeneous environments where types might be represented differently on the different nodes[12] (for example they might be running different CPU architectures that have different endianness), in which case MPI implementations can perform data conversion.[12] Since the C language does not allow a type itself to be passed as a parameter, MPI predefines the constants MPI_INT, MPI_CHAR, MPI_DOUBLE to correspond with int, char, double, etc.
