While nightmares (bad dreams that cause feelings of horror or fear) are relatively common during childhood, night terrors occur less frequently.[5] Sleep terror episodes are estimated to occur in 1â€“6% of children, and in less than 1% of adults.[6] Night terrors have been known since ancient times, although it was impossible to differentiate them from nightmares until rapid eye movement was discovered.[3]
