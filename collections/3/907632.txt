Boney M was hugely popular in the Soviet Union in the 1970s, although the song "Rasputin" was banned by the Soviet authorities during the group's concert in Moscow in December 1978.[22] In the Soviet film Repentance (1987), "Sunny" is played at a party of high-ranked communist officials.[23] "Sunny" is played during a few parts of the successful Korean film of the same name Sunny (2011).[24] It is the theme song of the 2011 Taiwanese drama starring Rainie Yang and Wu Chun, Sunshine Angel.
