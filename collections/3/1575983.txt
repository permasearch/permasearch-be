The hijacking on Flight 93 began at 09:28.[40] By this time, Flights 11 and 175 had already crashed into the World Trade Center and Flight 77 was within 9 minutes of striking the Pentagon. The hijackers on those flights had waited no more than 30 minutes to commandeer the aircraft, most likely striking after the seat-belt sign had been turned off and cabin service had begun.[27] It is unknown why the hijackers on Flight 93 waited approximately 46 minutes to begin their assault. At 09:28:17, First Officer LeRoy Homer[41] managed to transmit to the ground, shouting, "Mayday! Mayday! Get out!" over the radio amidst sounds of violence.[42] A Cleveland Air Traffic Controller replied, "Somebody call Cleveland?" but received no reply.[27]
