Compared to starting pitchers, most relievers (with the except of closers with large save totals) receive few awards and honors.[31] Some setup men who have been selected to Major League Baseball All-Star Games include Brendan Donnelly, Hideki Okajima, Carlos MÃ¡rmol, Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Arthur Rhodes, David Robertson, Tyler Clippard, Hong-Chih Kuo, Brett Cecil, and Steve Delabar. A setup man has never won the Cy Young Award or the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award; the highest placements in these respective awards have been achieved by Mariano Rivera who finished third in the voting for the American League (AL) Cy Young Award and twelfth for the AL MVP in 1996, and for the next season he was promoted to closer.[32][32] Setup pitchers typically make less than the MLB average salary.[33][34] Middle reliever Andrew Miller became the first relief pitcher other than a closer to win a League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award when he was voted the 2016 ALCS MVP.
