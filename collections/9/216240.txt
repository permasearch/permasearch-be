The power required is pronounced in the film as one point twenty-one "jigowatts".[2] While the closed-captioning in home video versions spells the word as it appears in the script, jigowatt,[5] the actual spelling matches the standard prefix and the term for power of "one billion watts": gigawatt. Although rarely used, the "j" sound at the beginning of the SI prefix "giga-" is an acceptable pronunciation for "gigawatt."[6][7] In the DVD commentary for Back to the Future, Bob Gale states that he had thought it was pronounced this way because it was how a scientific adviser for the film pronounced it.[8]
