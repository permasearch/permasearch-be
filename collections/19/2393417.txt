The initial march took place on May 25, 2013. The number of protesters who took part is uncertain; figures of "hundreds of thousands" and the organizers' estimate of "two million"[82] were variously cited. Events took place in between 330[81] and 436[82] cities around the world, mostly in the United States.[81][83] Many protests occurred in Southern California, and some participants carried signs expressing support for mandatory labeling of GMOs that read "Label GMOs, It's Our Right to Know", and "Real Food 4 Real People".[83] Canal said that the movement would continue its "anti-GMO cause" beyond the initial event.[82] Further marches occurred in October 2013 and in May 2014 and 2015. The protests were reported by news outlets including ABC News,[84] the Associated Press,[82] The Washington Post,[85] The Los Angeles Times,[83] USA Today,[82] and CNN (in the United States), and Russia Today[86] and The Guardian[80] (outside the United States).
