In the first episode of the third season, Walt finds the teddy bear's missing eye in the pool filter. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it "a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for",[66] and The A.V. Club commented that "the pink teddy bear continues to accuse".[67] Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of Gus Fring's face in the fourth-season finale.[68]
