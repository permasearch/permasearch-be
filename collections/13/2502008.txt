In the DC Rebirth relaunch, when Iris West seemingly kills Eobard in the 25th Century, a cloaked figure sends the Renegades back in time to arrest Iris. The hooded man is then revealed to be Zolomon who proclaims that the only way to make the Flashes better heroes is to pit them in a war where they will experience tragedy.[18] Zolomon muses that he sees Wally as the 'true' Flash, reflecting that Barry's ability to accept that he will die is the crucial difference between Barry and Wally as the Flash (feeling that Wally goes into situations determined to survive) and musing that this difference is how he will provoke his planned war.
