Hannah's blonde wig is the primary difference between her and the brunette Miley, although Hannah also wears more extravagant clothes, make-up, and sometimes large sunglasses. In the Hannah Montana story, the famous blonde wig was picked out for Miley by Roxy.[19] (In real life, the wig was not chosen until the second episode. The original wig seen in the pilot was a slightly different style, though the famous blonde wig was first seen in Hannah's concert footage of "This Is the Life" in the first scene of the pilot). Miley Stewart also mentions that she intentionally patterned Hannah's look after her godmother Aunt Dolly Parton, though it was never officially stated if Parton was the true inspiration behind the character's wardrobe, Hannah's look does draw heavy influence from the real-life Queen of Country as she is the real-life godmother of Cyrus.[20]
