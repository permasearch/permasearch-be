All this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and Chordata.[107] The former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.[108] The latter are dominated by the vertebrates, animals with backbones.[109] These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.[110]
