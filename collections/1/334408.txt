Section 954 of Doddâ€“Frank deals with clawback of compensation policies, which work to ensure that executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting.[234] These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies.[236] These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, in the case of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements.[236] If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement.[237] The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015.[240]
