Upon entering World War I, the United States, led by Woodrow Wilson created and implemented The Committee on Public Information which was made up by the Secretaries of State, the Army, and the Navy.[2] The committee would report directly to President Wilson and was essentially a massive generator of propaganda.[2] The Committee on Public Information was responsible for producing films, commissioning posters, publishing numerous books and pamphlets, purchasing advertisements in major newspapers, and the recruitment of business men, preachers and professors to serve as public speakers in charge of altering public opinion at the communal level.[2] The committee, headed by former investigative journalist George Creel, emphasized the message that America's involvement in the war was entirely necessary in achieving the salvation of Europe from the German and enemy forces.[2] In his book titled "How we Advertised America," Creel states that the committee was called into existence to make World War I a fight that would be a "verdict for mankind."[4] He called the committee a voice that was created to plead the justice of America's cause before the jury of public opinion.[4] Creel also refers to the committee as a "vast enterprise in salesmenship" and "the world's greatest adventure in advertising."[4] The committee's message resonated deep within every American community and also served as an organization responsible for carrying the full message of American ideals to every corner of the civilized globe.[4] Creel and his committee utilized every possible mode to get their message across, including; printed word, spoken word, the motion picture, the telegraph, the poster and the sign board.[4] All forms of communication were put to use in order to justify the causes that compelled America to take arms.
