Exeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.[73] The topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a volcanic plug, on which the Rougemont Castle is situated. The Cathedral is located on the edge of this ridge and is therefore visible for a considerable distance.
