Starbucks launched a new Mobile Order & Pay app in Portland, Oregon on December 2015.[163] This includes a bar code in mobile. This bar code needs to be scanned by a small scanner at the counter. Customers can pay from their smartphone by just waving their phone off the scanner. In one-quarter, 16% of transactions were made through this mobile app.[citation needed]
