On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all former high officials of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard.[113] They were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five.[114] Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day and were not permitted to address each other or their guards.[115] As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months out of four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation.[116]
