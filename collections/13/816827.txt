The island is depicted in a copper shade representative of its name;  the name Cyprus has roots in the Sumerian word for copper (zubar)  from the large deposits of copper found on the island. The crossed green olive branches symbolise the hope for peace between the Turks and the Greeks. It was designed by İsmet Güney, a Turkish Cypriot painter.
