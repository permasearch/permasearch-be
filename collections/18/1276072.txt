There is basic but production quality support in Windows XP for IPv6 and Teredo tunneling through the Advanced Networking Pack later incorporated into Windows XP SP2. IPv6 has to be installed and configured from the command line using the netsh interface ipv6 context as there is no GUI support. After the network interface's link-local address is assigned, stateless autoconfiguration for local and global addresses can be performed by Windows XP. Static IPv6 addresses can be assigned if there is no IPv6 router on the local link. Transition mechanisms such as manually configured tunnels and 6to4 can be set up. Windows Firewall beginning with Windows XP SP2 also supports IPv6 stateful filtering. Applications and tools such as the Telnet client, FTP client, ping, nslookup, tracert, DNS resolver, file and print sharing, Internet Explorer, IIS have been updated to support IPv6. Privacy extensions are enabled and used by default. 6to4 is automatically activated for public IPv4 addresses without a global IPv6 address. Other types of tunnels can be set up include: 6over4, Teredo, ISATAP, PortProxy. Teredo also helps traverse cone and restricted NATs. Teredo host-specific relay is enabled when a global IPv6 address has been assigned, otherwise Teredo client functionality is enabled.
