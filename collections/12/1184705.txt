There are many national languages in India.[13][14] However, there are 22 official languages as mentioned in article 343/1 of the Constitution of India.[15]. States of India were free to adopt one or more local languages for all or any of the official purposes of that state.[15] Today all 22 languages carry equal official status and Government documents can be in any of the 22 recognized official languages. This has been clarified by court rulings as well, as for example in 2010 Gujarat High Court affirmed equal role to all 22 languages.[14][16] India has a common law legal system â€“ therefore, unless overturned by the legislature or a higher court explicitly, the ruling in 2010 takes precedence and all 22 official languages are meant to be taken on equal footing. Currency notes in India typically carry the denomination in all 17 languages.
