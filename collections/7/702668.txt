The second semi-final, played at The County Ground, Derby, was reduced to 42 overs per side due to rain. India posted a score of 281/4, with Harmanpreet Kaur scoring 171 (not out) from 115 balls, including seven sixes. This was the highest individual score in the knockout stages of a World Cup,[10] and was widely heralded as one of the greatest ever World Cup innings.[11][12] In response, Australia was bowled out for 245, leaving India the victors by 36 runs.[13]
