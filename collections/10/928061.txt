Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 8 reviews.[2] James Queally of The Star-Ledger commented about the episode, "For 10 episodes American Horror Story has ranged from ridiculous to ghoulish fun... but "Birth" is all execution, and quite frankly, that might be exactly what this show needs to be."[3] The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff stated, "In general, I thought "Birth" was basically fine, just my kind of genre hokum/guilty pleasure. But at the same time, it was just a touch too sedate."[4]
