Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% of people at some point in their life,[9] or 24 million people worldwide as of 2011.[170] It occurs 1.4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men[14]—the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females.[171] Onset in childhood is much rarer,[172] as is onset in middle or old age.[173]
