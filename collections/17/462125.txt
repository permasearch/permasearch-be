Pullman conceived The Book of Dust before the publication of Lyra's Oxford in 2003.[3][4] On his website in April 2005, he wrote that the book was "under way".[5] In 2007, he described it as "a big, big book".[6] In a 2009 interview with Oxford University newspaper Cherwell, Pullman stated that The Book of Dust was "growing" but that he was "encountering complexities that seem to be making it longer than I thought it would be."[7] In 2011, Pullman said that he was considering writing The Book of Dust in two volumes, one set before His Dark Materials and the other set afterwards.[8] In September 2012, Pullman told the BBC that The Book of Dust was now his focus and that he had written 220 pages.[9] In December, he told Wired that he had cleared 2013 and most of 2014 to write the book.[10] In May 2016, he said he had vowed to not cut his hair until it was complete.[11]
