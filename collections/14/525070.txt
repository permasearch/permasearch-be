Rosie gives a speech at the wedding, telling Alex that she loves him as a friend. Her daughter Katie brings a friend named Toby with her, in a friendship that is reminiscent of Rosie and Alex when they were children. During the dance, Toby suddenly kisses Katie, and Katie pushes him away and runs outside. Rosie and Alex follow her. Alex counsels her and tells her to follow her feelings with Toby otherwise she might regret it, a reference to how he has felt about Rosie. After a moment, Toby finds Katie and apologizes for what he did, telling her just to forget whatever had happened, but Katie interrupts him with a kiss. Alex realizes that Rosie does not remember the kiss which they shared on her 18th birthday and that he misinterpreted her desire to forget that night as her not wanting to be more than friends.
