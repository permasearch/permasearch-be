The Miz debuted as SmackDown's host on June 2,[40] hyping up the crowd at the top of the show. Other duties included backstage interviews and hosting a bikini contest. The hosting duties seemed sporadic at best, with some weeks having little to no involvement of Miz at all. Starting in July, Miz, along with Ashley Massaro, hosted the annual Diva Search competition on both Raw and SmackDown.[41][42][43]
