However, much less progress has been achieved on sanitation: Access increased only from 71% to 79% during the same period.[156] Significant problems remain concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance.

Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities.
