Despite the mortality rate, Washington did curb the spread of smallpox, which had plagued the Continental Army since the American Revolution had begun in 1775. In January 1777, Washington had ordered mass inoculation of his troops, but a year later at Valley Forge, smallpox broke out again. An investigation uncovered that three to four thousand of their troops had not gotten inoculated, despite having long-term enlistments.[36] So, Washington ordered inoculations for any soldiers vulnerable to the disease.
