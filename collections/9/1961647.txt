Christopher McQuarrie, who went uncredited for his work on X-Men, was hired to write the screenplay for the Wolverine sequel in August 2009.[32] According to Shuler-Donner, the sequel would focus on the relationship between Wolverine and Mariko, the daughter of a Japanese crime lord, and what happens to him in Japan. Wolverine would have a different fighting style due to Mariko's father having "this stick-like weapon. There'll be samurai, ninja, katana blades, different forms of martial arts - mano-a-mano, extreme fighting." She continued: "We want to make it authentic so I think it's very likely we'll be shooting in Japan. I think it's likely the characters will speak English rather than Japanese with subtitles."[33] In January 2010, at the People's Choice Awards, Jackman stated that the film would start shooting sometime in 2011,[34] and in March 2010 McQuarrie declared that the screenplay was finished for production to start in January the following year.[35] Sources indicated Darren Aronofsky was in negotiations to direct the film[36] after Bryan Singer turned down the offer.[37]
