At the time of the first 2013–14 Big Ten season matchup of the teams, Sporting News's Bill Bender felt the rivalry was the best in the Big Ten largely due to the teams' excellence in the prior three seasons.[11] With Michigan State riding an 11-game winning streak, including seven in conference, and Michigan riding an eight-game winning streak, including six in conference, the January 25 game marked the first time in Big Ten history that two teams have met when both teams were 6–0 or better in conference play.[12] (#21/#25T)[13] Michigan defeated the (#3/#3)[13] Spartans 80–75.[14] It was the first time Michigan ever defeated three consecutive AP Poll top ten opponents and marked the first time since the 1986–87 Iowa Hawkeyes that any team has won three consecutive games against top 10 opponents.[15] It also gave the team consecutive road wins against top five opponents after a 36-game losing streak against them.[14][15] Michigan's 7–0 Big Ten start was their best since the 1976–77 team won its first eight games.[15]
