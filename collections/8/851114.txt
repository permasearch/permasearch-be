Later during the Mauryan period (321â€“185 BCE), an instrument called adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker directing him to pay the sum on the note to a third person, which corresponds to the definition of a modern bill of exchange. The considerable use of these instruments has been recorded[citation needed]. In large towns, merchants also gave letters of credit to one another.[15]
