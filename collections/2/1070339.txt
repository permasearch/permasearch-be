The album also affirmed Gaye's influence over later R&B styles and artists.[22] Gaye's change of musical style and production soon became contemporary and popular, prior to the disco era of the late 1970s. Several successful Motown artists, including Lionel Richie and Rick James, were influenced by many of the elements of Gaye's recording style for their work in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[9] The slow jam sound and contemporary R&B production in general were greatly influenced by the album's use of vocal multi-tracking and instrumentation. Allmusic calls the album "the blueprint for all of the slow jams to follow decades later â€” much copied, but never imitated."[28] Renown engineer Russell Elevado's work in the neo soul genre, including his production for D'Angelo's Voodoo (2000) and Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000), has been influenced by Gaye's and Townsend's production techniques and sound.[9][39]
