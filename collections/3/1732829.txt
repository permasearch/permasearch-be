The valleys of Etla and Ocotl치n are traversed from north-west to south by the Atoyac River which provides water for a small strip of land bordering the river, when it periodically floods. To provide water for crops elsewhere in the valley away from the river, the Zapotecs used canal irrigation. By using water from small streams, the Zapotecs were able to bring water to Monte Alb치n, situated 400 meters above the valley floor. Archaeologists found remains of a small irrigation system consisting of a dam and a canal on the south-eastern flank of the mountain. As this would not have been enough to support all the population of Monte Alb치n, it is assumed that there were many other irrigation systems.[12] Likewise, crops grown in the valley were not enough to sustain the rapid population growth in the Monte Alb치n I phase. Therefore, crops were grown on the foothills where the soil is a less fertile and artificial irrigation was needed.[12]
