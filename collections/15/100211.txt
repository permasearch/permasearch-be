Quantum Leap follows the narrative of Dr. Sam Beckett (Bakula), a physicist who has become stuck in the past as a result of a time-travel experiment gone wrong, and his attempts to return to his present, the late 20th century, by altering events in the past for the better, with the aid of a hologram of his friend Admiral Al Calavicci (Stockwell), monitoring him from Sam's present.[2][3]
