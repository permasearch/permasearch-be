The twins were born in Sherman Oaks, California to David "Dave" Olsen[1] (b. 1953) and Jarnette "Jarnie" (nÃ©e Jones;[2] b. 1954). Despite being very similar in appearance, they are not identical, but sororal twins.[3] They have an elder brother, Trent, and a younger sister, actress Elizabeth, as well as a half-sister, Courtney Taylor, and a half-brother, Jake.[4] The twins' parents divorced in 1995; Taylor and Jake are from their father's second marriage to McKenzie.[5] The Olsen twins have English and Norwegian ancestry.[6]
