Burton was a computer programmer by trade.[5]Twenty-three years into his career and out of shape in his 40s, Burton went to get his blood checked. His cholesterol levels were poor, his blood pressure was high and he was a bit overweight.[1] He started to mountain bike and in 2008 established a bike shop in Saratoga Springs, Utah, called Epic Biking.[6] He finished the LOTOJA Classic six times and wanted to do more. He decided to set out on his Antarctic ride to inspire people and to encourage donations to the American Diabetes Association. He also wanted to ride in honor of his mother, whose high cholesterol contributed to her death on November 30, 2012.[1]
