Among the Tuareg, Songhai, Hausa, and Fulani of West Africa, women do not traditionally wear the veil, while men do. Male veiling was also common among the Berber Sanhaja tribes.[18] The North African male veil, which covers the mouth and sometimes part of the nose, is called litham is Arabic and tagelmust by the Tuareg.[18][19] Tuareg boys start wearing the veil at the onset of puberty and veiling is regarded as a mark of manhood.[19] It is considered improper for a man to appear unveiled in front of elders, especially those from his wife's family.[19]
