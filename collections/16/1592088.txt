Introduced as pets to the US during the 1990s, they are a popular exotic species pet even though Australia, from the 1960s onward, has banned the sale of its wildlife to the pet trade.[citation needed] They are a popular species among children because of their friendly and calm nature, and the relative ease of caring for them.[10] Generally speaking, the bearded dragon is a solitary animal. Male bearded dragons are usually housed alone, as they will fight with other males and breed with females. Captive adults reach about 40 to 61 cm (16 to 24 in) from head to tail, weigh 350 to 600 g (10 to 20 oz)[11] and live for about 8 to 12 years with good care.[2] They can live up to a maximum of 14 years in captivity.[12]
