Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus discovered the T-virus. Unfortunately, the virus had the side effect of sudden and uncontrollable mutation; in Cape Town, South Africa, a boy dies in a cable car ascending to Table Mountain, then suddenly reanimates and kills the other passengers. Marcus tried to have the program shut down, despite protests from his colleague Dr. Alexander Isaacs to continue to use it. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill Marcus. The Red Queen is then created using the images of Marcus's daughter from her childhood.
