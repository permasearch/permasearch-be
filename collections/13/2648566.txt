Balisong USA started manufacturing balisongs in the late-1970s, then changed its name to Pacific Cutlery in the early-1980s, before finally becoming Benchmade. The earlier knives featured a wide variety of custom blade designs (many of which were hand ground by master knifemaker Jody Samson, well-known for making the swords in the 1982 movie Conan the Barbarian), as well as a number of exotic inlays for the handles (ivory, prehistoric ivory, scrimshawed ivory, mother-of-pearl, ebony, tropical woods, etc.).[3]
