The term ietsism is becoming more widely used in Europe, as opposed to the phrase 'spiritual but not religious' which prevails in North America.[2][3] The word occurs inter alia in Dutch (ietsisme), German (Ietsismus), Russian (итсизм), Czech (něcismus), West Frisian (eatisme), Ukrainian (ітсизм) and Belarusian (іцызм).[citation needed]
