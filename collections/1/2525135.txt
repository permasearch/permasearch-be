Earl's Court was one of the most popular arenas to play in the UK, with a capacity of around 19,000 including standing room, meaning it was often chosen over other venues by bands with a large fan base. However, after the opening of the O2 Arena concert performances at Earl's Court were much rarer.[citation needed]
