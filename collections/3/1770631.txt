Hong Kong received its unique edition of the Lancer in 2008, dubbed the Lancer 2.0. The car comes in two trim levels, without a name for either of them. Both are equipped with the 4B11 2.0-liter engine, seven airbags, eight-speaker stereo system, adaptive front-lighting system (AFS) with HID as well as 18-inch alloy wheels. The upper trim has Ralliart style body kit which includes a revised front bumper, side skirt, rear bumper with diffuser and the addition of a correct-to-Evolution X rear spoiler, while the lower trim make do without the above-mentioned features.
