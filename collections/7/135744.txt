The round was supposed to end in December 1990, but the US and EU disagreed on how to reform agricultural trade and decided to extend the talks.[5] Finally, In November 1992, the US and EU settled most of their differences in a deal known informally as "the Blair House accord", and on April 15, 1994, the deal was signed by ministers from most of the 123 participating governments at a meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco.[6] The agreement established the World Trade Organization, which came into being upon its entry into force on January 1, 1995, to replace the GATT system.[2] It is widely regarded as the most profound institutional reform of the world trading system since the GATT's establishment.[7]
