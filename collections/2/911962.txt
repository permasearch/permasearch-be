In the first series, the cars were driven by former NASCAR driver Mike Skinner, known as "The American"; Amazon had requested that their test driver be American, according to the hosts. "The American" was portrayed with a stereotypical redneck accent and viewpoints, and prone to tangential speech and calling several things communist.[17][18] Due to poor reception, for series two Skinner was replaced by British racing driver Abbie Eaton.[19][1]
