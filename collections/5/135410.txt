The criteria for determining who has achieved human spaceflight vary. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) defines spaceflight as any flight above 100 kilometres (62 mi), a definition recognized by every country. In the 1960s, the United States Department of Defense awarded the rating of astronaut to military and civilian pilots who flew aircraft higher than 50 miles (80 km).[1] This list follows the FAI criterion.
