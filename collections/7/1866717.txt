Root Sports Northwest also holds the regional cable television rights to two Major League Soccer franchises - the Seattle Sounders FC and the Portland Timbers. The network airs a 30 minute live post-match show after every Timbers game , as well as weekly magazine shows for both teams - Sounders FC All Access and Timbers in 30. Many matches are shown in tape-delay due to overlapping with Seattle Mariners games.
