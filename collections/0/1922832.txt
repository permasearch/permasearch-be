The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[80] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[80][81] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[82] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[83] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[80] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[84]  Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[83][84]   MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[84]
