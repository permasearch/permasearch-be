Although adult red kites are sedentary birds, occupying their breeding home range all year in most cases, populations from Central and Northern Europe—although not the United Kingdom—may migrate south to areas such as Spain and the Iberian peninsula during colder winters.[16][17] Each nesting territory can contain up to five nest sites. Both male and female birds build the nest on a main fork or a limb high in a tree, 12–20 m (39–66 ft) above the ground. The nest is made of twigs and lined with grass or other vegetation and sheep’s wool.[12][17] At signs of danger, a mother will signal the young who will "play dead" when a predator is near.[18]
