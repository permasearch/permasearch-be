From 1809 to 1813, during the Napoleonic interlude, Ljubljana (under the name Laybach) was the capital of the Illyrian Provinces.[29][52] In 1813, the city became Austrian again and from 1815 to 1849 was the administrative center of the Kingdom of Illyria in the Austrian Empire.[53] In 1821, it hosted the Congress of Laibach, which fixed European political borders for years to come.[54][55] The first train arrived in 1849 from Vienna and in 1857 the line was extended to Trieste.[52]
