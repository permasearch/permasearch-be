The US Department of Defense DPAA gives dates for the Korean Conflict from June 27,1950 to January 31,1955.[61]Between June to October 1950, an estimated 700 civilian and US military POWs had been captured by the North Koreans. By August 1953 only 262 were still alive; one of the survivors was Private First Class Wayne A. "Johnnie" Johnson, who secretly documented the deaths of 496 military and civilian POWs. Johnson would later be awarded the Silver Star medal for valor in 1996.[62][63] In August 1953, General James Van Fleet, who had led US and UN forces in Korea, estimated that "a large percentage" of those service members listed as missing in action were alive.[64] (Coincidentally, General Van Fleet's own son Captain  James Alward Van Fleet Jr was MIA from a United States Air Force mission over North Korea April 4, 1952.)
