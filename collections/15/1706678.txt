A music video to accompany the release of "Perfect Strangers" was first released onto YouTube on 14 June 2016 at a total length of three minutes and twenty-seven seconds. The video is set and filmed in Cape Town in South Africa. It features a woman (Victoria Scholtz) always coincidentally meeting the same man (Devin Dollery) wherever she goes. They then ally together to help bring fun to the children in South Africa, with the man introducing them to skateboarding and the woman introducing them to breakdancing while falling in love in the process.[2]
