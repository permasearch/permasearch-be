Meanwhile, the demoralized anti-confederates became the provincial wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.[61] An extension of the Trans-Canada Highway became the first paved road across the island in 1966.

The goal was to demonstrate the changes during the Smallwood era in the province's economy and infrastructure.[66]
