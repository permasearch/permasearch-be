It is one of few ballads by Fall Out Boy. As said in an interview, Pete Wentz said that the song was written in thoughts of his friendship with the lead singer Patrick Stump. He wanted to show his fondness towards "one of his best friends in the business". Although the band were on hiatus (which stretched between 2009 and 2013), Wentz and Stump still supported each other's new music releases.
