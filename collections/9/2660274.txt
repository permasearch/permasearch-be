Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it a B: "Once Upon A Time is lucky to have the Disney connection, which puts the story in a context that their target audience knows very well, and the writers take advantage of the thrill viewers get when they see their favorite cartoon characters brought into three dimensions. This season started with introducing Mulan and Sleeping Beauty, but has since slowed down with the Disney character introductions. Now it’s time to work with the characters that are already on the board, and 'The Queen Is Dead' does strong work building up character motivations and moving pieces in place as the season nears its conclusion. It’s a Snow White-centric episode with a fairyback that looks at her mother’s final days; both Bailee Madison and Ginnifer Goodwin give genuine emotional performances that make Snow seem like a real human being, largely thanks to their chemistry with new character/cannon fodder Johanna."[4]
