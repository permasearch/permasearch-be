Since the 1980s, anarchism has grown into a strong political force in Latin America, with the development of Fejuve (1979),[163] CIPO-RFM (1980s),[164] Zapatistas (1994),[165] Horizontilidad (2001)[166] and the Oaxaca Uprising (2006).[167] Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.[168] Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight (G8) and the World Economic Forum (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocsâ€”other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.[168] A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.[168] According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism [...] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".[169]
