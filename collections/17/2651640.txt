In "The Night of the Doctor" (2013), it is shown that the Eighth Doctor regenerates into the War Doctor to fight in the Time War.[56] Many years later, as shown during "The Day of the Doctor" (2013) and also described by the Partisan in The End of Time, the War Doctor originally planned to use a Time Lord weapon known as the Moment to destroy the Time Lords and Daleks.[53][57] However, after being shown the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors during "The Day of the Doctor", he works together with them to change the assumed outcome of the Time War: thirteen incarnations of the Doctor team up together to freeze Gallifrey in time and place it outside of their universe, protecting it and the remaining Time Lords while the Daleks destroy themselves in their own crossfire once Gallifrey was gone. The War Doctor does not retain the memory of these events and spends centuries believing he burnt Gallifrey until the Eleventh Doctor's time because of the time streams being out of sync after meeting his future selves. Indeed, earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. After being informed that the plan to save Gallifrey is successful, the Eleventh Doctor has now set out to find Gallifrey and restore the Time Lords.[57]
