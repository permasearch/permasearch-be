The diagnosis is established clinically through characteristic anamnestic information (mostly short attacks of an intense sharp, piercing or electrifying pain with propagation along the occipital nerve from the lateral neck and under/behind the ear towards the side of the head and the eye, with often longer lasting background pain) and sometimes supporting clinical features (positive Hoffmann's sign, Dysesthesia).
