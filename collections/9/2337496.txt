This story[3] is based on how a mother's desire turns into disappointment. The five qualities she requires in her daughter-in-law are beauty, wisdom, romance, culinary skills and religious devotion.With the blessing of lord Shiva, Kanhaiya was married to Pari (meaning fairy- beautiful),Prarthana(meaning prayer), Panjiri(a kind of north Indian food), Prema(meaning love) and then Pratibha(talent) - with qualities matching with their names. The plot is inspired by the story of draupadi, who had requested Lord Shiva in her previous life to be granted a husband with great qualities, but erred by repeating each quality five times and therefore was granted the boon of five husbands.[4][5] The Paanchal family lives in Meerut.
