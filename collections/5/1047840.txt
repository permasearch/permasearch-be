The first season follows the odd pairing, with Todd serving as Dirk's reluctant sidekick, as they get to know each other while digging into the Spring murder investigation. As the story evolves during the season, it grows to include the disappearance of Spring's daughter Lydia, the secrets of the Spring family, hidden government operations, and a "holistic assassin" looking to kill Dirk.
