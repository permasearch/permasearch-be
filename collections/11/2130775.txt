Partly because of its central location, Birmingham is a major transport hub on the motorway, rail and canal networks.[216] The city is served by the M5, M6, M40, and M42 motorways, and probably the best known motorway junction in the UK: Spaghetti Junction.[217] The M6 passes through the city on the Bromford Viaduct, which at 3.5 miles (5.6Â km) is the longest bridge in the United Kingdom.[218]
