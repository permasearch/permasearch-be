In "PDA", Michael and Holly's public displays of affection make Kevin "horny". In a meeting about Public Displays of Affection, Dwight reads a list of names of employees who have had sex in the office, and Kevin adds his own name to the list, but Angela, doubting that he has, asks with who, only for Kevin to state that "she goes to another school". When Michael is worried that Holly might break up with him again, Kevin does a "monkey face" in an attempt to cheer him up. After Michael and Holly announce that they're moving in together and Oscar encourages them to kiss, Kevin says "Suck on that, Oscar" even though he was the one who told them to kiss.
