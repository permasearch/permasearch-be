When Timberlake began working on FutureSex/LoveSounds at Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia,[1][2] they had no idea of what the album would be like with no plan for it or even a title.[2] He told his collaborators to do a remake of his previous single, "Cry Me a River".[2] Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' and not in the sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [his album FutureSex/LoveSounds] to sound."[2]
