While playing for her high school basketball team, Rudolph was spotted by Ed Temple, Tennessee State's track and field coach, a major break for the promising young athlete. The day that Temple saw the tenth grader for the first time, he knew she was a natural athlete. Rudolph had already gained some track experience on Burt High School's track team two years earlier, mostly as a way to keep busy between basketball seasons.[13] As a high school sophomore Rudolph competed at Alabama's Tuskeegee Institute in her first major track event. Although she lost the race, Rudolph was determined to continue competing and win.[3]
