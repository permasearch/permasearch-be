Hari puzzles the authorities by refusing to say anything, even in his own defence (he has been sworn to secrecy by Daphne, and he honours that pledge to the letter).  Because the authorities cannot successfully prosecute him for rape, they instead imprison him under a wartime law as a suspected revolutionary.  And Daphne's refusal to aid a prosecution for rape leads to her being reviled and ostracized by the English community of Mayapore and of British India as a whole, where her case has become a cause célèbre.
