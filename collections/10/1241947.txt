In 2008, McCardell and the presidents of over 100 U.S. colleges and universities launched the Amethyst Initiative, a campaign to debate the effectiveness of present alcohol laws.[7] In 2008, Gallup reported that 77% of the population over 21 supported the 21-year drinking age.[8] As it stands, any state that lowers its alcohol purchase or possession age would lose ten percent of its federal highway funding.[9] This could range from a $6 million–150 million loss for any single state.
