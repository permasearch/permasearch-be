"Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies" (a.k.a. "Tiny Sparrow" or "Little Sparrow") (Roud #451) is an American folk music ballad, originating from the Appalachian region.[1] It has been recorded under either of its two title variations by numerous artists, including The Carter Family, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Odetta, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Kingston Trio, Leon Bibb, Makem and Clancy, Emmylou Harris, Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, The Rankin Family, The Country Gentlemen, Murray Head, Dolly Parton, and Gene Clark and Carla Olson.[2][3][4][5] The title of the song varies from recording to recording and prior to the 1960s, the song was usually known as "Tiny Sparrow" or "Little Sparrow". Some versions substituted the "Sparrow" with "Swallow," another form of species of bird. (SOURCE: Pete Seeger version of the song). In more recent times, the song's title sometimes finds "Maidens" substituted for "Ladies," and "Come All Ye" or "Come All You" sometimes omitted.[6]
