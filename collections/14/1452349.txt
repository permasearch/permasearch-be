The original storyline designed for J.T. and Colleen centered around an unrequited crush she feels for him.[19] Luckinbill and Fonseca, the first actress to portray Colleen, thought their character's relationship would progress no further than friendship.[20][21] Fonseca said that if they became a couple, the fun brought on by the "tug-and-pull" element between them could disappear.[20] Luckinbill considered the age difference too great an obstacle to overcome, as at the time, J.T. was 18 years old and Colleen was 15.[21][22] Smith later pushed for the plot to be taken further and the characters were paired romantically.[19] Both soap opera critics and members of the show's cast and crew considered this a controversial and surprising move.[22] Fonseca stated she "wasn't expecting it at all", and admitted that even former executive producer David Shaughnessy found the pairing "shocking".[19]
