Brazil first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920,[1] after missing the previous five Summer editions. The country has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1928 Games. As of 2016, Brazilian athletes have won a total of 129 medals in 15 different Summer sports. Brazil has also participated in the Winter Olympic Games since 1992, though to this date no Brazilian athlete has won an Olympic medal in winter sports. The country's best result at the Winter Olympics was a ninth-place finish achieved by snowboarder Isabel Clark Ribeiro at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Since Brazil is mostly a tropical nation, the country's most important results so far have been achieved at the Summer editions.
