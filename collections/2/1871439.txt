Vietnam's economic policy following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has been a cautious one, emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth. While the country shifted toward a more market-oriented economy, the Vietnamese government still continues to hold a tight reign over major state sectors, such as the banking system, state-owned enterprises and foreign trade.[23] GDP growth fell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999.
