Stephanie Hall of KSiteTV also gave a good review to the episode stating that the flashbacks were a nice addition to the reveal of information. "Balancing the primary information-heavy storyline with the secondary emotional one, "The Cell" was a well-rounded hour that managed to jump start one intriguing plot and seemingly end an appropriate one. An interesting episode in a different capacity than the few weeks prior, this one felt low-key in all the right ways. "The Cell" perfectly set the scene for future emotional payoffs and twisted new problems."[6]
