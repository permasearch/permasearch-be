Like Kitty, Red is often forced to act as a parental figure for Eric's friends Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), Jackie (Mila Kunis), Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Donna (Laura Prepon)â€”albeit reluctantly. He usually only helps out at Kitty's insistence or simply to get the teens out of his house. Red actually likes Donna, mostly because he thinks that if Eric has a son with her he will be good at sports and both freely and cheerily admits she is too good for his own son, and also that if Eric and Donna get married Eric will leave the house. Red has a low opinion of Kelso and Fez, calling Kelso a "Kettlehead" and referring to Fez as the "foreign kid", and sometimes by the generic names of "Haji", "Sabu", "Ali Baba", "Tutankhamun" or "Anwar". However, he has bonded with them both a few times throughout the series, such as when he cooperated with Kelso to change the Pong electronic game so they can make the paddles smaller, thus making the game more fun. Red also bonded with Fez when he gave Fez advice that it is not a good idea to mix women and alcohol together. Early on, Red stated that Jackie is his favorite out of all of Eric's friends. He says unlike the others, she is "not useless" because she perfectly held a flashlight for him while he worked on his car, while Eric was incapable of this simple task. Jackie has hugged Red on a few occasions, at least half of which he returned.
