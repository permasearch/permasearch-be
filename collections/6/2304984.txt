In 1936, Governor Herbert H. Lehman signed a bill that authorized the construction of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, which would connect Queens and the Bronx.[7] At its north end, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge would connect to Eastern Boulevard (later known as Bruckner Boulevard) via the Hutchinson River Parkway.[8] At its south end, the bridge would connect to a new Whitestone Parkway, which led southwest off the bridge to Northern Boulevard.[8][9] Plans for the bridge were completed by February 1937, at which time the state started issuing bonds to fund bridge construction.[10] The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority was to construct the span.[11] Moses argued that the TBTA and the city should each be responsible for half of the bridge's $17.5 million cost.[1]
