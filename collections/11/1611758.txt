Legally, the term "child" may refer to anyone below the age of majority or some other age limit.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines child as "a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier".[5] This is ratified by 192 of 194 member countries.  The term "child" may also refer to someone below another legally defined age limit unconnected to the age of majority.  In Singapore, for example, a "child" is legally defined as someone under the age of 14 under the "Children and Young Persons Act" whereas the age of majority is 21.[6][7]  In U.S. Immigration Law, a child refers to anyone who is under the age of 21.[8]
