The TT RS has a new short-shift close-ratio six-speed manual transmission,[41] and like all "RS" models, is only available with Audi's 'trademark' quattro four-wheel-drive system, with the TT RS using a specially adapted version of the latest generation multi-plate clutch from Haldex Traction.[41][44] Additions to the quattro system include a constant velocity joint before the cardan propeller shaft, and a compact rear-axle differential – upgraded to cope with the increased torque from the five-cylinder turbo engine.
