The Pan Borneo Highway connects Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei. The road has been poorly maintained since it was built. The narrow road is dark at night without any street lights and there are many danger spots, sharp bends, blind spots, potholes, and erosion.[29] However, federal government funds have been allocated for the upgrade of the highway, which will be carried out in stages until completion in 2025.[30]
