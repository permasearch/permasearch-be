There are criticisms of QALY. One involves QALY's lack of usefulness to the healthcare provider in determining the applicability of alternative treatments in the individual patient environment,[3] and the absence of incorporating the patient's willingness to pay (i.e. behavioral economics) in decisions to finance new treatments.[4]   Another criticism involves age; elderly individuals are assumed to have lower QALYs since they do not have as many years to influence the calculation of the measurement; so comparing a health intervention's impact on a teenager's QALYs to an older individual's QALYs may not be considered "fair" since age is such an important factor. Specific health outcomes may also be difficult to quantify, thus making it difficult to compare all factors that may influence an individual's QALY. Example: Comparing an intervention's impact on the livelihood of a single woman to a mother of three; QALYs do not take into account the importance that an individual person may have for others' lives.
