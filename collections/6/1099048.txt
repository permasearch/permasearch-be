In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) was formed to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a proposal was made to the War Office for the formation of a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigadeâ€”a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions.[114] Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries.[114] In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry.[114] They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads[114] and from the flanks[115] of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.[114]
