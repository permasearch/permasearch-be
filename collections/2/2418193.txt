The three-tiered Victorian members' pavilion was built in 1895 for £10,000.[11] Hit by a bomb in 1940 – which destroyed the Members' Dining Room and groundsman's quarters – most of the pavilion was rebuilt.[15] £1 million was spent on a new roof after it began to leak in 2003.[21] It is currently undergoing renovation, due to be completed in 2013, when it is envisaged that the players will be housed in the new 'Media and Players' stand, leaving the pavilion solely for the use of members.
