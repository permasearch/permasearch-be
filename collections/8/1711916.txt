In the Assassin format, players are randomly assigned "targets" to defeat, such as via shuffle of basic land cards. Players score points for delivering the finishing blow to their assigned target as well as being the last survivor. Defeating another player grants you their "contract", and thus a new target to attack. Formats differ on what drawing your own contract means — whether it be a reshuffle (if at start of the game) or a "wild card" that allows you to gain points for any player defeated.[45][46]
