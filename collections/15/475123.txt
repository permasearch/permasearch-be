Upon taking office in February 1917, Baker familiarized himself with the redesign of the quarter.  After conferring with other Treasury officials, he decided that the redesign would be in violation of the 1890 act, and would require legislation from Congress.  McAdoo concurred, and wrote to Representative William A. Ashbrook (Democrat-Ohio) on April 16, 1917.  Ashbrook was not only chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, he was a noted coin collector.  McAdoo explained the need for the redesign, "since the original dies were made the artist has found that they are not true to the original design and that a great improvement can be made in the artistic value and appearance of the coin by making the slight changes the act contemplates".[49]
