Allen Divers of Anime News Network comments that the male character designs of One Piece are "often quite varied and unique", while the female ones become "a bit repetitive". He also notes that, as the characters are "defined by what they seek", there is little room "for actual development".[63] Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk simply states that the series' characters have a lot of "charm".[64] His colleague Carl Kimlinger describes the visual style of One Piece as "unconventional" with "grotesquely exaggerated expressions, simple eyes, big mouths and bigger teeth", "supremely ugly supporting characters and skinny, gangly-limbed main cast" and comments that "it's all amazingly distinctive, utterly appropriate, and surprisingly coolâ€”in a goofy kind of way". He also notes that "Funimation's English dub is light-years better than the 4Kids debacle", "unusually accurate, professional, and largely enjoyable, which is far, far more than can be said of the previous dub". He laments that Funimation's version of "Crocodile loses his sepulchral charisma" and that "the original's fine dance on the edge of mawkish sentimentality is disrupted often enough by less-than-stellar acting". He also states that "Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool."[65]
