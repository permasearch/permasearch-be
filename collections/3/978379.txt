The Three Treasures can also refer to jing, qi and shen (Chinese: 精氣神; pinyin: jīng-qì-shén; jing is usually translated with "essence" and shen with "spirit"). These terms are elements of the traditional Chinese concept of the human body, which shares its cosmological foundation — Yinyangism or the Naturalists — with Taoism. Within this framework, they play an important role in neidan ("Taoist Inner Alchemy").[72]
