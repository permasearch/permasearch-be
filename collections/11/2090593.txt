In July 1959, del Río and Pedro Armendáriz began the rehearsals of the play The Road to Rome by Robert E. Sherwood, but Armendariz had a personality clash with the director and retired. Wolf Ruvinskis replaced him. The public did not like the play and was withdrawn from the billboard.[81] In early 1962, Dolores prepared for the stage production of Ghosts by playwright Henrik Ibsen. She played the role of Mrs. Alving, a litmus test for any actress. The work was released on 4 May 1962 and she received a warm ovation for her performance.[82]
