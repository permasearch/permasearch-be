Although the high blood solubility of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situationsâ€”it persists in the lipid compartment of the body for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period.[17][21] There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses.[3][4][5][6][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation,[4] and it has been used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments.[7] During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.[28]
