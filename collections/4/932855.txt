Several residents had seen Fannin march from Goliad and sent messengers to Bexar to inform Santa Anna that Fannin and 300 men were headed for the Alamo. Santa Anna ordered Colonel Juan Almonte and 800 dragoons to intercept the Texian relief force.[96] Unaware of Fannin's attempted relief mission, Travis sent James Bonham to Goliad to persuade him.[97] Bonham was asked to tie a white handkerchief around his hat when he returned so that the Texians would know to open the gates for him.[98]
