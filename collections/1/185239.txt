The South American market Fiesta was facelifted in early 2007 as a 2008 model, with new rectangular headlights and grille. In early 2010 the Fiesta was facelifted as a 2011 model, with new headlights and grille, very similar to those on the mark VI Fiesta available in other markets around the world, but keeping all other features nearly the same as the previous model. Its name varies from country to country, called "Fiesta One" in Argentina, "Fiesta Move" in Venezuela, and "Fiesta Rocam" in Brazil.[12][13][14]
