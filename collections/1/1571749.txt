However, on August 1, 2014, a California appeals court ruled the hotel tax unconstitutional, jeopardizing the financing scheme for the convention center expansion, forcing the city to either appeal the decision, seek ballot approval for the tax in accordance with the court's ruling, or come up with an entirely new financing scheme.[27] Attorney Cory Briggs was the filing attorney for the successful lawsuit, and has another lawsuit filed regarding the bay front nature of the proposed expansion.[28] The decision was not appealed by the San Diego City Council.[29] The effort to expand the convention center up to August 2014 expended $10 million.[30] Due to the lawsuit, other cities have contacted Comic-Con International regarding the possibility of relocating away from San Diego.[31] In 2015, the Coast Commission again approved the convention center expansion plan.[32] By 2017, plans to expand the convention center began again.[33]
