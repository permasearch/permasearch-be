In 2015, Supergirl debuted on CBS, focusing on the life of Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) as a 24-year-old cousin of Superman, who works by day as an assistant to Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) in National City. The series's story focuses on Kara learning to be a hero and working with the Department of Extranormal Operations to combat alien and metahuman threats. The series is produced by Greg Berlanti, which allowed the series to cross over with Berlanti's show on The CW, The Flash, which is part of the Arrowverse fictional universe, for an episode which established that Supergirl takes place in a parallel universe to that of The Flash. After its cancellation by CBS, The CW picked up the show for season two, leading Berlanti to promise a four-way crossover with Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow. The show has continued this trend in later episodes, with Supergirl receiving a dimensional transporter that allows her to visit the primary Arrowverse Earth whenever she wishes, either to seek or provide aid or simply to be a friend.
