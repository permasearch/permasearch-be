There are two levels of exemption from the gift tax. First, gifts of up to the annual exclusion ($14,000 per recipient in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017[7]) incur no tax or filing requirement. By splitting their gifts, married couples can give up to twice this amount tax-free. Note that each giver and recipient pair has their own unique annual exclusion; a giver can give to any number of recipients and the exclusion is not affected by other gifts that recipient may have received from others.
