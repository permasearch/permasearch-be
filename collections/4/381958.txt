Fecal porphyrin quantification by HemoQuant can yield a false positive result due to exogenous blood and various porphyrins. HemoQuant is the most sensitive test for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and therefore may be most appropriate fecal occult blood test to use in the evaluation of iron deficiency[51] Advised to stop red meat and aspirin for three days prior to specimen collection[52] False positives can occur with myoglobin, catalase, or protohemes[53] and in certain types of porphyria.[citation needed]
