Four days after the event was recorded, the progenitor star was tentatively identified as Sanduleak −69° 202, a blue supergiant.[8] After the supernova faded, that identification was definitely confirmed by Sanduleak −69° 202 having disappeared. This was an unexpected identification, because models of high mass stellar evolution at the time did not predict that blue supergiants are susceptible to a supernova event. Many models of the progenitor have since attributed the color to its chemical composition, particularly the low levels of heavy elements, among other factors.[9] There was some speculation that the star might have merged with a companion star before the supernova.[10] However, it is now widely understood that blue supergiants are natural progenitors of supernovae, although there is still speculation that the evolution of such stars requires mass loss involving a binary companion.[11] It is of note that the supernova of the blue giant Sanduleak −69° 202 was about one-tenth as luminous as the average observed type II supernova, which is associated with the denser makeup of the star. Because blue supergiant supernovae are not as bright as those generated by red supergiants, we cannot see them in as large a volume. We would thus not expect to see as many of them, and so they might not be as rare or unusual as previously thought.[citation needed]
