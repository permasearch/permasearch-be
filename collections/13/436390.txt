In January 2007, the EMF purchased 94.3 WJKL Elgin, Illinois, which broadcasts to the Chicago area, for $17 million.[22] Shortly after the purchase, a flood hit the WJKL transmitter site that knocked the station off the air for more than a week.[23] WJKL has since moved and now broadcasts from Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois to the Chicago market.[24] On November 30, 2007, K-Love purchased 97.3 KCXM, which was an ESPN radio affiliate for Kansas City, for $16 million.[25] The call letters were changed to KLRX shortly after and now broadcasts from Lee's Summit to the Kansas City area.[26] As a result, these and other station purchases, plus the new translators approved during the 2003 filing window, the K-Love radio network grew to be the largest broadcaster of contemporary Christian music in the world.[27] By 2010, K-Love had an estimated listenership of 6 million people,[28] from both terrestrial stations and on-line streams.
