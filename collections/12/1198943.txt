A number of new characters were created for Series 4 to fill out the cast list again. Following his guest appearances in Series 3 Tim Healy became a full-time cast member as barman Les, with his son Liam (Adam Gillen) tagging along to Benidorm for a cheap holiday. A whiff of a Benidorm holiday romance was soon in the air for Liam, as he took an immediate shine to new girl Natalie (Kathryn Drysdale) - but her friend Sam (Shelley Longworth) has other ideas on their potential romance.
