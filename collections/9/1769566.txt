Fleetwood Mac performed at Verizon Arena May 4, 2013 with surprise guests former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton attending the show. Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood introduced the couple, who were seated in an arena suite, to the sold-out audience and dedicated the song "Don't Stop" to them, which was appropriately Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign song.
