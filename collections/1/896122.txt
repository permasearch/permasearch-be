Carmel-by-the-Sea is an exceptionally dog-friendly city.  Most hotels allow dogs to stay with guests.  Almost all restaurants that offer outside dining allow dogs in those areas, with most of them also offering water.  A few have special "doggie menus."  Many retailers allow dogs to accompany their owners in their stores and many have treats available.  Water bowls and dog biscuits can also be found in front of many stores.  Dogs are not permitted, however, in Devendorf Park (on Ocean Ave. between Junipero and Mission Streets).  Dogs must be leashed, except on Carmel City Beach, where they are allowed unleashed if they are under voice command from their owners.  The police department takes animal welfare seriously and officers will open cars that contain pets without adequate ventilation or water and will remove the pets and cite the owner.[56]
