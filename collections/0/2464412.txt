An incarnation of the Cotton Club opened on 125th Street in Harlem on December 12, 1977.[22] James Haskins wrote at the time, "Today, there is a new incarnation of the Cotton Club which sits on the most western end of the 125th Street under the massive Manhattanville viaduct. The windowless block of a building has a less dramatic display out front but seems to be popular with tourists for Sunday jazz brunches."[23]
