The updated Traverse moves away from its egg-shaped design to a more trucklike design similar to the Tahoe (Chevrolet is also touting it as a Midsize SUV because it is closer to the Tahoe than it is to a CUV but still in reality a CUV as its FWD and AWD based unlike the Tahoe that is RWD and 4X4 based) while taking the same cues from the now-midsize Acadia, with the Chevrolet front grille design (the same grille as the Equinox) now used and rear lights redesigned. While similar in dimension to the first generation model, it adds an extra 2.0 inches of wheelbase and 0.7 inch more overall length, while it loses 111 pounds overall to come in at a weight of 4362 pounds, thus retaining its status as an 8-seat (or 7-seat optional) passenger vehicle.
