The late Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse.[51] Three Pictish symbol stones have been found on Skye and a fourth on Raasay.[52] More is known of the kingdom of Dál Riata to the south; Adomnán's life of Columba, written shortly before 697, portrays the saint visiting Skye (where he baptised a pagan leader using an interpreter[53]) and Adomnán himself is thought to have been familiar with the island.[54] The Irish annals record a number of events on Skye in the later 7th and early 8th centuries – mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the background to the Old Irish language romance Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin.[55]
