The payoff schedules for most video poker machines are configured with a pay schedule that pays proportionally more for certain hands (such as a royal flush) when the maximum number of credits (typically 5 coins) is bet.  Therefore, players who do not play with the maximum number of credits at a time are playing with a smaller theoretical return.
