In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed "Le Pig" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's "family" murdered Sharon Tate,[47] wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends.[4][11]:42 It was used for the band to record Broken, an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records[48] and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200.[49] In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound.[50] He characterized Broken as a guitar-based "blast of destruction", and as "a lot harderÂ ... than Pretty Hate Machine".[21] The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza.[51] Songs from Broken earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single "Happiness in Slavery" from Woodstock '94,[52] and the second single "Wish".[52] In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for "Wish", Reznor joked that "Wish" became "the only to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics."[53] Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.[11]:42
