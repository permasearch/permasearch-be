Peru, including an area of the central Andes stretching from Ecuador to northern Chile, has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating to roughly 10,000 BCE.[41]  Prior to the emergence of ceramics in this region around 1850 BCE, cave paintings and beads have been found.  These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9500 BCE in the Toquepala Caves.[42]  Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200 BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces.[43]
