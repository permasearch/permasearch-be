In 1898 Thomson recommended Rutherford for a position at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. He was to replace Hugh Longbourne Callendar who held the chair of Macdonald Professor of physics and was coming to Cambridge.[16] Rutherford was accepted, which meant that in 1900 he could marry Mary Georgina Newton (1876–1954)[17][18] to whom he had become engaged before leaving New Zealand; they married at St Paul's Anglican Church, Papanui in Christchurch,[19][20] they had one daughter, Eileen Mary (1901–1930), who married Ralph Fowler. In 1901 he gained a DSc from the University of New Zealand.[15] In 1907 Rutherford returned to Britain to take the chair of physics at the Victoria University of Manchester.
