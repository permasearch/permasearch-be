It is a general principle that the accused is entitled to be released on bail at any stage prior to his conviction if the court is satisfied that the interests of justice so permit. This principle, enshrined in the Constitution,[58] is restated in the CPA.[59] Bail lapses on conviction, unless specifically extended.[60] The court must raise the issue of bail if it has not already been raised by the prosecutor or by the accused.[61]
