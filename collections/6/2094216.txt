The distance of the viewer from the display surface,       e   z     {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{z}}  , directly relates to the field of view, where     α = 2 ⋅  tan  − 1   ⁡ ( 1  /    e   z   )   {\displaystyle \alpha =2\cdot \tan ^{-1}(1/\mathbf {e} _{z})}   is the viewed angle. (Note: This assumes that you map the points (-1,-1) and (1,1) to the corners of your viewing surface)
