The transmission distance of a fiber-optic communication system has traditionally been limited by fiber attenuation and by fiber distortion.  By using opto-electronic repeaters, these problems have been eliminated. These repeaters convert the signal into an electrical signal, and then use a transmitter to send the signal again at a higher intensity than was received, thus counteracting the loss incurred in the previous segment.  Because of the high complexity with modern wavelength-division multiplexed signals (including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20Â km), the cost of these repeaters is very high.
