Son Gohan (孫悟飯) is Goku's first son with Chi-Chi, who first appears at the age of four years.[ch. 196] He is then kidnapped by Goku's brother, Raditz, and locked up in a space pod. However, his temper flares and he bursts out of the space pod, dealing a blow to Raditz, but also knocking himself out. After the battle, Piccolo takes and trains him for a year as he realizes Gohan's potential.[ch. 205] Gohan slowly becomes one of the strongest characters in the series, at one point holding his own against Freeza and eventually defeats Cell. During the Majin Boo arc he forms a relationship with Videl, with whom at the end of the series he has a daughter named Pan.[ch. 518]
