In April 2005, Lucas and Davis commented that a television series acting as a sequel was under consideration.[37] In June 2008, Davis reiterated his hopes to return for a theatrically-released second installment of the film.[38] On February 15, 2013 Val Kilmer posted a photo via Twitter implying that it was "Right around the corner!".[39] However, this coincided with a Life's Too Short mockumentary featuring Davis and Kilmer, and is likely to have been a hoax. In March 2013, Davis indicated an interest in seeing a sequel (perhaps as a TV series), but gave no indication that any development was ongoing.[40] In September 2016, Warwick Davis went on record again in stating that he would not like to see a remake of Willow but he would like to see a sequel that explores if Willow became a sorcerer or not and what happened to Elora Danan when she grew up.[41]
