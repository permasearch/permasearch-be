In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
