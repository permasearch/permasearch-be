The various school bands compete for points throughout camp with East Great Falls leading on the last day, but an ill-fated prank by Matt that was intended for the rival team causes the band to lose and Elyse to lose a chance at a scholarship. Once the new term starts, Matt visits with Chuck, who reveals that he and the rest of Steve Stifler's friends really couldn't stand him, and begins to fix his mistakes by deleting the naked videos he took of others at band camp, reconcile with his band camp buddies and then persuades the school band to play Elyse's piece to the Conservatory head, winning Elyse a scholarship (Brandon had been disqualified for plagiarism), and Matt her affection.
