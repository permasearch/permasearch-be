Return to the Earth is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites.[13] Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006.[14] The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in Clinton, Oklahoma.[14][15]
