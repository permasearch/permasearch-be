Cape Verde has bilateral relations with some Lusophone nations and holds membership in a number of international organisations.[14] It also participates in most international conferences on economic and political issues.[14] Since 2007, Cape Verde has a special partnership status[19] with the EU, under the Cotonou Agreement, and might apply for special membership, even because the Cape Verdean escudo, the country's currency, is indexed to the Euro.[20] In 2011 Cape Verde ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.[21]
