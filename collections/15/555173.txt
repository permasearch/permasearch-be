The story first appeared in the May 1841 edition of Graham's Magazine, published in April.[5] Poe rushed to complete the story in time and later admitted that the conclusion was imperfect.[6] Shortly after Poe's story "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" was translated into French without acknowledgment, French readers were seeking out other Poe works and "A Descent into the MaelstrÃ¶m" was amongst the earliest translated.[7]
