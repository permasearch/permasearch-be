Jones did not participate in the Bearsâ€™ voluntary off season program in 2006, opting instead to work out on his own, leading to Benson lining up with the first team during workouts. On, July 27, 2006, Jones injured his hamstring during a physical at the Bears' summer camp; Lovie Smith announced Jones would fall behind Cedric Benson on the depth chart.[3] However, on August 4, Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine practice drill, and Jones returned to his featured back position.
