Dreams are brief compared to the range and abundance of dream thoughts. Through condensation, or compression, dream content can be presented in one dream. Often times, people may recall having more than one dream in a night. Freud explained that the content of all dreams occurring on the same night represents part of the same whole.[13] He believed that separate dreams have the same meaning, though often the first dream is more distorted, and the latter is more confident and distinct. Displacement of dream content occurs when the manifest content hardly resembles the actual meaning of the dream thought. Displacement comes about through the influence of the censorship agent. Representation in dreams represents the causal relations between two things. Freud argues that two persons or objects can be combined into a single representation in a dream (see Freud's dream of his uncle and Friend R).[14]
