Early in the fifth-season episode "Exposed" of the television series Smallville, former Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat (Luke Duke), playing Kansas Senator Jack Jennings, old friend of Jonathan Kent, played by John Schneider (Bo Duke), fishtails his car into the Kent farmyard. The car is a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T, painted blue instead of orange, and lacking the General Lee's distinctive insignia.
