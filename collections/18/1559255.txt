An Anglican writer says that, "To achieve union but not children by means of contraceptives and to achieve children but not union by means of artificial insemination are both equally wrong."[26] Heterosexual intercourse is viewed by the Catholic Church as an act meant to be experienced only by married couples; it is viewed as a physical representation of the spiritual unity of marriage between a husband and wife. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, artificial insemination "dissociates the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by two persons giving themselves to one another, but one that 'entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is, in itself, contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children'".[27]
