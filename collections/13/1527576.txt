The office of Datu was normally passed on through heredity,[4] and even in cases where it was not passed on through direct descent, only a fellow member of the aristocratic class could ascend to the position.[4]  In large settlements (called Bayan among the Tagalogs) in which several datus and their barangays lived in close proximity, Paramount Datus were chosen by datus from amongst themselves in a more democratic way, but even this position as most senior among datus was often passed on through heredity.[3]
