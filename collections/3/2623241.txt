There are three types of Federal courts-martialâ€”summary, special, and general.  A conviction at a general court-martial is equivalent to a civilian felony conviction in a federal district court or a state criminal trial court.  Special courts-martial are considered "federal misdemeanor courts" akin to district state courts, because they cannot impose confinement longer than one year. Summary courts-martial have no civilian equivalent, other than perhaps to noncriminal magistrate's proceedings, in that they have been declared by the US Supreme Court to be administrative in nature, because there is no right to counsel, though as a benefit, the Air Force provides such to Airmen so charged. Enlisted personnel must consent to a trial by summary court-martial and officers may not be tried in such proceedings. A summary court conviction is legally deemed to be akin to an Article 15 proceeding.
