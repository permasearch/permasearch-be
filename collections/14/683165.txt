Cort and Ashley (Daniel Booko and Teresa Castillo) are two teenagers hired as interns in the episode "iHire An Idiot". Cort was hired by Carly and Sam without Freddie's approval. Ashley was another intern hired by Freddie without Carly or Sam's permission, and this leads to Carly and Sam trying to get him to fire Ashley. Freddie proclaims that Carly and Sam have to fire Cort first and then he will fire Ashley, but this does not happen until the end of the episode. At the end, it is revealed that Cort was kicked out of college because he was claimed to be dangerously stupid. It is also revealed that, unlike Cort, Ashley is actually intelligent and works at the Brilliance Bar at the local Pear Computers store (Freddie makes her act stupid to trick Carly and Sam into firing Cort). Cort is later mentioned in "iOMG". It is implied that Cort and Ashley dated after the end of "iHire an Idiot".
