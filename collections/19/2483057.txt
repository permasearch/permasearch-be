In the summer of 2008, the National Lottery ran its first Millionaire Raffle. These special, limited edition raffles have been held several times a year since then. Two Millionaire Raffle draws were held in 2011 and three in 2012.[13] For the Easter 2013 Millionaire Raffle, 200,000 tickets were available, costing €20 each. The raffle had a top prize of €1 million, a second prize of €250,000, and two third prizes of €100,000. Players could also win a range of smaller prizes ranging from €10,000 to €250. In 2016 this was increased to 500,000 tickets, still costing €20 each and having a similar breakdown of prizes. Professional footballer Kevin O'Connor won the 2017 Christmas Millionaire Raffle.[28]
