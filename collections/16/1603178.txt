The subregion of Midwestern Ontario consists of the Counties of Huron, Bruce, Grey, and Perth.  The "Queen's Bush" as the area was called, did not experience communication with Southwestern and Central dialects until the early 20th century.  Thus, a strong accent similar to Central Ontarian is heard, yet many different phrasings exist.  It is typical in the area to drop phonetic sounds to make shorter contractions, such as: Prolly (Probably), Goin' (Going), and "Wuts goin' on tonight?  D'ya wanna do sumthin'?"  It is particularly strong in the County of Bruce, so much that it is commonly referred to as being the Bruce Cownian (Bruce Countian) accent. Also 'er' sounds are often pronounced 'air', with "were" sounding more like "wear".
