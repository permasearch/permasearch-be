Most National Historic Sites are marked by a federal plaque bearing Canada's Coat of Arms.[44] In earlier years, these plaques were erected on purpose-built cairns,[10] and in later years have been attached to buildings or free-standing posts. These maroon and gold markers are typically in English and French, though some are trilingual where another language is relevant to the subject being commemorated.[45]
