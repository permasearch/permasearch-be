Formic acid is readily metabolized and eliminated by the body. Nonetheless, it has specific toxic effects; the formic acid and formaldehyde produced as metabolites of methanol are responsible for the optic nerve damage, causing blindness seen in methanol poisoning.[39] Some chronic effects of formic acid exposure have been documented. Some experiments on bacterial species have demonstrated it to be a mutagen.[40] Chronic exposure in humans may cause kidney damage.[40] Another possible effect of chronic exposure is development of a skin allergy that manifests upon re-exposure to the chemical.
