After a difficult first season in England, De Gea said, "There have been doubts in the first season but I always had faith in my ability. The pressure at an elite club like United is huge but Ferguson just told me to do what I did at AtlÃ©tico. You have to be as strong when things go wrong but I don't get nervous. Mistakes are normal; everyone makes them."[54] His goalkeeping rival Lindegaard, however, promised to fight for the place he lost via injury, saying, "I want the number one spot because I am the best. I am sure he is a bit in front right now because he did well last season, so I need to take every chance I get to prove myself worthy of the number one spot."[55] De Gea later admitted that he thought about leaving after the first season.[56]
