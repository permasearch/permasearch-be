Dolphin Tale is a 2011 American 3D family drama film directed by Charles Martin Smith (his first since 2008), from a screenplay by Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi and a book of the same name. It stars Nathan Gamble, Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, Cozi Zuehlsdorff in her film debut, and Morgan Freeman.[5] The book and film are inspired by the true story of Winter, a bottlenose dolphin that was rescued in December 2005 off the Florida coast and taken in by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Winter lost her tail after becoming entangled with a rope attached to a crab trap, and was fitted with a prosthetic one.[6] The film was released on September 23, 2011, by Warner Bros. Pictures; Dolphin Tale received positive reviews from critics and earned $95.9 million[4] on a $37 million[3] budget. A sequel, Dolphin Tale 2, was released on September 12, 2014.[7]
