The 2017 event was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the TRNSMT festival which takes place on the same weekend at Glasgow Green. The 2017 festival was a success with a follow-up for 2018 in the pipeline, meaning that T in the Park is "not looking likely" for 2018.[1]
