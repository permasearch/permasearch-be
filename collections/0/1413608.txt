Prevalence of the disorder worldwide is estimated to be between 4% and 10%, with reports as low as 2.2% and as high as 17.8%. Variation in rate of diagnoses may be attributed to differences between populations (i.e., culture), and differences in diagnostic methodologies.[27] Prevalence of ADHD among females is less than half that of males, and females more commonly fall into the inattentive subtype.[28]
