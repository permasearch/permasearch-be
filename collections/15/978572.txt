Fourth stage saw the completion of Line 6 from Instituto del Petróleo to eastern terminal Martín Carrera and Line 7 to the north from Tacuba to El Rosario. Line 9 was the only new line built during this stage. It originally ran from Pantitlán to Centro Médico, and its expansion to Tacubaya was completed on August 29, 1988. For Line 9, a circular deep-tunnel and an elevated track were used.
