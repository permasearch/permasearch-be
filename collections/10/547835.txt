With the Test series lost, England were keen to regain some honour in the T20 and ODIs which remained. After taking 3 for 48 in 8 overs in a warm-up match against the WIPA President's Select XI,[111] Anderson led the England attack in the T20 international. Despite finishing with decent figures of 1–19 in 3 overs,[112] England were beaten soundly.[113] The first One-Day International, however, saw England inflict their first defeat on the West Indies of the tour. After posting 270 for 7 in their 50 overs,[114] Rain interrupted the West Indies' reply, leading to the result being decided on the Duckworth–Lewis method. With the light fading, Anderson succeeded in having Kieron Pollard caught on the boundary by Steve Harmison. Due to the intricacies of the D/L system, this wicket ensured England won the match by a single run.[115]
