The volcano lies on, and is a product of, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which runs 900 kilometers (560 mi) west-to-east across central Mexico. It includes the Sierra Nevada mountain range (a set of extinct volcanoes) as well as thousands of cinder cones and volcanic vents. Volcanic activity here has created the Central Mexican Plateau and rock deposits up to 1.8 kilometers (1.1 mi) deep. It has also created fertile soils by the widespread deposition of ash and thereby some of Mexico’s most productive farmland.[9] The volcanic activity here is a result of the subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates along the Middle America Trench.[10] More specifically, the volcano is the youngest of the approximately 1,400 volcanic vents of the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field, a 40,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq mi) basalt plateau filled with scoria cones like Parícutin, along with small shield volcanoes, maars, tuff rings and lava domes.[10][11] Scoria cones are the most common type of volcano in Mexico, appearing suddenly and building a cone-shaped mountain with steep slopes before going extinct. Parícutin's immediate predecessor was El Jorullo, also in Michoacán, which erupted in 1759.[9][12]
