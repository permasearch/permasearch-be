The logo has undergone minor changes from its original design in 1971, today most commonly seen as a solo swoosh, although for much of its history, the logo incorporated the NIKE name alongside the Swoosh. Over the years, the red and white color palette has traditionally been used on the logo, although most recently a solid black swoosh has gained significant popularity.[4]
