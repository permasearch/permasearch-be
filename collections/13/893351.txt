Within an ecological food chain, Consumers are categorized into primary consumers, secondary consumers, and the tertiary consumers.[2] Primary consumers are herbivores, feeding on plants. Secondary consumers, on the other hand, are carnivores, and prey on other animals. Omnivores, who feed on both plants and animals, can also be considered a secondary consumer. Tertiary consumers, sometimes also known as apex predators, are usually at the top of food chains, capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers. Tertiary consumers can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous.
