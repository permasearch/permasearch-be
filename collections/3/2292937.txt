After two years of inactivity on the title, prompting concerns that the game might have been canceled, Focus Home announced the game again in February 2016, now in development for release in 2017 by studio Cyanide.[6][7][8] They revealed that the game would be a semi-open world investigative RPG with elements of stealth and psychological horror. The game will be built on the Unreal Engine 4 game engine.[7] It will be more closely based on the Call of Cthulhu "pen and paper" RPG than on H. P. Lovecraft's original short story of the same name.[9]
