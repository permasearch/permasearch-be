In narratology and comparative mythology, others have proposed narrative patterns such as psychoanalyst Otto Rank in 1909 and anthropologist Lord Raglan in 1936. Both have lists of different cross-cultural traits often found in the accounts of heroes, including mythical heroes.[42][43] According to Robert Segal, "The theories of Rank, Campbell, and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths."[2]
