As part of a plan to destroy Huan, Sauron took the form of the greatest werewolf in Middle-earth's history. When the plan backfired, he assumed a serpent-like form, and finally changed back "from monster to his own accustomed form".[49] The implication is that his "accustomed form" was not, at least, overtly monstrous. It is understood to have been humanoid.
