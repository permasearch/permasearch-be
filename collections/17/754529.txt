The United States Coast Guard defines a personal watercraft, amongst other criteria, as a jet-drive boat, less than 13 feet (4 m) in length, in order to exclude from that definition more conventional-sized jet-boats.[1] There is a wide variety of "jetboats" many of which exceed 30–40 feet (9–12 m) in length.
