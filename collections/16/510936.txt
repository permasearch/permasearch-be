Livy's book 45 ends with the year 167 BC. At this point the rest of the books of Livy are lost. the mentioned epitome (the Periochae), which gave a very brief summary of all of Livy's books, records that there several unsuccessful campaigns in Hispania by various commanders in 154 BC and that in that year there was the beginning of the consuls being elected slightly earlier and starting their office on 1 January instead of 15 march as customary. This was caused by a rebellion in Hispania. This is a reference to the Second Celtiberian War.[129]
