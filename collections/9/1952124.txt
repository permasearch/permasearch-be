The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire and of the Soviet Union (as the Soviet ruble). Today, apart from Russia, Belarus and Transnistria use currencies with the same name. The ruble was the world's first decimal currency: it was decimalised in 1704 when the ruble became legally equal to 100 kopeks.[1]
