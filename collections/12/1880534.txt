Davenport has several neighborhoods dating back to the 1840s.[43] The original city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets, where Antoine Le Claire had built his house. The city can be divided into five areas: downtown, central, east end, near north and northwest, and west end. Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and others.[44] Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers.[43]
