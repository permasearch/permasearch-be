**The full numbering adjectives in Greek are inflectional for grammatical gender (ie. there is monos [masculine for single/alone], mone [feminine for single/alone] and monon [neuter for single/alone]), grammatical case (ie. nominative, genitive etc.) and grammatical number (singular/plural). The prefixes are produced from the default grammatical type (masculine/nominative/singular).
