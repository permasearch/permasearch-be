The pipeline attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually on pipeline tourism trips.[118] Notable visitors have included Henry Kissinger,[119] Jamie Farr,[119] John Denver,[119] President Gerald Ford,[119] King Olav V of Norway,[120] and Gladys Knight. Knight starred in one of two movies about the pipeline construction, Pipe Dreams. The other film was Joyride, and both were critically panned.[121] Other films, such as On Deadly Ground and 30 Days of Night, refer to the pipeline or use it as a plot device.[122][123]
