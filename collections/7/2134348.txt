where RQ is the respiratory quotient (ratio of volume CO2 produced to volume of O2 consumed),      e  c     {\displaystyle e_{c}}   is 21.13 kilojoules (5.05 kcal), the heat released per litre of oxygen by the oxidation of carbohydrate, and      e  f     {\displaystyle e_{f}}   is 19.62 kilojoules (4.69 kcal), the value for fat. This gives the same result as the Weir formula at RQ = 1 (burning only carbohydrates), and almost the same value at RQ = 0.7 (burning only fat).
