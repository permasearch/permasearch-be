The following scenes "dramatic shots of bullets and blood-dripped flowers flash across the frame." As noted by Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone.[33] Later, Gomez is shown surrounded by flashes of cameras in a garden as background. The video also features several dancers performing interpretive moves,[34] and later "Gomez begins to shed layers of her clothing, at one point wearing just a corset and underwear."[35] Billboard Staff called it "artful",[36] while Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone named it "dramatic".[33] Gabriella Salkin of V went on to call it "intimate and sultry."[34] While some critics praised its simplicity and meaning in contrast with the song's theme.[37][38]
