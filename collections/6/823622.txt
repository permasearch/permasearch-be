Kid Loki joined the Young Avengers in the 2013 relaunch of the series as part of Marvel NOW!.[78] When Wiccan and Hulkling are captured by an interdimensional parasite known as Mother, Loki comes to their aid and rescues them from the prison that they were being held in. They admit that they need help to defeat the creature, but are wary of trusting Loki, knowing who he is. They go to Asgard, and are met with Loki's father.[79] With the help of Ms. America, the team flee to New York City, but are once again met by the parasite, and are captured.[80] They are saved by Kate Bishop and Noh-Var, but are then attacked by citizens of New York, who fall under the control of Mother as the team flies by in Noh-Var's ship. The team flee to Central Park in order to minimize the number of civilians in the area. Once there, Loki tells the group that their only choice to save themselves is to either kill Wiccan, or allow Loki to borrow Wiccan's powers for ten minutes so that he can save them. Seeing no other option, Wiccan agrees, and Loki immediately teleports away, seemingly abandoning the group to face the mob of mind controlled New Yorkers on their own.[81]
