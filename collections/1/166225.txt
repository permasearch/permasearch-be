Under Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed.[20] This guarantee has long been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-Ã -vis the government. States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot, but was not invoked.
