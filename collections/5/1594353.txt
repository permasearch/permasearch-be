In a conversation with a policeman in "Jeeves and the Kid Clementina", Jeeves refers to himself as both a "gentleman's personal gentleman" and a "personal gentleman's gentleman."[3] This means that Jeeves is a valet, not a butler; that is, he serves a man and not a household. However, Bertie Wooster has lent out Jeeves as a butler on several occasions, noting that "if the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them."[4]
