Pumsavana (IAST: puṃsavana, Sanskrit: पुंसवन) is a composite word of Pums + savana. Pums mean "to grind, a man, a human being, a soul or spirit", while savana means "ceremony, rite, oblation, festival".[40] Pumsavana literally means "quickening a being or male", usually translated as "quickening a male fetus, bringing forth a male baby".[41] It is a ritual conducted when the pregnancy begins to show, typically in or after the third month of pregnancy and usually before the fetus starts moving in the womb. The ceremony celebrates the rite of passage of the developing fetus, marking the stage where the baby begins to kick as a milestone in a baby's development.
