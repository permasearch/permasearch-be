In addition to the 1997 M400s and M400As, there have been many instances of manufacturers copying off another maker's luminaires to create their own: For example, the Hubbell RLG400 has a look that closely resembles the Thomas & Betts Model 25, and ARK Lighting has two distinct fixtures that reuse the designs of the M250As and M250A2s (with the first example made to use 400 watt lamps, which the actual M250 series has never been equipped to handle).
