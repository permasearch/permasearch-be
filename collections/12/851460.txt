Borden's wife, Sarah, is driven to suicide by Borden's contradictory personality. In London, Angier debuts the Real Transported Man using Tesla's machine: the machine creates a clone Angier on the other side of the theatre, while the first Angier drops into a tank below the stage and drowns. Borden sneaks backstage and witnesses one of the Angiers drown. He is discovered by Cutter. Unable to explain Angier's death, Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
