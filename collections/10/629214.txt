"Go, Cubs, Go," recorded at the Chicago Recording Company with several of the team members participating in the chorus, first became popular during 1984 when the Cubs won the 1984 National League East Division Championship and subsequently lost in the 1984 National League Championship Series. That season (and for several afterwards) it was the official team song.[2] It was first aired on WGN on Opening Day and played every gameday for the rest of the season.[3] During that season, Goodman lost his sixteen-year battle with leukemia four days before the Cubs clinched the division title.[1][2] In the next three years, 60,000 copies of the song were sold with proceeds going to charity.[7] Some 1984 Cubs players can be heard performing the refrain.[7]
