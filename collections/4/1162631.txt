On Monday, 10 August 1724, there was a match at Penshurst Park (result unknown) which featured the combined parishes of Penshurst, Tonbridge & Wadhurst versus Dartford. This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson, who may have watched it. No details are known but Mr Dawson says it was "a great cricket match". Note that some sources have mistakenly given the venue as "Islington" but contemporary newspapers confirm that it took place at Penshurst Park.[111]
