Virtually all episodes of AFHV are, or have been, in syndication. Each period has aired separately. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by 20th Television, which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of MTM Enterprises, which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.[47] Disney-ABC Domestic Television (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies ABC Productions, distributes all versions of the series.
