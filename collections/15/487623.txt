She was saved by Suryanshi samuday, who want to help her. But she was kidnapped by Dr. Jackal. He offers her to make more powerful than Shaktimaan to revenge the society. He converts her to a superwoman and uses her to destroy Shaktimaan's status with another devil woman Behroopia. Later Sunanda changes heart and surrenders after seeing the reality of Kilvish and Jaikaal.[32]
