Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks; in-universe by Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) in the film Kidnapped by Danger) is Jack's second wife. Jessup is a conservative media personality and the host of political talk-show The Hot-Box and commentator on CNBC. She begins their relationship after a one-night stand during season four, after Jack is convinced that Nancy will never leave her husband. He dates both simultaneously, and later chooses Avery over Nancy after being told by Nancy that Avery is pregnant. Of Swedish descent from Maryland, she attended Choate and Yale University. They attempt to marry during season five, between "Christmas Attack Zone" and "Mrs. Donaghy"; however, due to a language-based mishap, Jack is accidentally married to Liz (the matter is resolved offscreen). Avery gives birth to Jack's daughter during "Double-Edged Sword" in Toronto (making her Canadian-American), and names her Elizabeth Donaghy after Liz Lemon (nicknamed "Liddy" in honor of "Liddy" Dole, G. Gordon Liddy and Jack's martial-arts instructor, Li Di.). In "Everything Sunny All the Time Always", Avery is on a trip described by Jack as "a hot-blondes-in-weird-places initiative" by NBC News in Asia. However, things do not go well; she is detained in North Korea by Kim Jong-il, and forced to participate in the spread of North Korean Propaganda by reporting news of the free world being conquered by North Korea. Despite Jack's attempts to get her back (including getting help from his ex, Condoleezza Rice) she is stranded in Korea and forcibly married to Kim Jong-un. Jack has a hard time dealing with her absence, as well as his intense feelings for her mother, Diana. Avery is rescued from North Korea toward the end of the sixth season ("The Return of Avery Jessup") . Shortly after Avery's return, Jack discovers that Avery has fallen in love with another detained reporter, and the couple spontaneously divorce at the altar while trying to renew their vows in the last episode of season 6.
