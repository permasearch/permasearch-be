In 1997–98, the relegation was avoided on the final day as goals from Martin Foyle, Jan Jansson and Lee Mills secured a 4–0 win over Huddersfield Town, at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City. The next season was another struggle, and John Rudge was controversially sacked in January 1999. He was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who spent big to secure the club's a second consecutive final-day escape. There was no escaping the drop in 1999–2000 however, as they were some thirteen points short of safety. Horton led the club to LDV Vans Trophy success in 2001, beating Brentford in the final at the Millennium Stadium, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Steve Brooker getting the goals. Following this the Valiants lost the services of veterans Tony Naylor and Allen Tankard, and a disappointing 14th-place finish followed in 2001–02. At the end of 2002, Bill Bell called in the administrators, with the club around £1.5 million in debt. Valiant 2001 secured control of the club after a long and drawn-out process as the season neared its close.
