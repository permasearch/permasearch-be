Iron therapy (intravenously or intramuscular) is given when therapy by mouth has failed (not tolerated by the patient), oral absorption is seriously compromised (by illnesses, or when the patient cannot swallow), benefit from oral therapy cannot be expected, or fast improvement is required (for example, prior to elective surgery).[35] Parenteral therapy is more expensive than oral iron preparations and is not suitable during the first trimester of pregnancy.[36]
