The RPO L89 was an L71 fitted with aluminum heads. While this option produced no power advantage, it did reduce engine (and hence, vehicle) weight by roughly 75 pounds (34Â kg). This resulted in superior vehicle weight distribution for improved handling, although the difference in straight line performance was negligible.
