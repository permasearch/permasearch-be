Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830.[49][50] Algerine slave trade and piracy ceased when the French conquered Algiers.[51] The conquest of Algeria by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.[52][unreliable source?] Historian Ben Kiernan wrote on the French conquest of Algeria: "By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830."[53] The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960.[54] French policy was predicated on "civilising" the country.[55] During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers, mostly Kabyles. As a consequence, French government favored the Kabyles.[56] About 80% of Indigenous schools were constructed for Kabyles.
