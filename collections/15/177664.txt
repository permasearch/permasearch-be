In June 2002, Steve Wynn filed for an IPO to help fund the project. Wynn hired Marnell Corrao Associates to design and build the resort. The resort was built at a cost of $2.7 billion, which made it the largest privately funded construction project in the nation. The name of the resort was changed from "Le RÃªve" to "Wynn Las Vegas" on June 23, 2003.
