The initial investigation spanned nearly eight years. Two men initially confessed to the murders and were convicted, but they were released in 2009 for lack of evidence. No new charges have been filed and local media coverage remains ongoing. As of 2016, the Austin Police Department's cold-case unit continues to pursue the identity of an unknown male using DNA found on the youngest of the victims.[1]
