Ouzo can colloquially be referred to as a particularly strong drink, the cause of this being its sugar content.  Sugar delays ethanol absorption in the stomach, and may thus mislead the drinker into thinking that they can drink more as they do not feel tipsy early on.  Then the cumulative effect of ethanol appears and the drinker becomes inebriated rather quickly.   This is why it is generally considered poor form to drink ouzo "dry hammer" ("ξεροσφύρι", xerosfýri, an idiomatic expression that means "drinking alcohol without eating anything") in Greece.  The presence of food, especially fats or oils, in the upper digestive system prolongs the absorption of ethanol and ameliorates alcohol intoxication.
