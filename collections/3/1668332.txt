After the fire that destroyed Get Sporty Cafe, the Harper quads fight over ideas for the new cafe theme. Anne and Tom reject the kids' ideas and announce that they will use an ice-dancing theme since that was always their dream. The only thing stopping them is their missing practice skates. Mae and the quads agree that ice-dancing cafe would be very embarrassing. So, the quads sneak out to the roadhouse where Tom and Anne used to work in order to hide the skates and prevent their parents from ever finding them. The roadhouse turns out to be a hockey-players hangout where ice-dancers are hated and discriminated against. The quads learn all the struggle the parents went through to keep their ice-dancing secret before they were exposed. So, Dawn leads her brothers to stand up for ice-dancers. Dawn takes down four hockey mullets by throwing her brothers at them. The quads realize that they shouldn't have been quick to judge their parents. When the skates get accidentally burned after the fight, Tom and Anne agree to put a theme that combines all the ideas from their kids.
