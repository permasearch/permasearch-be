At nights, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal bringing relief to the people. The rising temperature results in the formation of low pressure troughs in the parts of the state during Aprilâ€“May. These troughs attract winds from the north-west and cyclonic storms and rainfall along with thunderstorms often occurs; these are known in West Bengal as Kalbaisakhi, or Nor'westers, often occur.[2]
