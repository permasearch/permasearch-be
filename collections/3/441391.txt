Cutler was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round with the 11th pick in the draft, acquired from the St. Louis Rams for their 1st and 3rd round picks. Many believed Cutler was chosen by the Broncos due to the lackluster performance in the previous season's AFC Championship Game of Jake Plummer.[14] After the pick by Denver, Cutler said, "We had no warning. I think I knew about 15 seconds before everyone else did."[15] Cutler, as predicted by most, was the third quarterback chosen, after Young (3rd overall) and Leinart (10th). He is the third first-round pick to come from Vanderbilt, preceded by Will Wolford and Bill Wade. On July 27, 2006, Cutler agreed to terms on a six-year $48 million contract, which included $11 million in bonuses.[16]
