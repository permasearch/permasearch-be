Punathil Kunhabdulla (b. 1940) is rightly famous as the author of popular novels like Smarakasilakal (Memorial Stones) and Marunnu (Medicine). Madampu Kunjukuttan (b.1941) has authored a few very powerful novels, including Ashwathamavu and Bhrashtu (Ostracism). Among the younger generation of novelists born after independence, there are many who have proved their mettle and may yet spring surprises in the years to come. N. S. Madhavan (b. 1948), in his short stories as well  as his novels, chooses unfamiliar themes or unfamiliar treatment, as may be seen in Choolaimettile Savangal (The Corpses of Chulaimedu) and Higuita. U. K. Kumaran (b. 1950) is indefatigable in his search for new themes and plots. C. V. Balakrishnan (b. 1952) is the author of Ayussinte Pustakam and T. V. Kochubawa (1955-99) that of Vriddhasadanam (Old Age Home), both eager to explore new areas of experience. Akbar Kakkattil (b. 1954) keeps widening his canvas from time to time. Shihabuddin Poythumkadavu (b. 1963) is a rising novelist and short story writer. Young novelists today are deeply interested in experimentation both in theme and technique, taking long strides in the post modern direction.
