The sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge. Types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners[32] rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses.[33][34][35] Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment.
