The franchise was developed by The Wayans Brothers, who wrote and directed the first two films before leaving the franchise. Their entries were produced by Dimension Films and distributed by two different studios: Miramax Films, as it was originally the studio's genre film label during executive producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein's run and produced the first three films, and The Weinstein Company—the brothers' subsequently formed studio—which produced the rest of the series' release after the Weinsteins departed Miramax and took the Dimension label with them. The franchise had one film in 2013 with Scary Movie 5, which features new characters and Anna Faris or Regina Hall do not appear, but is still in the original film series and timeline.
