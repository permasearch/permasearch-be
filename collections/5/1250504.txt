The show began with an updated version of The Beatles' "Get Back". As the song ends, the curtain rises, revealing Turner on a platform 30' above the stage. The platform lowers as the opening bars for "Steamy Windows" begin to play. The singer quickly transitions into "Typical Male" before she greets the audience, telling them, "I want you to have a good time". This leads into "River Deep â€“ Mountain High" followed by "What You Get Is What You See", where Turner addresses male members of the audience. Turner goes into 'Better Be Good to Me" ending with a sing along with the audience.[15] The song concludes with a dance break featuring "The Ninjas". The performance shows the two dancers fighting with a security guard as the show flows into "Won't Get Fooled Again". Turner returns onstage to perform "Acid Queen". She follows with the performance of her biggest hit "What's Love Got to Do with It?". As the song ends, Turner seeks a call and response from the audience, asking them to say "What's love got to do with it?".[16] "Private Dancer" comes next leading into another dance interlude by The Ninjas. After a costume change, Turner returns onstage to perform "We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)" as Aunty Entity. The show then proceeds to a 30-minute intermission and returns with a video montage set to "I Don't Wanna Fight".
