The use of water fluoridation first began in New Zealand in Hastings in 1954. A Commission of Inquiry was held in 1957 and then its use rapidly expanded in the mid 1960s.[138] New Zealand now has fluoridated water supplied to about half of the total population.[139] Of the six main centers, only Christchurch[140] and Tauranga[141] do not have a fluoridated water supply. Wellington's water supply is mostly fluoridated, but the suburbs of Petone and Korokoro receive a non-fluoridated supply.[142] In 2013, a Hamilton City Council committee voted to remove fluoride from late June 2013.[143] A referendum was held during the council elections in October 2013 with approximately 70% of voters voting for fluoride to be added back into the water supply, and in March 2014, the council voted 9 to 1 to re-introduce fluoride into the supply.[144] In a 2007 referendum about half of voters in the Central Otago, South Otago and the Southland Region did not want fluoridation[145] and voters in the Waitaki District were against water fluoridation for all Wards.[146] Ashburton and Greymouth also voted against fluoridation.[147] In 2014, the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor and the Royal Society of New Zealand published a report on the health effects of water fluoridation.[148]
