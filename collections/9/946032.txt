The success of the series has also lent itself to parody. At the June 2011 NHL Awards in Las Vegas,[160] the Hanson Brothers from the movie Slap Shot appeared in a spoof sketch in which they try to sell the Stanley Cup to Harrison at the Gold & Silver.[161] The show has received 7.7/10 ratings on TV.com and has received 7.4/10 ratings on IMDb.
