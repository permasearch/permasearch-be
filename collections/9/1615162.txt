During the 2018 World Cup qualifiers Bolivia fielded Paraguayan born Nelson David Cabrera (who had also played for Paraguay) in two matches - against Peru on 1 September 2016 (the match was won 2:0 by Bolivia) and against Chile on 6 September 2016 (the match finished in a scoreless draw). Cabrera was subsequently found to be ineligible by FIFA, which resulted in the awarding of 3:0 wins for Bolivia's opponents, affecting the final standings in the table and contributing to Peru's qualification for the World Cup at the expense of Chile.[33]
