In the United States, H. helix is considered weedy or invasive in a number of regions and is on the official noxious weed lists in Oregon and Washington.[43] Like other invasive vines such as kudzu, H. helix can grow to choke out other plants and create "ivy deserts". State- and county-sponsored efforts are encouraging the destruction of ivy in forests of the Pacific Northwest and the Southern United States.[44][45] Its sale or import is banned in Oregon.[46] Ivy can easily escape from cultivated gardens and invade nearby parks, forests and other natural areas.
