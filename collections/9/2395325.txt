In Sanskrit literature in India, the word यवन yawan is derived from this origin. It was used specifically for Greek people till 250BC while Indian kingdoms often traded with Greece. After Alexander's invasion on western borders of India, the word took a new meaning as foreigner or invader. The word यवन yawan meaning 'foreigner' is still in use in languages like Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam.
