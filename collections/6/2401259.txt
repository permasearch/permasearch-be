At Lou's Coffee Shop, Lou serves breakfast to Molly, Gus, and Greta. They discuss the time when Bill Oswalt posed for a newspaper article, and mention he is currently in Saint Paul for a law enforcement conference, and Molly is in charge until he returns. Gus leaves to take Greta to school and Molly gets a call from the Nevada Police Department. They ask her to follow up on a case about three people being murdered on an elevator at a casino by interviewing a witness that called it in: Lester Nygaard.
