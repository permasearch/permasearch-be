Don Myers is the father of Michael Myers and Judith Myers in the novel, as opposed to Peter Myers in the film. In the novelization it does not say that he is the biological father of Laurie Strode since that was not revealed until the Halloween sequel of 1981. During a conversation between his wife Edith and her mother about Michael's psychological problems, she says that Don would like to have Michael examined by a psychiatrist. Sometime after Judith's death, he and his wife move to Indiana as life had become unbearable for them due to the media frenzy and stares they received from the townspeople of Haddonfield, Illinois. Fifteen years later, they continue to make payments on the house because it hasn't been sold.
