After Stalin's death in 1953, forms of an economic "New Course" brought a revival of private house construction.[226] Private construction peaked in 1957â€“1960 in many Eastern Bloc countries and then declined simultaneously along with a steep increase in state and co-operative housing.[226] By 1960, the rate of house-building per head had picked up in all countries in the Eastern Bloc.[226] Between 1950 and 1975, worsening shortages were generally caused by a fall in the proportion of all investment made housing.[227] However, during that period the total number of dwellings increased.[228]
