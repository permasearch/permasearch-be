While in Glenoak, she gets a job as a teacher and falls in love with Hank Hastings, the doctor who almost killed Matt during delivery. The two elope in Eric’s church. Julie becomes pregnant and wants to leave Hank because she feels that he was cheating on her with one of his female patients, which is not true. Julie goes into labor at the Camdens’ house and Hank delivers the child in Eric and Annie’s bedroom. She gives birth to a girl, whom she and Hank name Erica, after Eric and Annie. When Julie and Hank need a babysitter, they take the risk of allowing Mary, who had been quite irresponsible, to babysit. Later, when they cannot get a hold of Mary, they rush back and discover that their place is a mess, the phone is off the hook, a liquor bottle is on the table, and Mary's friends' baby, Mercy, was left with Mary while she was supposed to be babysitting Erica. Julie later wants to leave Hank again when she discovers that he had left his job at the hospital to be the head of a Women’s Clinic without discussing it with her first. Eric locks them in a room at the clinic and tells them that they could not come out until they had worked out their problems. They reconcile and Hank learns that Julie is pregnant again. She gives birth to a baby boy. Both she and Hank attend Lucy’s wedding.
