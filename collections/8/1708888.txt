Solo attracted more controversy in the United States' quarter-final defeat by Sweden. During the penalty shootout she caused an interruption of several minutes when changing her gloves before Sweden's final kick, in an apparent act of gamesmanship. Lisa Dahlkvist was seen to laugh at Solo's antics, before calmly converting the penalty to eliminate the United States.[121] Following the match Solo called her opponents "a bunch of cowards" in reference to their ultra-defensive tactics. The remark was made to Grant Wahl in the raw aftermath of the defeat.[122][123][124] The International Olympic Committee called Solo's comments "disappointing" but said she was unlikely to face formal disciplinary action adding "People are free to say those things. We wouldnâ€™t stop their right to express themselves, within boundaries, obviously."[125] Swedish coach Pia Sundhage was more blunt in her assessment: "I don't give a crap. I'm going to Rio, she's going home"[126] and later said, "I think she was just stressed, and that she did not really mean it." [127] Swedish players, Lotta Schelin, Lisa Dahlkvist and Kosovare Asllani voiced their empathy for Solo chalking her comment up to being caught up in the heat of the moment.[127][128]
