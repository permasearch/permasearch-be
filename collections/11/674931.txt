Humans have a four-chambered heart consisting of the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. The atria are the two upper chambers. The right atrium receives and holds deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, anterior cardiac veins and smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus, which it then sends down to the right ventricle (through the tricuspid valve) which in turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation.  The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the left and right pulmonary veins, which it pumps to the left ventricle  (through the mitral valve) for pumping out through the aorta for systemic circulation.[2][3]
