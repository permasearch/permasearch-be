Daimler AG has been active in the commercial vehicle business in India for decades. In 1954, the first truck specifically for the Indian market was a Mercedes-Benz, after Daimler-Benz granted a license for automobile production to India-based Tata Group. A year prior, Daimler-Benz acquired an equity interest in Tata. In 1970, Daimler-Benz and Tata entered into a licensing agreement, providing a framework for further activities. In addition, Daimler has licensed various products to other Indian manufacturers (e.g. Force Traveller). In 2007, Daimler introduced its heavy-duty truck Mercedes-Benz Actros to the Indian market. This vehicle is used primarily in mining operations.
