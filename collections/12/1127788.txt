Explosive, incendiary, noxious (biological, chemical) and armour piercing ammunition types are "prohibited"[19] for civilians. Expanding ammunition is not only permitted but a legal requirement for deer stalking. Holders of a FAC for the purpose of (game) shooting or deer-stalking are required to have authorisation to acquire and possess expanding ammunition[46] noted on it. The amount of ammunition allowed for purchase and possession is determined by conditions stated on an FAC.
