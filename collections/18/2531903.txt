Since 1520, regular[14] Lutheran services have been held in Copenhagen. Under the reign of Frederick I (1523â€“33), Denmark-Norway remained officially Catholic. Although Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, the most significant being Hans Tausen.[15]
