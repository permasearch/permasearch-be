Islam is the common heritage in the region with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet.[73] Islamic influences are evident in the fundamental values of various inhabitants including cultural traditions, marriage, education, diet, ceremonies and policies with may reflect stark differences in rural villages as compared to urban areas.[74] People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions.[73] Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and caste. However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly in the area of the dowry system. As of 2016, monogamous and polygamous unions remain an acceptable marriage practice.[75] In following ancient culture, marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers.
