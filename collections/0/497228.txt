A midtempo love ballad,[5] "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow" features tender, seductive lyrics.[6] The group incorporated country-influenced pedal steel guitar in the song after a country band had used it at Paradise Recording Studio, where they recorded the song.[7] Gil Griffin of The Washington Post writes that the song is informed by "the sensual moods of Barry White and Isaac Hayes".[8]
