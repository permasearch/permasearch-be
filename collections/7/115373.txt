It can be easily proven that only the Bravais lattices which have 90 degrees between      (    a   1   ,   a   2   ,   a   3    )    {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {a} _{1},\mathbf {a} _{2},\mathbf {a} _{3}\right)}   (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic) have      (    b   1   ,   b   2   ,   b   3    )    {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {b} _{1},\mathbf {b} _{2},\mathbf {b} _{3}\right)}   parallel to their real-space vectors.
