The original audio was lauded by Bartholow, stating the voice acting "[added] dimension to the already-excellent characterizations", and called the music "almost always appropriate and exciting" with its blending of rock and techno music genres.[6] Ingenito was less positive about the voice acting for the remake, but generally praised the music.[7] Chandran generally praised the music, although noting that some of the game's looped themes were repetitive. He also called the voice acting "generally pretty good", despite finding Tatsuya and Maya's inconsistent.[5]
