Ronaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of his generation.[150][151] Due to his ability to score and create goals, he was capable of playing in several offensive positions, on either wing or in a central position.[152][153] Throughout his career, he was deployed as a forward, a winger, although he usually played as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfield role.[153][154] Despite primarily being a creative player, he was an accurate finisher with either foot, both from inside and outside the penalty area, and was also a free-kick and penalty kick specialist.[153][155] Throughout his career, Ronaldinho was praised in particular for his technical skills and creativity; due to his pace, acceleration, agility, balance, ball control, and dribbling ability, he was capable of beating players when undertaking individual runs, often using feints in one on one situations.[153][156][157] Among his repertoire of moves, Ronaldinho was one of the best exponents of the "Elastico", a move he learned by watching videos of one of his idols, the 1970s Brazilian star Rivelino.[158][159]
