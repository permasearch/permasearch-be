The complete spelling of Narmer's name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish (n'r)[1] and a chisel (mr), hence the reading "Narmer" (using the rebus principle). This word is sometimes translated as "raging catfish".[4] However, there is no consensus on this reading. Other translations include ″angry, fighting, fierceful, painful, furious, bad, evil, biting, menacing″, or "stinging catfish".[5][6][7] Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include "catfish" in the name at all,[8][9][10] but these approaches have not been generally accepted.
