Australia's 2011 season began with a shock loss to Manu Samoa in Sydney, (23-32) but they would go on to win that year's Tri-Nations series; a tournament which they had not won in ten years since the 2001. They however failed the following season in their attempt to win the expanded version of the competition in 2012 called The Rugby Championship.
