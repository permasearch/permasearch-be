To impress Lucy, Lee starts training for a 10 kilometre fun run, only to injure himself after only 3 minutes. In an effort to hide the injury from Lucy, he gets himself a secret sports massage from Claudia (Kim Ismay) from Poland, who Lee found from a card in the newsagent's window, only to find out she is actually a prostitute. She then demands £100, only for Lucy to return when Lee is paying her. Later, Lee and Tim discuss Lee's problem, then visit the newsagent, only to find Claudia's card has gone. They visit Hanover Street, which Claudia is rumoured to live on, meet a young prostitute, and ask which house she lives in, she is willing to tell them for £80. Lee asks Tim to lend him the money, only for the police to turn up as Lee is handing over the money. Later, in the station, Daisy arrives, then Lucy (who Daisy told) and throws Lee out of her flat. After they are released, Lee and Tim visit the brothel Claudia works in. Lee and Tim end up naked in bed with Claudia and Lee asks her whether she will cover for him and tell the police everything that happened in the flat, but she refuses because she knows she'll be arrested for being a prostitute. Lucy runs past and spots them in the window and is horrified at the sight of the two of them in bed with Claudia. Later, during the 10k run, Lee thanks Lucy for taking him back, and says "when it comes to running, always keep away from very large Poles", just as he runs straight into a telegraph pole.
