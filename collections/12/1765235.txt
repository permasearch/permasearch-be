The first true written positional numeral system is considered to be the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. This system was established by the 7th century in India,[5] but was not yet in its modern form because the use of the digit zero had not yet been widely accepted. Instead of a zero, a dot was left in the numeral as a placeholder. The first widely acknowledged use of zero was in 876. The original numerals were very similar to the modern ones, even down to the glyphs used to represent digits.[5]
