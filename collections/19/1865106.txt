Games that borrow from the Worms concept include Warmux and Hedgewars (open source, for Linux, Macintosh, Windows), Hogs of War (3D variation featuring pigs, for PlayStation and PC) and Snails for Pocket PC. Other games based on the Worms concept include Liero, Wurmz! and Gusanos, which make use of real-time rather than turn-based gameplay. Another game that follows the same format is Arcanists; focused around a wizard theme, was created by Jagex, best known for their MMORPG RuneScape. Very recently, Neuchatel Ltd. of London, UK released a futuristic version of Worms called Blast Angle. It was developed for the iPhone and iPad.
