Armadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through water[10] which is accomplished via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances, holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.[11]
