A bartender in Nuuk explains that O'Connell left on a ship. To find him, Mitty would need to go on the postal helicopter, and the pilot is drunk. Mitty recognizes the pilot's thumb with the unique ring. After he imagines Cheryl singing "Space Oddity", Mitty gains a new confidence and boards the helicopter despite misgivings. Mitty learns the helicopter cannot land upon the ship. Misunderstanding the pilot, Mitty falls into the ocean rather than jumping into a dinghy boat. He splashes down into ice-cold, shark-infested waters, losing a box of ship-to-shore radio components before being brought aboard.
