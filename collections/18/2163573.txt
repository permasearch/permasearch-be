The United States Navy's VW-4 / WEARECORON FOUR Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Four, "Hurricane Hunters" was the seventh U.S. Navy squadron dedicated to weather reconnaissance. They flew several types of aircraft, but the WC-121N "Willy Victor" was the aircraft most often associated with flying into the "eye of the storm." The squadron operated WC-121s between late 1954 and 1972.[6] VW-4 lost one aircraft and crew in a penetration of Hurricane Janet,[7] and another to severe damage in a storm, but the severely damaged Willy Victor (MH-1) brought her crew home, though it never flew again. During 1973â€“1975, VW-4 operated the turbine-propeller Lockheed WP-3A Orion.
