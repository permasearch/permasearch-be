Porter points out that differentiation is usually costly, depending on the cost drivers of the activities involved. A firm must find forms of differentiation where it has a cost advantage in differentiating. Differentiation is achieved by enhancing the sources of uniqueness. These may be found throughout the value chain, and should be signaled to the buyer. The cost of differentiation can be turned to advantage if the less costly sources are exploited and the cost drivers are controlled. The emphasis must be on getting a sustainable cost advantage in differentiating. Efforts must be made to change the buyer’s criteria by reconfiguring the value chain to be unique in new ways, and by preemptively responding to changing buyer or channel circumstances. Differentiation will nor work if there is too much uniqueness, or uniqueness that the buyers do not value. The buyer’s ability to pay a premium price, the signaling criteria, and the segments important to the buyer must all be understood. Also, there cannot be over reliance on sources of differentiation that competitors can emulate cheaply or quickly.
