When a star runs out of hydrogen to fuse in its core, it begins to collapse until the central temperature rises to 108 K,[4] six times hotter than the sun's core. At this temperature and density, alpha particles can fuse fast enough (the half-life of 5Li is 6978370000000000000♠3.7×10−22 s and that of 8Be is 6983670000000000000♠6.7×10−17 s) to produce significant amounts of carbon and restore thermodynamic equilibrium in the core
