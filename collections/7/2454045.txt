The practice of feeding cattle largely in feedlots has been widely criticized by animal welfare organizations. One concern is that as ruminants, cattle are suited to eating grass, not grain. Consequently, cattle may have issues such as bloating, diarrhea and digestive discomfort.[13] There are also concerns with water contamination from feedlot runoff. It is not only the animals who are concentrated; it is also their waste. Whereas manure is dispersed over a wide area when cattle graze freely and may have some benefits for the soil depending on climate and topography, the density of manure mixed with the soil in a concentrated operation poses potential health risks.[citation needed]
