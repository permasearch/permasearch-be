BV is the most common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age.[5] The percentage of women affected at any given time varies between 5% and 70%.[8] BV is most common in parts of Africa and least common in Asia and Europe.[8] In the United States about 30% of women between the ages of 14 and 49 are affected.[15] Rates vary considerably between ethnic groups within a country.[8] While BV like symptoms have been described for much of recorded history, the first clearly documented case occurred in 1894.[1]
