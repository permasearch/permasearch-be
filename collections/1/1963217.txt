On the third day of the trek, Parrado reached the top of the mountain before the other two. Stretched before him as far as the eye could see were more mountains. In fact, he had just climbed one of the mountains (as high as 4,650 metres (15,260 ft)) which forms the border between Argentina and Chile, meaning the trekkers were still tens of kilometres from the green valleys of Chile. After spying a small "Y" in the distance, Parrado gauged that a way out of the mountains must lie beyond and refused to give up hope. When he and Canessa realized the hike was going to take more time than they had originally planned for, and they were running out of food, they sent Vizintín back to the crash site. Since the return was entirely downhill, it only took him one hour to get back to the fuselage using a makeshift sleigh.
