The noun login comes from the verb (to) log in, and by analogy with the verb to clock in. Computer systems keep a log of users' access to the system. The term "log" comes from the chip log historically used to record distance travelled at sea, and recorded in a ship's log or log book. To sign in connotes the same idea, but based on the analogy of manually signing a log or visitors book.
