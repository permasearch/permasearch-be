Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the twentieth round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was considered a long-shot to make the team roster.[2] After being used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two became one of the most dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history.[2][7][3] Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.[8]
