Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of psychiatric disorders or long term organic brain syndromes, because many of the signs and symptoms of delirium are conditions also present in dementia, depression, and psychosis.[2] Delirium may newly appear on a background of mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, without being due to any of these problems.
