Mt. Juliet was incorporated in 1972 and operates on a "city manager-commission" system.[2] The city has five elected leaders: four commissioners (Ray Justice, James Maness, Art Giles and Brian Abston â€“ one from each of the city's four districts), and a mayor (Ed Hagerty) elected at large and serving as chairperson of the city commission. Elected officials, including the mayor, are not employed full-time by the city. The commission selects and appoints a city manager, who is employed full-time and runs the city's business on a day-to-day basis. All elected city officials serve four-year terms.
