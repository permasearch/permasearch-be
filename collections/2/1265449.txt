L치zaro leaves his wife and child with the priest, in Toledo, and joins the Spanish army in their campaign against the Moors. The ship carrying the soldiers sinks, but before it does, L치zaro drinks as much wine as he can. His body is so full of wine that there is no place for the water to enter him, and by that means he survives under the sea. Threatened by the tuna fish there, L치zaro prays for mercy and is eventually metamorphosized into a tuna himself. Most of the book tells about how L치zaro struggles to find his place in tuna society.
