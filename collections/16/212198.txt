Alice learns of an event in Iracebeth and Mirana's past that caused friction between the two, and she travels back in time again, hoping it will change Iracebeth's ways and cease the Jabberwocky from killing the Hatter's family. The young Mirana steals a tart from her mother and eats it. When confronted by their mother, Mirana lies about eating the tart, and Iracebeth is accused, causing her to run out of the castle in sadness. Alice sees her about to run into a clock, the event that deforms her head and personality. She is able to get the clock out of the way, but fails to change the past as Iracebeth trips and slams her head anyway.
