For Black Ops, Treyarch focused only on this game unlike past practice. However, it had different teams, each working on separate game modes.[46] Treyarch used a motion capture technology similar to the one used in James Cameron's film Avatar, which allows accurate facial expressions, capturing the whole performance of the actor.[47] The studio also consulted special forces veterans from both belligerents of the Cold War: Major John Plaster (US Army-Ret.) who served in the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and former Soviet special forces operative Sonny Puzikas.[48] The latter taught Treyarch how Spetsnaz soldiers would react in combat, such as rolling out of the line of fire. Spetsnaz AIs in the game have been modeled after him, from his tactics and his movements to his face.[49][50] Although having a historical background, the classified aspect of these Cold War black operations allowed the studio to create its own fictional story.[51] The game also allows players to turn down the blood and turn off the profanity.[52]
