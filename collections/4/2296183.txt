Bush was staunchly opposed to euthanasia and supported Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision to file suit against the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which was ultimately decided by the US Supreme Court favoring the Oregon law.[34] However, while he was governor of Texas, Bush had signed a law giving hospitals the authority to remove life support from terminally ill patients against the wishes of spouses or parents, if the doctors deemed it as medically appropriate.[35] This perceived inconsistency in policy became an issue in 2005, when Bush signed controversial legislation forwarded and voted on by only three members of the US Senate to initiate federal intervention in the court battle of Terri Schiavo, a comatose Florida woman who ultimately died.[36]
