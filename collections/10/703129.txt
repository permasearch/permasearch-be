Mayor Ed Austin was elected into office in 1991, beating incumbent mayor Tommy Hazouri. His most lasting contribution is the River City Renaissance program, a $235 million bond issued in 1993 by the city of Jacksonville which funded urban renewal and revamped the city's historic downtown neighborhoods. Austin oversaw the city's purchase and refurbishing of the St. James Building, which would eventually become Jacksonville's city hall. He was mayor at the time Jacksonville was awarded its National Football League franchise, the Jacksonville Jaguars.[43] The NFL awarded Jacksonville an NFL franchise called the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 30, 1993.[44]
