The Department of Justice under Janet Reno acknowledged wrongdoing in U.S. Marshals decisions surrounding a firefight at Ruby Ridge in 1992, where it is alleged that a Deputy U.S. Marshal shot 14-year-old Samuel Weaver in the back. Deputy US Marshals who were involved in a gunfight with Weaver's father, who was wanted on a federal warrant for failure to appear, and another individual.  Deputy United States Marshals dispute this claim.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Billy Deegan was killed during a surveillance operation after identifying himself as a federal agent.  This led to an extended gunfight in which both sides fired several rounds.  Tragically, Samuel Weaver was shot and killed.  His body was taken to a small building for more than a week and an autopsy was unable to determine entry and exit wounds (see Idaho Federal Court Transcripts for clarification of this incident). "Newsweek" described the incident as "one of the most shameful episodes in the history of American law enforcement."[42]
