Years after the Buena Vista releases ended, another series of "Rocky and Bullwinkle" VHS tapes were released, both separately and as a boxed set. These videos included Upsidaisium, The Last Angry Moose, Metal-Munching Mice, Much Mud, and Rue Britannia. However, these were released through Goodtimes Video and were not authorized by Ward Productions. The copies used were from 16 mm Bullwinkle Show prints. Some other companies also released unauthorized editions of Rocky and Bullwinkle, including Nostalgia Family Video which also released all 98 of The Bullwinkle Show package shows via 16 mm Bullwinkle Show prints and Bridgestone Multimedia released eight episodes as Rocky and his Friends using an old broadcast 16 mm print.
