Elemental gold and silver have no known toxic effects or biological use, although gold salts can be toxic to liver and kidney tissue.[3][4] Like copper, silver also has antimicrobial properties. The prolonged use of preparations containing gold or silver can also lead to the accumulation of these metals in body tissue; the results are the irreversible but apparently harmless pigmentation conditions known as chrysiasis and argyria respectively.
