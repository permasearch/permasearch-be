Current FIFA rules block Asian Football Confederation nations from hosting the 2030 World Cup following the selection of Qatar in 2022.[2] Nevertheless, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in suggested in June 2017 that the World Cup be hosted by a Northeast Asian block including both South Korea and North Korea, telling FIFA president Gianni Infantino it would improve relations in the region.[29] Chung Mong-gyu, the head of the Korea Football Association, renewed the offer to the DPR Korea Football Association, the Chinese Football Association and the Japan Football Association at the FIFA Congress in Moscow in June 2018.[30] South Korean president Moon discussed the proposal again with Infantino during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[31]
