In 1960, Harley-Davidson consolidated the Model 165 and Hummer lines into the Super-10, introduced the Topper scooter,[42] and bought fifty percent of Aermacchi's motorcycle division.[42][43]  Importation of Aermacchi's 250 cc horizontal single began the following year.[43][44][45] The bike bore Harley-Davidson badges and was marketed as the Harley-Davidson Sprint.[44][45]  The engine of the Sprint was increased to 350 cc in 1969[43][46] and would remain that size until 1974, when the four-stroke Sprint was discontinued.[46]
