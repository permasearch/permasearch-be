Meteorite lakes, which are also known as crater lakes, are lakes created by catastrophic extraterrestrial impacts by either meteorites or asteroids.[17][19][20] Examples of meteorite lakes are Lonar crater lake, India,[27] Lake Elgygytgyn,[28] and Pingualuit crater lake, Quebec, Canada,[29] As in case of Lake El'gygytgyn and Pingualuit crater lake, meteorite (extraterrestrial impact/ crater) lakes can contain unique and scientifically valuable sedimentary deposits aasociated with long records of paleoclimatic changes.[28][29]
