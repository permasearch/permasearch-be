Several months later, Sebastian rejoins the show, but is unable to return to the trapeze because his injuries from the fall have left him with a useless right arm. A guilt-ridden Holly professes her love for her former rival over the cold, unfeeling Brad.

He cannot accept that she is not in love with him and does not want him.
