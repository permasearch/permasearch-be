It is traditional to consume pomegranates on Rosh Hashana because, with its numerous seeds, it symbolizes fruitfulness.[69] Also, it is said to have 613 seeds, which corresponds with the 613 commandments of the Torah.[70] This particular tradition is referred to in the opening pages of Ursula Dubosarsky's novel Theodora's Gift.[71]
