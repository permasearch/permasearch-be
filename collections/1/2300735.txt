SPMD was proposed first in 1983 by Michel Auguin (University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis) and FranÃ§ois Larbey (Thomson/Sintra) in the OPSILA parallel computer[2] and next in 1984 by Frederica Darema at IBM for highly parallel machines like the RP3 (the IBM Research Parallel Processor Prototype), in an unpublished IBM memo.[3] By the late 1980s, there were many distributed computers with proprietary message passing libraries. The first SPMD standard was PVM. The current de facto standard is MPI.
