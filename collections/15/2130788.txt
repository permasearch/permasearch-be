The former Birmingham Central Library, opened in 1972, was considered to be the largest municipal library in Europe.[255] Six of its collections were designated by the Arts Council England as being "pre-eminent collections of national and international importance", out of only eight collections to be so recognised in local authority libraries nationwide.[256] A new Library of Birmingham in Centenary Square, replacing Central Library, was opened on 3 September 2013. It was designed by the Dutch architects Mecanoo and has been described as "a kind of public forumÂ ... a memorial, a shrine, to the book and to literature".[257] This library faces cuts, due to reduced funding from Central government.[258]
