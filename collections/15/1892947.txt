Strikers used mass pickets and intimidation against strike-breakers, who were also violent towards strikers. The Dublin Metropolitan Police baton charged worker's rallies. A DMP attack on a union rally on O'Connell Street (then officially called Sackville Street) in August 1913, caused the deaths of two workers, James Nolan and John Byrne. Over 300 more were injured.
