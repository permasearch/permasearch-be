In June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (later known as DARPA). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the "AI Group" founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide three million dollars a year until the 70s.[63] DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon's program at CMU and to the Stanford AI Project (founded by John McCarthy in 1963).[64] Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965.[65] These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research (and funding) in academia for many years.[66]
