On 6 April 2013, ICC unveiled the logo of the tournament at a gala event in Dhaka. The overall look of the logo design is primarily inspired by the unique Bangladesh decoration art style. The logo uses the colours of the Bangladeshi flag with splashes of blue representing the country's rivers (also as being the ICC's own colour). The logo is also inspired by the rickshaws.[19] The T is made up of cricket stumps and the '0' in the T20 represents the cricket ball complete with a green seam.[20][21]
