Cinnamaldehyde has been described as a highly cytotoxic material in vitro in cinnamon-flavored refill liquids.[1] Cinnamaldehyde have been identified as cytotoxic at the amount of about 400 times less than those allowed for use by the US Environmental Protection Agency.[9] Some e-liquids containing cinnamaldehyde stimulate TRPA1, which might induce effects on the lung.[19] E-liquids contain possibly toxic aldehydes and reactive oxygen species (ROS).[19] Many flavors are known aldehydes, such as anisaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, and isovaleraldehyde.[19] The effects of aldehyde-containing flavors on pulmonary surfaces are unknown.[19] A 2012 study found butterscotch flavor was highly toxic with one liquid and two others had a low toxicity.[40] A 2014 in vitro study demonstrated that e-cigarette use of a "balsamic" flavor with no nicotine can activate the release of proinflammatory cytokine in lung epithelial cells and keratinocytes.[34] Some additives may be added to reduce the irritation on the pharynx.[84] The long-term toxicity is subject to the additives and contaminants in the e-liquid.[21]
