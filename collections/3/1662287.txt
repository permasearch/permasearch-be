Note: On this episode's first broadcast, the 16:9 widescreen picture seen on Disney Channel HD was mistakenly compressed into the 4:3 center cut picture on Disney Channel's SD feed; the rebroadcast on March 21, 2010 corrected this. This is the first episode broadcast that was taped at Hollywood Center Studios, joining Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life on Deck and Jonas at the lot; the series was shot at NBC Studios in Burbank for the first season. The series' record breaking season premiere was led in by the season finale for Hannah Montana, which topped the week with 7.6 million viewers.[2]
