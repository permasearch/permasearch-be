The channel officially launched on 1 December 2007 although much of the programme makeup and format of the broadcasts remained the same from the trial.[6] This new channel was nationwide and platform neutral, in that it was carried by all providers as a free to air channel. This channel, as recommended by the BBC Trust's Public Value Test, broadcast only for around nine hours a day during prime time and only showed programmes made specifically for HD. The channel would air programmes from across the BBC channels.
