In Monsters, Inc., he is Sulley's arch-rival on the scarefloor, as well as Jeff Fungus' boss. The two jockey for position as the area's top scream collector. He secretly approaches Henry J. Waternoose III, the company's CEO,[citation needed] and offers to build a scream extraction device and use it on kidnapped children in return for solving the city's energy shortage. Waternoose accepted, figuring it would be the solution for the company's good. During the final battle, Randall is thrown through a door by Sulley into the human world and winds up in a house trailer whose inhabitants beat him senseless, believing him to be an alligator. Sulley and Mike destroyed the door to prevent Randall from returning the monster world and foiled his plan getting Mr. Waternoose arrested in the process while Fungus reforms.
