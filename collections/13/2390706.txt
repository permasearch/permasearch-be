There are no standards for materials management that are practiced from company to company. Most companies use ERP systems such as ARA5, SAP, Oracle, BPCS, MAPICS, IFS and other systems to manage materials control. Small companies that do not have or cannot afford ERP systems use a form of spreadsheet application to manage materials. Some other construction projects use barcode and GPS materials management systems like Track'em.[1]
