The Auburnâ€“Georgia football rivalry is a college football rivalry between the Auburn Tigers and Georgia Bulldogs. The two teams first played each other in 1892, and the rivalry has been renewed annually since 1919 for a total of 122 games as of 2017. Because it is the oldest rivalry still contested between teams in the Deep South, the series is referred to by both schools as the "Deep South's Oldest Rivalry".[1][2][3]
