After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday morning in 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a stomachache. After the stomachache worsened, he went to the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed.[2][41] After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer.[2] Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix.[2] After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy.[42] By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show.[43] Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy.[2] Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority."[2] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.[2]
