Initially, the Frontier was considered a compact, but beginning with the totally redesigned model year 2005 Frontier (introduced at the 2004 North American International Auto Show), it became more mid-sized (as did rival Toyota Tacoma for this model year). It uses the new Nissan F-Alpha platform and exterior body styling resembles that of the company's full-size Nissan Titan truck. In 2012 production was shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Canton, Mississippi.
