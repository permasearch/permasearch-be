New World's affiliation agreement with Fox prompted CBS—then in a distant third place among the major broadcast networks, with a programming lineup that skewed towards an older audience not typically sought by advertisers—to attempt to lure WEWS to replace channel 8 as the network's Cleveland outlet[12] (CBS also sought to replace fellow New World station WJBK-TV in Detroit with WEWS sister station WXYZ-TV, which spurred ABC to buy WTVG in Toledo and WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan from SJL Broadcast Management [later Montecito Broadcast Group, now SJL Broadcasting and once again controlled by the principals of Lilly Broadcasting] as a contingency plan in case CBS was successful in convincing Scripps to switch the network affiliation of WXYZ). On June 16, 1994, ABC and Scripps-Howard Broadcasting signed a long-term deal with ABC that would keep WEWS and WXYZ as the network's Cleveland and Detroit outlets through at least 2005. As a condition of that agreement, four other Scripps-owned television stations—WFTS-TV in Tampa-St. Petersburg, WCPO-TV in Cincinnati, KNXV-TV in Phoenix and WMAR-TV in Baltimore—also agreed to switch their affiliations to ABC.[13][14] In Cleveland, CBS would reach an agreement with Malrite Communications to move its programming to Fox charter affiliate WOIO (channel 19), which joined the network on September 3, 1994, when WJW concurrently switched to Fox.
