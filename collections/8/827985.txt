Reports published by the DfES showed that although there are around 70% of 16 year olds who remain in full-time education, this declines to less than 50% by the time they reach 18, with the majority finding unskilled employment and even fewer going into employment where their training has relevance. There is also a small increase in those who become unemployed by the time they reach 18, which the government hoped to reduce with the act.[26] It is these cases of unemployment which the government believes to be the toughest, whom it classifies as NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training). In 2006 an additional 7% of 16 year olds fell into this category and the proportion rose to 13% among 18 year olds.[26] In practice, only 1% of young people are classified as NEET during their time aged 16â€“18, due to churn between training, employment and NEET classification.[34] In 2015 the percentage of 16-18 classified as NEET fell to 7.5%, the lowest figure since 2000.[35]
