In 2008, Ford offered Mountune Performance options for Fiesta ST vehicles, available at specialist British Ford dealers beginning in March 2008. These were developed by Roush Technologies Ltd, which owns the Mountune Racing motorsport brand. The Mountune Performance Stage 1 (£1,435) includes a high flow catalyst and tubular manifold, and re-calibration of the engine to produce 165 PS (121 kW; 163 bhp). The Mountune Performance Stage 2 package (£1,838) adds new camshafts and valve springs to the basic package to deliver 185 PS (136 kW; 182 bhp).[33]
