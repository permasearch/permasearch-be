Walden hires Michael Bolton to help him propose to Zoey on her birthday, but she rejects the proposal and ends up leaving him, saying she has met someone else. After a night of binge drinking, Walden has some of Berta's pot brownies and picks up a woman (Brit Morgan) from Pavlov's later that night. However, while having sex, Walden begins hallucinating about Zoey, his ex-wife Bridget, his mom Robin, and Michael Bolton, and drives his date away. Meanwhile, Jake adjusts to life in the military, sporting a shaved head, and Alan is on edge because any permanent relationship between Walden and Zoey will lead to his eviction from the house and inevitable homelessness.
