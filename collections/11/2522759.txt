By June of 2 BC, nine months later, the human conception period,[92] Jupiter had continued moving in its orbit around the sun and appeared in close conjunction with Venus[91] in June of 2 BC.[93] In Hebrew Jupiter is called "Sedeq", meaning "righteousness", a term also used for the Messiah, and suggested that because the planet Venus represents love and fertility, so Chester had suggested astrologers would have viewed the close conjunction of Jupiter and Venus as indicating a coming new king of Israel, and Herod would have taken them seriously.[86] Astronomer Dave Reneke independently found the June 2 BC planetary conjunction, and noted it would have appeared as a "bright beacon of light".[94]
