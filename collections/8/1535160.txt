On June 17, in the Battle of Bunker Hill, British forces under General Howe took the Charlestown peninsula.[28] The British succeeded in their tactical objective of taking the high ground on the Charlestown peninsula, but they suffered significant losses. With some 1,000 men killed or wounded, including 92 officers killed, the British losses were so heavy that there were no further direct attacks on American forces.[29] The Americans, while losing the battle, had again stood against the British regulars with some success, as they had successfully repelled two assaults on Breed's Hill during the engagement.[30] From this point, the siege essentially became a stalemate.
