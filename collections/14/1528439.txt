The bust of Nefertiti is believed to have been crafted about 1345Â BC by the sculptor Thutmose.[8][12] The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the 'house altar'.[13]
