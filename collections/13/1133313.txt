A study of the people of the Pacific island Tikopia in 1929 found that the eldest son must marry and receive more land, while the younger sons remain bachelors, emigrate or even die.[80] However, by 1952 many of the customs were being abandoned and marriage was beginning to become universal.[81] In the succession to chieftainship, the traditional custom of male primogeniture continued though.[82]
