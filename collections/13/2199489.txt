In Tamil culture, it is called a tannumai.[2] The earliest mention of the mridangam in Tamil literature is found perhaps in the Sangam literature where the instrument is known as 'tannumai'. In later works like the Silappadikaram also we find detailed references to it as in the Natyasastra.[3] During the Sangam period, it was one of the principal percussion instruments to sound the beginning of war along with murasu (முரசு), tudi (துடி) and parai (பறை) because it was believed that its holy sound will deflect enemy arrows and protect the King.[4] During the post-Sangam period, as mentioned in the epic Silappadikaram (சிலப்பதிகாரம்), it formed a part of the antarakoṭṭu (அந்தரக்கொட்டு)[5][6] - a musical ensemble at the beginning of dramatic performances that would later develop into Bharathanatyam.[7] The player of this instrument held the title tannumai aruntozhil mutalvan (தண்ணுமை அருந்தொழில் முதல்வன்).[8]
