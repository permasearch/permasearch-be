According to Professor Russell A. Peck of the University of Rochester, the earliest pantomime productions in the US were Cinderella pantomime productions in New York in March 1808, New York again in August 1808, Philadelphia in 1824, and Baltimore in 1839.[59] A production at Olympic Theatre in New York of Humpty Dumpty ran for at least 943 performances between 1868 and 1873,[60] (one source says 1,200 performances),[4] becoming the longest-running pantomime in history.[4]
