In 1979, the AORN approved a resolution to promote consumer education and enhance public knowledge of perioperative nurse.[4] November 14 was designated as OR Nurse Day, later it expanded to a week. Since 1979 individual members, AORN chapters, hospitals, and other medical facilities have organized special events and utilized other forms of publicity to help educate the public about the diverse roles performed by perioperative registered nurses.[4] In 2000, OR Nurse Week was re-named to Perioperative Nurse Week to broaden the term. It always occurs in the second week of November.
