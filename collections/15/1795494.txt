Voldemort: Origins of the Heir is an unofficial fan-made prequel to the Harry Potter film series. The series was created by Gianmaria Pezzato and Stefano Prestia and financed through a crowdfunding campaign. A litigation with Warner Bros. ended the crowdfunding because of copyright violations. When a settlement was reached, the film became a non-profit project, but a fan-based professional video.
