In rural Texas, struggling robotics inventor Cade Yeager and his friend Lucas Flannery purchase an old semi-truck in the hope of stripping it down and selling the parts to get Cade's daughter Tessa into college. Cade discovers that the truck is an injured Optimus Prime, and it is not long before Lockdown and Cemetery Wind operatives led by agent James Savoy storm into the Yeagers' farm and threaten them. Optimus comes out of hiding to fend off the operatives while Cade, Tessa, and Lucas are rescued by Tessa's boyfriend, Shane Dyson, an Irish rally racer. They lose the operatives in a lengthy chase in Paris, Texas, but Lucas is killed by Lockdown's grenade during their escape. Using a drone he took during the raid, Cade discovers that the operatives and KSI are working together. Optimus rallies the remaining Autobots – Bumblebee, Hound, Drift and Crosshairs – and travels with their new human allies to infiltrate KSI headquarters in Chicago. There, Cade, Shane and Bumblebee discover the firm's reverse engineering of Transformer technology. Upon discovering that Ratchet has been slain and his head is being melted down, Bumblebee and Drift rescue Cade of the Attinger´s interrogation, Optimus, Crosshairs and Hound storm into the headquarters to destroy the laboratory and rescue Brains, but Joshua convinces them that their actions are futile and they are no longer relevant to this planet.
