The "Camry" nameplate originated on a four-door sedan approximate to the Toyota Celica called the Celica Camry. Toyota designated this initial application of the Camry name as the A40/A50 series. Celica Camry made its sales debut in January 1980[5] at Toyota Corolla Store retail dealerships in Japan.[6] Production had earlier commenced in December 1979 at the Tsutsumi plant at Toyota, Aichi.[7] Despite the marketing position, Celica Camry shares few components with its namesakeâ€”but rather the Carina (A40/A50).[8] Toyota modified the Carina by elongating its front-end and incorporating styling cues such as the T-bar grille motif that resembled the Celica XX/Supra (A40). Strictly speaking, Celica Camry is not the first generation of Camry, but rather its predecessor.
