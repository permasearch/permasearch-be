Many governments say they are introducing IPSAS because it is considered to be good practice. However, very few governments have actually adopted the standards. In terms of the Cash Basis IPSAS not a single country in the world has actually adopted the standard. The main problem is the key requirement to produce consolidated financial statements for all controlled entities. Consolidating government business entities with ministries and departments would be very time consuming and almost all governments consider that it is not worth the very real costs.
