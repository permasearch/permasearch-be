In June 1948 a leg of Margaret Truman's piano crashed through the floor in her second floor sitting room and through the ceiling of the Family Dining Room below. Investigators found the floor boards to have rotted, the main floor beam was split completely through, and the ceiling below had dropped 18 inches. The investigators determined that the west end of the Second Floor was sinking. The First Family was relocated from the west to the east end of the floor.[15] Steel bracing was added to support the Second Floor and ceilings throughout the residence. The investigation concluded that the problem was in fact a collapsing building, not just a floor, and "heroic remedies" would be required.[16]
