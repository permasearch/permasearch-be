When General Nayzor resurrected the Duke Org Zen-Aku, Zen-Aku possessed the animal crystals to three Wildzords thought to have been destroyed. These zords had been corrupted to serve Zen-Aku as the Dark Wildzords. Once Merrick Baliton, the Lunar Wolf Ranger, broke the curse of the Wolf Mask, these Wildzords joined the Wild Force Rangers. They are all piloted by Merrick and had been piloted by Zen-Aku when Merrick was a part of him.
