While the camera is still 8 megapixels in resolution with the image capture size of 3264 Ã— 2448 (4:3), the lens has a larger aperture (f/2.2) and larger sized pixels in its image sensor than previous iPhone models. The flashlight has dual "True Tone" flashes, consisting of an amber LED and a white LED, which are variably used based on the color temperature of the photo to improve color balancing. The camera also includes automatic image stabilization, dynamic tone mapping, 10 fps burst mode, "best shot" mode and slow motion video at 120 fps.[55]
