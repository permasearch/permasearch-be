Records show that Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782â€“83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests.[79] No such export ban happened in the 1840s.[80]
