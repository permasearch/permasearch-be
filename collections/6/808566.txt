(Hardy however never defined or used the notation     ≺   ≺   {\displaystyle \prec \!\!\prec }  , nor     ≪   {\displaystyle \ll }  , as it has been sometimes reported). It should also be noted that Hardy introduces the symbols     ≼   {\displaystyle \preccurlyeq }   and     ≺   {\displaystyle \prec }   (as well as some other symbols) in his 1910 tract "Orders of Infinity", and makes use of it only in three papers (1910–1913). In his nearly 400 remaining papers and books he consistently uses the Landau symbols O and o.
