A financial centre is a location that is home to a cluster of nationally or internationally significant financial services providers such as banks, investment managers, hedge-funds or stock exchanges.[4]:1 A prominent financial centre can be described as an international financial centre (IFC) or a global financial centre and is often also a global city. Regional and national financial centres interact with these leading centres and may act as business feeders or provide local access to them. An offshore financial centre (OFC) is typically a smaller, lower-tax, more lightly regulated jurisdiction that primarily serves non-residents.[note 1]
