Bannon's political and economic views have been described by others as nationalist,[227] right-wing populist,[228] and paleoconservative.[229] He self-identifies as a conservative.[106][230][231] He rejects allegations that he is a white nationalist,[53] calling white nationalists "losers", a "fringe element", and a "collection of clowns",[47] and describing white supremacist Richard Spencer as a "self promoting freak" and a "goober".[232] In 2018, Bannon said at a speech for the right-wing French National Front Party "Let them call you racists...let them call you xenophobes...let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honor."[233] Trump has previously referred to Bannon as "more of a libertarian than anything else",[234] although at least one libertarian commentator has disputed this claim.[235]
