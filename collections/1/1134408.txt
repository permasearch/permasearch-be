Artiodactyls include deer, antelope, cattle, pigs, camels, and related species, as well as whales and dolphins.[46] A small form of the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) is known from Cozumel. The white-lipped peccary has also been reported, but probably in error.[42] The latter has been introduced to Cuba, but is no longer extant there.[47] The collared peccary is also known from Trinidad.[48] The red brocket, a widespread South American deer, also occurs on Trinidad and Tobago.[48] The Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium), a dwarf subspecies of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), occurs on the Florida Keys.
