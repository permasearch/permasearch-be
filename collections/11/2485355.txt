The Chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), and delivered an estimated energy of 10 billion Hiroshima A-bombs (about     1 ×  e  23     {\displaystyle 1\times e^{23}}   Joules, or 100,000 EJ).[21] By contrast, the most powerful man-made explosive device ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, had an energy of only 210 petajoules (    2.10 ×  e  17     {\displaystyle 2.10\times e^{17}}   joules, the yield of 50 megatons of TNT).[22] The object dug a hole 100 kilometres (62 mi) wide and 30 kilometres (19 mi) deep, leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by 600 metres (2,000 ft) of sediment in the 21st century.[21]
