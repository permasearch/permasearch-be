Alfred, the cantankerous hot-water bottle, is a character from Johnson and Friends, a popular Australian children's television series from the 1990s. This character has gained a cult following in recent years, particularly among those who grew up with the series, due to the odd character choice. Alfred is believed to be the only anthropomorphised hot-water bottle in existence.[citation needed]
