After leaving downtown Everett and the US 2/SR 529 Spur interchange, I-5 goes north across the Snohomish River and curves northeast to an interchange with SR 529. North of the interchange, the freeway enters Marysville and intersects SR 528. The highway passes the Tulalip Resort Casino at Quil Ceda, commonly known as the Quil Ceda Creek Casino, the Marysville Water Tower, Quil Ceda Village, the Tulalip Resort Casino and Tulalip Hotel, and Lakewood Crossing before intersecting SR 531 and leaving Marysville. From the Marysville City limits, I-5 passes Smokey Point and goes northwest to Island Crossing, where the highway intersects SR 530, which connects the freeway to Arlington, Darrington, and Rockport.
