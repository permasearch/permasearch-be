Roadrunners inhabit the deserts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. They live in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland, widely dispersed in dry open country with scattered brush. They are non-migratory, staying in their breeding area year-round.[10] The greater roadrunner is not currently considered threatened in the US, but is habitat-limited.[11]
