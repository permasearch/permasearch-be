Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school (e.g., Powell & Lyle, 1997, now to the most integrated setting from LRE)[25] and educational reform initiatives in the US[26] and other parts of the world. Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability, is a common theme in educational reform for decades,[27] and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006). Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades, though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings (Stainback & Stainback, 1989),[28] studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators (e.g., Jorgensen & Tashie, 2000),[29] self-contained to general education reversal of 90% (Fried & Jorgensen, 1998),[30] among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US.
