A prevailing design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was to simultaneously appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while reaching out to new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before.[62] As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority.[63] To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, with a focus on implementing standard features of the genre first.[61] The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch.[60] Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series.[46][64] Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.[65]
