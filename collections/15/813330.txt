In October 2009, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) began a relocation project for the northbound ramp of exit 275, which includes a connecting ramp with I-275. This project was designed to prevent weaving in the vicinity of I-275 and SR 56, a hazard that has occurred since the exit 275 and SR 56 were built across I-75 in 2003. Completion was expected to take place in early 2012.[21] This has been completed.[22]
