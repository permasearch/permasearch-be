When she is alone in the room, Colette paints over a model head, but goes too far and flees. This action sets off a series of miscues: Yumeko faints after seeing what she thinks is a real head in a box, Subaru tries to give Yumeko mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while reluctant to do so with a 3D woman, the President spots the two and thinks they are making out, and finally Mizuki gets help from a teacher before Colette confesses to what really happened. One day, the Art Club is assigned to clean the school's pool. The President suggests painting a picture on the pool surface before rinsing it away. After taking a photo of their work, the club discovers that the President accidentally bought oil-based paint that does not wash off.
