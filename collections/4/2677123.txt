The term "bow echo" was first used by Dr. Theodore Fujita in his May 1978 paper "Manual of Downburst Identification for Project NIMROD."[1] In 2004, research was done to better anticipate the formation of bow echoes, specifically the formation of bow echoes from weakly organized squall lines and supercells. Researchers determined that bow echoes were most likely to occur in weakly organized cells.[2] A Midwest Bow Echo Workshop was held in 2007, at which meteorologists gathered to share their research to better understand bow echoes.[3]
