Given their importance in the cell, the synthesis and degradation of nucleoside triphosphates is under tight control.[6] This section focuses on nucleoside triphosphate metabolism in humans, but the process is fairly conserved among species.[18] Nucleoside triphosphates cannot be absorbed well, so all nucleoside triphosphates are typically made de novo.[19] The synthesis of ATP and GTP (purines) differs from the synthesis of CTP, TTP, and UTP (pyrimidines). Both purine and pyrimidine synthesis use phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a starting molecule.[20]
