Without any major allies,[225] the manpower shortage became critical when France and Spain entered the war, forcing a major diversion of military resources from the Americas.[228][229] Recruiting adequate numbers of Loyalist militia in America proved difficult due to high Patriot activity.[488] To bolster numbers, the British promised freedom and grants of land to slaves who fought for them.[489] Approximately 25,000 Loyalists fought for the British throughout the war,[26] and provided some of the best troops in the British service;[490] the British Legion, a mixed regiment of 250 dragoons and 200 infantry[491] commanded by Banastre Tarleton, gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies, especially in the South.[492][493][494]
