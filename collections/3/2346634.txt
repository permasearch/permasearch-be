The band recorded its debut album at Shangri-La Studios in Los Angeles in early 2010, and scheduled its release through Mascot Records in Europe and J&R Adventures in North America for September.[8] Speaking about the album, Hughes described it as "a big British rock statement", comparing the band's sound to that of his previous groups Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, as well as Led Zeppelin.[6] "One Last Soul" was the first song to be released from the album, receiving its worldwide radio debut on Planet Rock (a radio station on which Bonamassa produced his own show) on August 2.[9] The track was later released as a free digital download on the band's official website on August 10.[10] Shortly before the release of the album, Planet Rock also broadcast an hour-long documentary featuring exclusive interviews with the band and a selection of tracks from the album.[11]
