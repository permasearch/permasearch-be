Justified (originally titled Lawman) was given a 13-episode order by FX on July 28, 2009,[10] and premiered on March 16, 2010.[2] FX renewed the show for a second season, which premiered on February 9, 2011.[11] A third season of 13 episodes was announced on March 29, 2011,[12] and premiered January 17, 2012. A fourth season of 13 episodes was announced on March 6, 2012, and premiered January 8, 2013.[13] The show was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on January 7, 2014.[14] On January 14, 2014, the series was renewed for a sixth and final season,[15] which premiered on January 20, 2015.[16] The decision to end the show was primarily based on lead actor Timothy Olyphant and series developer Graham Yost. FX network president John Landgraf said that, "They [Yost and Olyphant] felt that the arc of the show and what they had to say would be best served by six seasons instead of seven. Regretfully, I accepted their decision." Yost's comments were "Our biggest concern is running out of story and repeating ourselves. This was a long conversation. There were financial incentives to keep going, but it really felt, in terms of story, that six years felt about right."[17]
