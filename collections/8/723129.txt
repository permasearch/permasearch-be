Eric Tramer (Josh Hoffman) is Jessie’s stepbrother from New York (in the 2-part season 3 episode "The Wicked Step-Brother"). At first excited to have a new stepbrother, Jessie quickly grows to dislike his rough, confrontational and offensive personality. Eric causes trouble and conflict at Bayside, particularly with Zack who feels threatened by the new prankster bad-boy, even going so far as to offer up Mr. Belding’s car for auto shop class dissection to get Zack into trouble. However, after a punch and a speech from Jessie (after he said she was "just a chick"), he reforms his ways, entirely reassembles Belding’s car, and apologizes to all. He was planning to return to NYC, but the gang, particularly Lisa, who had developed feelings for him, convinces him to remain at Bayside.
