Given any subset S of a group G, the subgroup generated by S consists of products of elements of S and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of G containing S.[31] In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r2 and fv consists of these two elements, the identity element id and fh = fv â€¢ r2. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.
