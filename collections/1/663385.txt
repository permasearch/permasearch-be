Chevrolet has discussed re-introducing the Colorado 7 as the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, which is already on sale in other markets globally, but it will not be sold in North America. GM claims that the sales of the Equinox and Traverse would dwindle. However, on November 16, 2015, it did file trademark applications for the Blazer and Chevrolet Blazer in the United States, which could open the door for a next generation successor to the TrailBlazer.[21] On August 22, 2017, spy shot photos confirmed that Chevrolet will use the Blazer nameplate for a midsize crossover SUV (slotted between the full size Traverse and compact Equinox), which is slated to debut in 2018 as a 2019 model year entry, thus putting it in competition with the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and a soon to be planned Honda vehicle.[22] On June 21, 2018, Chevrolet unveiled the Blazer as a midsize CUV that was radically different from the Trailblazer for North America. No word on whether the CUV Blazer will be available for sale outside the region.
