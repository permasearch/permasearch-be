The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by stalking and killing the characters, or acting as a psychological threat to the lead character, as is the case in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. Since Lehman's portrayal, the character has been represented by numerous actors and stuntmen, sometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal. In the fifth film, Jason is knocked off the edge of a barn loft and lands on a tractor harrow below, which impales him through the chest. The end of the film reveals that a character shown earlier as a paramedic, Roy, was using the hockey mask and boiler suit to imitate Jason in order to carry out his revenge-driven killing spree. This mask differs from those seen in the previous films, featuring two blue markings instead of three red markings. Kane Hodder is the most well known of the stuntmen to have portrayed Jason Voorhees,[51][52] having played the character in four consecutive films.
