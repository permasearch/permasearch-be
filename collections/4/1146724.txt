The special tells the story of Bardock, a so-called low-level soldier in Frieza's armed forces. At the outset of the story, his youngest son, Kakarot, is born on Planet Vegeta, and is being prepared to be sent to a "frontier planet" (Earth) in order to exterminate all life there. Meanwhile, Bardock and his crew are on an assignment to slaughter the inhabitants of Planet Kanassa, which they easily accomplish by using the planet's full moon to transform into Great Apes. The next morning, after every last Kanassan is seemingly wiped out, Bardock and his crew rest up and celebrate their victory until one surviving warrior catches him off-guard and decides to give him the "gift" of seeing the future, before being destroyed by Bardock. This haunts Bardock with visions of the destruction of Planet Vegeta, and the oppression of the entire Universe at the hands of Frieza.
