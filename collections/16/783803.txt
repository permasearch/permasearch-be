Countries using or considering use of hydraulic fracturing have implemented different regulations, including developing federal and regional legislation, and local zoning limitations.[152][153] In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the precautionary principle as well as the principle of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards.[13][14][154][155] The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the Constitutional Council.[156] Some other countries such as Scotland have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice due to public health concerns and strong public opposition.[157] Countries like the United Kingdom and South Africa have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition.[158][159] Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of wetland areas.[160] In China, regulation on shale gas still faces hurdles, as it has complex interrelations with other regulatory regimes, especially trade.[161] Many states in Australia have either permanently or temporarily banned fracturing for hydrocarbons.[162]
