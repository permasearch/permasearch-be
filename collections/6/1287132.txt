Modern deep frying in the United States began in the 19th century with the growing popularity of cast iron, particularly around the American South which led to the development of many modern deep-fried dishes.[13] Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century,[16] with foods such as onion rings,[17] deep-fried turkey,[18] and corn dogs[19] all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods,[20] especially French fries.
