Meanwhile, the parks employees attend an art show exhibiting paintings that will later be hung in government buildings. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) displays his painting of the fictional topless centaur Greek goddess Diaphena, which looks exactly like Leslie.[2][3] Jerry explains he subconsciously painted Leslie while thinking about powerful women. Instead of being embarrassed, Leslie feels empowered by the painting.  Tom, however, is humiliated because a pot-bellied cherub in the painting shares his likeness. The next day, local conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) compares the painting to bestiality, deems it unsuitable for a government setting and demands it be destroyed.
