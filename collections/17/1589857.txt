After the English took over New Amsterdam in 1664, they changed the name to New York (after the Duke of York) and changed the rules governing slavery in the colony. Some 40 percent of the small population was in bondage.[13] The new slavery rules were more harsh and restrictive than those of the Dutch, and rescinded many of the former rights and protections of slaves – such as the prohibition against random physical punishment. In 1697 Trinity Church gained control of the burial grounds in the city and passed an ordinance excluding Africans from being buried in churchyards. When Trinity took control of the municipal burial ground, now its north graveyard, it barred Africans from interment within the bounds of the city.[13] Through much of the 18th century, the African burying ground was beyond the northern boundary of the city, which was just beyond what is today Chambers Street.
