The surgical process depends upon which organs are being donated. After the surgeons remove the organs, they are transported as quickly as possible to the recipient, for immediate transplantation. Most organs only survive outside the body for a few hours, so recipients in the same region are usually chosen. In the case of a dead donor, after the organs are removed, the body is normally restored to as normal an appearance as possible, so that the family can proceed with funeral rites and either cremation or burial.
