Although the series was set in and around Cape Kennedy, Florida, and Nelson lived at 1020 Palm Drive[2][3] in nearby Cocoa Beach, locales in California were used in place of those in Florida. The exterior of the building where Healey and he had offices was actually the main building at the Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles.[4] "If you look at some of those old [episodes], it's supposed to be shot in Cocoa Beach, but in the background you have mountains â€” the Hollywood Hills," Bill Daily said.[5] In actuality, the home of Major Nelson was filmed at the Warner Ranch, in Burbank (on Blondie Street). Many exteriors were filmed at this facility. Interior filming was done at the Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood.
