The tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by Lost Cause historians and neo-Confederate apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession brought up the tariff issue as a major issue.[144] Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff,[145] and when some did, for instance, Matthew Fontaine Maury[146] and John Lothrop Motley,[147] they were generally writing for a foreign audience.
