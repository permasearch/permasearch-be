On 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.[106] A state funeral was held on 22 January 2008,[107] after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008 most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire.[108] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[109]
