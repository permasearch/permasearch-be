Unlike other hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride is only a weak acid in dilute aqueous solution.[11] This is in part a result of the strength of the hydrogen-fluorine bond, but also of other factors such as the tendency of HF, H 2O, and F− anions to form clusters.[note 1] At high concentrations, HF molecules undergo homoassociation to form polyatomic ions (such as bifluoride, HF− 2) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity.[13] This leads to protonation of very strong acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric when using concentrated hydrofluoric acid solutions.[14] Although hydrofluoric acid is regarded as a weak acid, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass when hydrated.[13]
