Another important finding is a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral[7] cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral hemiparesis in reference to the herniation and contralateral hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus.
