Wombats have been considered as agricultural pests by landholders.[21] Their digging can destroy crops and can increase the risk of livestock breaking their legs by falling though their burrow systems.[22] Competition between livestock, rabbits, and wombats can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which wombats cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and mass starvation.[7][23] The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of wombats.[7]
