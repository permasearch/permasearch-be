Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is a two dimensional fighting game released using the PlayStation Store and Xbox Live Arcade download services. A physical copy of the game was later released as part of Capcom Digital Collection. It is a remake of Super Street Fighter II Turbo (the fifth arcade iteration of the Street Fighter II series) featuring the original game and a high definition version using graphics drawn by UDON Entertainment, and arranged music by OverClocked ReMix members.[1] The game was designed by Backbone Entertainment's David Sirlin to be the sixth definitive version of Street Fighter II,[2] although it is in fact the seventh, being released after Hyper Street Fighter II.
