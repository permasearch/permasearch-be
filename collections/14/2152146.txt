The second Experience album, Axis: Bold as Love, opens with the track "EXP", which utilized microphonic and harmonic feedback in a new, creative fashion.[158] It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix's guitar move through the stereo image, revolving around the listener.[159] The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space.[160] He composed the album's title track and finale around two verses and two choruses, during which he pairs emotions with personas, comparing them to colors.[161] The song's coda features the first recording of stereo phasing.[162][nb 25] Shadwick described the composition as "possibly the most ambitious piece on Axis, the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence" in Hendrix's songwriting.[164] His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion, with tremolo-picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus, which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as "simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played".[165] The track fades out on tremolo-picked thirty-second note double stops.[166]
