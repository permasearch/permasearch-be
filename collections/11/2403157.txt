Davis is a Christian.[92] Growing up, his parents took him to First Baptist Church in Longview, but Davis said it was not until after his difficult 2010 season that he "finally grasped true faith", according to Joshua Cooley.[1] Davis says, "It's not about how hard youâ€™re working to go against the grain. It's just about surrendering every day. Give God the glory no matter what happens. After every at bat after every play, it just keeps me grounded and keeps my faith strong and keeps my head and heart in the right place."[92] He reads the Bible daily.[1]
