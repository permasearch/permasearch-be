Experimental modifications of Moniz's operation were introduced with little delay by Italian medical practitioners.[120] Most notably, in 1937 Amarro Fiamberti, the medical director of a psychiatric institution in Varese,[121] first devised the transorbital procedure whereby the frontal lobes were accessed through the eye sockets.[120] Fiamberti's method was to puncture the thin layer of orbital bone at the top of the socket and then inject alcohol or formalin into the white matter of the frontal lobes through this aperture.[122] Using this method, while sometimes substituting a leucotome for a hypodermic needle, it is estimated that he leucotomised about 100 patients in the period up to the outbreak of World War II.[121] Fiamberti's innovation of Moniz's method would later prove inspirational for Walter Freeman's development of transorbital lobotomy.[122]
