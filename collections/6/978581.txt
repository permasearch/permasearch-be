In 2015 mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera announced the construction[citation needed] of two more stations and a terminal for Line 12: Valentín Campa,[15] Álvaro Obregón and Observatorio, both west of Mixcoac; these are to be built by 2016. With this Line 12 will be connected to Line 1 and provide a new metro access to the Observatorio zone, which will become the terminal for the intercity train between México City and Toluca, planned to complete in 2018.[16][17]
