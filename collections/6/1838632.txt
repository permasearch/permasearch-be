The resulting Dehumanizer was released on 22 June 1992. In the U.S., the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records, as Dio and his namesake band were still under contract to the label at the time. While the album received mixed reviews,[103][106], it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade.[58] Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single "TV Crimes", the album peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200.[27] The album also featured "Time Machine", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film Wayne's World. Additionally, the perception among fans of a return of some semblance of the "real" Sabbath provided the band with much needed momentum.
