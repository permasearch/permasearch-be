Japan's population is aging faster than any other country on the planet.[71] The population of those 65Â years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. Life expectancy for women in Japan is 87 years, five years more than that of the U.S.[72] Men in Japan with a life expectancy of 81 years, have surpassed U.S. life expectancy by four years.[72] The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France.[73] Japan also has more centenarians than any other country (58,820 in 2014, or 42.76 per 100,000 people). Almost one in five of the world's centenarians live in Japan, and 87% of them are women.[74]
