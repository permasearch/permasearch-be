In the meantime, Caroline (Candice Accola) has to drive to a family engagement in the storm and she leaves after she says goodbye to Matt (Zach Roerig). The main roads are closed so she drives in the backwoods when her car gets stuck in the mud. She has no cell reception so she decides to get out trying to get one and call for help. She falls down and grabs a tree root to steady herself only to discover that it is a human arm.
