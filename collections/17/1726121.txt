In 1940, Joseph E. Widener donated more than 2,000 sculptures, paintings, decorative art works, and porcelains to the National Gallery of Art. The paintings included Raphael's Small Cowper Madonna, Bellini's Feast of the gods, eight van Dycks, two Vermeers, fourteen Rembrandts, and a series of portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds.[5] The sculptures included Donatello's "David" and Desiderio da Settignano's "St John the Baptist".[5]
