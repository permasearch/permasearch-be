Also in 1975, Pink Floyd performed at County Stadium. An urban legend has sprung up around this show â€“ according to legend, the dark and brooding clouds parted and revealed a brilliant moon just as the band was launching into the line "I'll see you on the dark side of the moon." Pink Floyd returned to County Stadium in 1977, drawing an estimated 60,000. For a third and final time, the band returned on September 30, 1987, on the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour.
