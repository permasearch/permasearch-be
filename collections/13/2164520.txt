In the United States, hunters must also purchase a federal duck stamp and often a state stamp. It is illegal to shoot ducks from a motor vehicle or a moving boat. Shooting sitting or swimming ducks is considered unsportsmanlike by some and possibly unsafe. Many practices that were once common in commercial duck hunting before the start of the 20th century, including laying baits such as corn, use of live ducks as "decoys," and use of guns larger than a 10-gauge, are now prohibited.[8] In most areas, shotguns that can hold more than three shells must be modified to reduce their magazine size.  A wooden plug is installed in the hollow magazine of the shotgun.  Legal hunting is limited to a set time period (or "season"), which generally extends from fall to early winter, while birds are migrating south.[9]
