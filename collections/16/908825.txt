Service: Lorenzo Lamas, Colin Walker and the band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy were guests in addition to Lou Diamond Phillips, who was a VIP guest. All the tables are served an amuse-bouche of Ahi-tuna. Both kitchens start strong on the appetizers with Sade and Santos serving in a good pace in the blue kitchen and Roe and Sterling right behind them in the red kitchen. However after some time Sterling in the red kitchen serves up a portion of scallops seared on only one side. While Sterling re-fires his scallops, starts the blue team starts sending their first entrees of the night out without any problems except a lack of communication. When Sterling sends up his re-fired scallops and one of them is raw, Ramsay suggests that they change stations, however Sterling is reluctant to get anybody else to work fish as he feels he needs to show he can handle it. This forces Ramsay to pull the entire team inside the pantry where Sterling agrees that if he messes up one more time Roe can take over his station. He brings up another unacceptable tray of scallops and Roe overtakes his station while he takes over garnish from La Tasha. After that, both teams still run smoothly with a couple of mishaps such as Santos in the blue kitchen bringing up a tray of burnt scallops for Lou Diamond Phillips' table and getting a warning in the pantry by Ramsay. Jennifer also gets a little overwhelmed by the amount of meat that are on order, however, both team finishes with no one thrown out.
