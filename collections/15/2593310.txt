Spark to a Flame: The Very Best of Chris de Burgh is the third compilation album by Chris de Burgh, released by A&M Records in 1989. The album was released largely to capitalise on the resurgence of de Burgh's career after the smash hit of The Lady In Red three years earlier. As a result, most of the tracks are drawn from his 1980s albums The Getaway, Man On The Line, Into The Light and Flying Colours.
