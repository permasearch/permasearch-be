The airfield was built in 1942 as Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Martha's Vineyard (NAAF Martha's Vineyard) to support training of naval aviators prior to their deployment to aircraft carriers in the Pacific Theater. Thousands of men received six weeks of intensive training there. The installation was renamed as a 'Naval Auxiliary Air Station Martha's Vineyard in 1945, placed in caretaker status in 1946, and ultimately transferred to Dukes County in 1959.[2]
