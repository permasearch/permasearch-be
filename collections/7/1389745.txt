Cadmium, zinc, magnesium, titanium, and beryllium have a slip plane at {0001} and a slip direction of <1120>. This creates a total of three slip systems, depending on orientation. (Remember that a slip system is a combination of a slip plane and a slip direction) Other combinations are also possible.[3]
