George Lutz maintained that events in the book were "mostly true" and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part.[citation needed] In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a polygraph test relating to their experiences at the house, the results of which, in Mr. Rice's[who?] opinion, did not indicate lying.[16][17] In October 2000, The History Channel broadcast Amityville: The Haunting and Amityville: Horror or Hoax?, a two-part documentary made by horror screenwriter/producer Daniel Farrands to mark the 25th anniversary of the case. George Lutz commented in an interview for the program: "I believe this has stayed alive for 25 years because it's a true story. It doesn't mean that everything that has ever been said about it is true. It's certainly not a hoax. It's real easy to call something a hoax. I wish it was. It's not."
