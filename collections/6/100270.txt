The Deserted Village condemns rural depopulation, the enclosure of common land, the creation of landscape gardens and the pursuit of excessive wealth.[15] In Goldsmith's vision, wealth does not necessarily bring either prosperity or happiness. Indeed, it can be dangerous to the maintenance of British liberties and displaces traditional community.[16] In making this argument, some have regarded Goldsmith not as a political radical, but as a socially-concerned "conservative".[17] Indeed, his emphasis on the corrupting effects of luxury fit closely with discourses associated with Tory writers of the time.[18]
