Baby powder is an astringent powder used for preventing diaper rash, as a deodorant, and for other cosmetic uses. It may be composed of talcum (in which case it is also called talcum powder) or corn starch (in which case it is also called corn starch). Talcum powder is dangerous if inhaled since it may cause aspiration pneumonia or granuloma.[1] Pediatricians generally prefer cornstarch to talc because it is unlikely to be easily inhaled.[citation needed] Baby powder can also be used as a shampoo, cleaning agent, and freshener.[2]
