The Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogs the objects in the Solar System, classifies Sedna as a scattered object.[59] However, this grouping is heavily questioned, and many astronomers have suggested that it, together with a few other objects (e.g. 2000 CR105), be placed in a new category of distant objects named extended scattered disc objects (E-SDO),[60] detached objects,[61] distant detached objects (DDO),[45] or scattered-extended in the formal classification by the Deep Ecliptic Survey.[62]
