At least 40% of the world's electricity comes from coal,[40][48] and in 2016, 30% of the United States' electricity came from coal, down from approximately 49% in 2008.[49][50][51] As of 2012 in the United States, use of coal to generate electricity was declining, as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing of tight shale formations became available at low prices.[50]
