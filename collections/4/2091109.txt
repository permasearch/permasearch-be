The Woodcock–Johnson III NU Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III NU) was developed by Richard W. Woodcock, Kevin S. McGrew and Nancy Mather and published in 2007 by Riverside.[26] Note that the WJ III classification terms are not applied to the same score ranges as for the Wechsler or Stanford–Binet tests.
