The Ganges is also the mother, the Ganga Mata (mata="mother") of Hindu worship and culture, accepting all and forgiving all.[68] Unlike other goddesses, she has no destructive or fearsome aspect, destructive though she might be as a river in nature.[68] She is also a mother to other gods.[72] She accepts Shiva's incandescent seed from the fire-god Agni, which is too hot for this world, and cools it in her waters.[72] This union produces Skanda, or Kartikeya, the god of war.[72] In the Mahabharata, she is the wife of Shantanu, and the mother of heroic warrior-patriarch, Bhishma.[72] When Bhishma is mortally wounded in battle, Ganga comes out of the water in human form and weeps uncontrollably over his body.[72]
