In 2013, the Polish parliament rejected proposed legislation for civil partnerships, which the majority of Polish society is against,[211] but for the first time it gave an asylum to a gay person from Uganda on the basis of the sexual orientation.[212] In a 2013 opinion poll conducted by CBOS, 60% of Poles were against homosexual civil partnerships, 72% were against same-sex marriage, 88% were against adoption by same-sex couples, and 68% were against gays and lesbians publicly showing their way of life.[211] Article 18 of the Constitution of Poland bans same-sex marriage.[213]
