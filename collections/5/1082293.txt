After the Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire and the Roman naval presence at Aden to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants agreed with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the Arabian peninsula[53] to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.[54] However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.[55]
