The Benevolent Empire was part of a 19th-century religious movement in the United States. Various protestant denominations developed missionary organizations in order to Christianize citizens of the United States and the world, and to create a Christian nation. The movement included a commitment to social reform by wealthy and middle-class urbanites.[1]
