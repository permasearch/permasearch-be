Her second romantic partner was Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially wealthy and supported Addams's work at Hull House, and with whom she shared a house.[58] Lilian Faderman, the notable historian, writes that Jane was in love and she addressed Mary as "My Ever Dear", "Darling" and "Dearest One", and conclusively establishes that they shared the intimacy of a married couple. Their couplehood did not end until 1934, when Mary died of pneumonia, after forty years together.[59] It was said that, "Mary Smith became and always remained the highest and clearest note in the music that was Jane Addams' personal life".[60] Together they owned a summer house in Bar Harbor, Maine. When apart, they would write to each other at least once a day â€“ sometimes twice. Addams would write to Smith, "I miss you dreadfully and am yours 'til death".[61] The letters also show that the women saw themselves as a married couple: "There is reason in the habit of married folks keeping together", Addams wrote to Smith.[62]
