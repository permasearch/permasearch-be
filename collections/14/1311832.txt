During the 2002–03 season, the Flames hired Darryl Sutter as the team's head coach, replacing Greg Gilbert, who was fired as the Flames languished in last place in the Western Conference.[51] Sutter also became the team's general manager following the season, and is credited with revitalizing the franchise.[52] Among Sutter's first moves was to acquire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, whom he had previously coached in San Jose, early in the 2003–04 season.[53] Kiprusoff responded by setting a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average at 1.69.[54]
