In 2000, Oâ€™Grady et al. performed a study which examined the illegal sale of tobacco products to underage youth.[21] With the use of a rational mind merchants and clerks weigh out the cost benefits and risk factors which are involved in selling cigarettes to underage youth.[22] Due to the minimal risk of police patrol after 5pm, merchants and clerks felt a diminished sense of risk, therefore allowing them to sell their products illegally to underage youth.[23]
