In 2008, college professor Kerry Laird was ordered by Temple College to remove the quote, "Gott ist tot" (God is Dead), a famous quote from Nietzsche, from his office door. FIRE wrote a letter to the Temple administration hinting at the possibility of legal action[43] and stated, "Please spare Temple College the embarrassment of fighting against the Bill of Rights, by which it is legally and morally bound."[44] Temple has since lifted the ban.
