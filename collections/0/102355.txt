In 2000, the De Beers business model changed[42] because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel,[17][41] as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced De Beers to "avoid the risk of bad publicity" by limiting sales to its own mined products.[44] De Beers' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to 33% in 2013,[45][46] because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition, as well as more transparency and greater liquidity.[47] In November 2011, the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40% stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc, thereby increasing Anglo American's ownership of the company to 85% (the other 15% is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana).[48] The transaction was worth Â£3.2 billion (US$5.1 billion) in cash and ended the Oppenheimer dynasty's 80-year ownership of De Beers.[49][50]
