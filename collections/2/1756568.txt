The song appears twice in the 2015 British gangster film Legend (based on the story of London's Kray twins); once as a 'live' performance in cabaret by Welsh singer Duffy, portraying Timi Yuro, in a nightclub scene, and then again when the original Timi Yuro single version is played over the film's closing credits. Yuro was allegedly a favourite singer of Reggie Kray[4] and was often booked to perform at the Krays' nightclubs when she was touring Europe in the 1960s.
