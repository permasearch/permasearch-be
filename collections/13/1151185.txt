Ray Kroc grew up and spent most of his life in Oak Park. During World War I, he lied about his age and became a Red Cross ambulance driver at the age of 15. In Kroc's Red Cross company, which assembled in Connecticut for training, there was another boy who lied about his age to get in; his name was Walt Disney.[9]  The war, however, ended shortly after he enlisted. During the Great Depression, Kroc worked a variety of jobs selling paper cups, as a real estate agent in Florida, and sometimes playing piano in bands.[10]
