Howard designs a combat robot, M.O.N.T.E. (Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator) for the "Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational", which the guys plan to enter. When Penny arrives at the apartment, Howard begins to flirt with her but pushes it too far, and she furiously lashes out at him with some uncomfortable home truths. Hurt and depressed, Howard returns home and remains in his room, refusing to go to work or meet friends. Leonard persuades Penny to go to Howard's house and apologize. Howard tells Penny about all his failed romances, and she consoles him by saying that he is a good guy at heart and he just tries too hard to get girls. He thereupon tries to kiss Penny, who intercepts him with a punch that breaks his nose. Howard is left happy, feeling he is halfway to 'pity sex'. Meanwhile, the guys' co-worker Barry Kripke, who is also entering the competition, challenges Sheldon and the guys to a one-on-one fight between their robots. Sheldon accepts, but Kripke's robot turns out to be far superior to M.O.N.T.E. and, with engineer Howard indisposed, Barry can easily win. Sheldon refuses to concede defeat, and M.O.N.T.E. is destroyed by Kripke's robot.
