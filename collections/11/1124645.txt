The dependence of the water ionization on temperature and pressure has been investigated thoroughly.[5] The value of pKw decreases as temperature increases from the melting point of ice to a minimum at c. 250 °C, after which it increases up to the critical point of water c. 374 °C. It decreases with increasing pressure.
