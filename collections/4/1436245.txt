The supreme court judgement in the case known as "Babulal Parate vs The State Of Bombay on 28 August 1959"[8] ruled that the Parliament has power to amend / modify substantially the bill sent to it on the recommendation of the president for making law. In this case, the Joint Select Committee of Parliament made its report on 16 July 1956. Some of the clauses of the bill were amended substantially in Parliament and on being passed by both Houses by simple majority subject to Articles 107 (2), 245 and 4 (2), it received the President's assent on 31 August 1956, and became known as the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. This legislation is in line with the Supreme Court verdict in Golaknath case, 1967 which states that parliament can also amend the constitution by normal legislation under Article 245, Article 248 and entry 97 of union list in the seventh schedule. In 1973, this verdict was over ruled or made invalid by the later judgement of Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati case where it is made clear that constitutional amendments are to be enacted under its constituent power only as per procedure given in Article 368 and no other article or provision of the constitution is applicable.[9] However, in the case of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, the bill sent by the President to the state legislature of undivided Andhra Pradesh for expressing its views was rejected by the state legislature.[10] The rejected bill was further substantially modified by the Central Government and President recommended the bill to Parliament for its enactment without getting views again of the state legislature before recommending to the parliament. The substantially modified bill with an amendment motion was passed by simple majority in to law without referring to the Joint Select Committee of Parliament and discussion on the bill in the Parliament. Many petitions were lodged in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 under Article 3.[11]
