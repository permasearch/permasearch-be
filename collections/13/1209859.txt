The band continued touring successfully until the group finally broke up in 1918. According to Dave Peyton, who had been the leader of the Grand Theater Orchestra in 1915, the Original Creole Band had been so popular when the group hit Chicago that they “were bidded for by every theatrical agency in the city.” They were so popular, in fact, that, a few years after the band dissolved, Peyton asserted that “when they hit Broadway they were a great sensation and would be on the road today were it not for dissatisfaction among themselves and the loss of several of their members by death.”[1]
