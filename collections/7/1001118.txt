According to the website Behind the Voice Actors, there are currently 17 different animated versions of Princess Jasmine from various films, television series and video games, with Larking voicing 15 of them.[79] As a member of the Disney Princess franchise, a media franchise targeting young girls, Jasmine's likeness is featured in a wide variety of merchandise, including magazines, books, toys, video games, clothes, stationery and school supplies.[80] In 2013, Jasmine's appearance within Disney Princess marketing was updated, garnering some controversy because the character's appearance appears to have been lightened.[81] The character appears in the film Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, starring in the segment "More Than a Peacock Princess". Having grown weary of her usual princess duties, Jasmine demands more responsibility from the Sultan, who assigns her the position of Royal Assistant Educator at the Royal Academy, a job she actually finds quite difficult due to its rowdy pupils until she learns to exercise patience and perseverance. The character is also challenged with retrieving the Sultan's horse Sahara after he goes missing from the stables in order to save the stable boy's job. In print, Jasmine appears in the manga Kilala Princess among several other Disney Princesses,[82] although they never interact with each other.[83]
