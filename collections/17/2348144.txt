By analogy, the term "Lazy Susan" is sometimes applied to cabinets (especially corner cabinets) whose circular shelves rotate around a vertical axle to allow easy access to a greater area of space. Such corner cabinets cut out a quarter of the circle to permit two "doors" to be mounted at right angles to one another. These are especially common in kitchen cabinets.
