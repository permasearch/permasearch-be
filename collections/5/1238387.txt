The songs and score for La La Land were composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, film director Chazelle's Harvard University classmate, who also worked on his two prior films.[1] The lyrics were written by Pasek and Paul,[2] except for "Start a Fire", which was written by John Legend, Hurwitz, Marius de Vries and Angélique Cinélu. At the 89th Academy Awards, it won the Oscar for Best Original Score, as well as Best Original Song for "City of Stars".
