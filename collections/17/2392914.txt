After the March 1962 coup d'Ã©tat, journalists quickly responded by forming the Burma Press Council to protect press freedom.[14] Within a month however, several journalists were arrested and publications shut down. By 1988, the number of newspapers had decreased from 30 to 8.[14] The media gradually became the monopoly of the military junta under Ne Win.
