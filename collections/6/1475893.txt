Galilei's countryman and fellow lutenist Giacomo Gorzanis had written music based on equal temperament by 1567.[25][26] Gorzanis was not the only lutenist to explore all modes or keys: Francesco Spinacino wrote a "Recercare de tutti li Toni" (Ricercar in all the Tones) as early as 1507.[27] In the 17th century lutenist-composer John Wilson wrote a set of 30 preludes including 24 in all the major/minor keys.[28][29]
