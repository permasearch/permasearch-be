It has been asserted that cross-dominance (in which the dominant eye is on one side and the dominant hand is on the other) is advantageous in sports requiring side-on stances (e.g. baseball, cricket, golf);[16] however, studies within the last 20 years have shown this not to be the case. In a 1998 study of professional baseball players, handâ€“ocular dominance patterns did not show an effect on batting average or ERA.[17] Similarly, in 2005, a South African study found that "cricketers were not more likely to have crossed dominance" than the normal population.[18]
