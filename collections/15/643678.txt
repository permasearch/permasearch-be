Bill McKendree (Richard Karn), an architect that has worked with Mike and Outdoor Man for years, is bidding on the construction of a new Outdoor Man mall store. Bill assumes the bid is a formality, but Ed feels that an attractive young female architect, Alyssa (Jackie Seiden), is more qualified. Mike assumes that Ed only wants to hire Alyssa for her looks, but Vanessa convinces him to view the bids "blindly" and determine who really is best for the job. After a colleague at her job passes away, Vanessa gets that person's job over an equally qualified but "plain" looking candidate, and she questions whether she got the job based on her looks. After Mandy takes all the drawers in their bathroom for herself, Eve hides all of Mandy's makeup, forcing her to go to school without wearing any.
