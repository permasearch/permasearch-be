The next season, the Devils once again slipped below .500 and missed the playoffs.[37] Among the post-season player changes Lamoriello made in the off-season was the signing of two Soviet stars â€“ Viacheslav Fetisov and Sergei Starikov. The Devils drafted Fetisov years earlier in the 1983 Entry Draft, but the Soviet Government did not allow Fetisov, who was a member of the national team, to leave the country.[38] Shortly after, the Devils signed Fetisov's defense partner, Alexei Kasatonov.[39]
