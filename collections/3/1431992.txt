I'm slightly concerned that the section regarding TR's views on race paints a skewed picture of the guy. He's almost portrayed as a nasty, bigoted racist, when he was actually quite progressive for his time. Much of his views that seem despicable now are better understood within the context of his views of evolution, believing that the "negro race" (sorry if that comes off as being offensive) was simply behind the white race, and needed to promote and encourage its most successful members to "catch up." He spoke very often of treating each person on their merits, regardless of color, and was outspoken in his support for Japanese immigrants against discrimination. I've written something I'd like to add to the section, but I fear it might focus too much of the overall article on the issue of race. I also think the "Views on Race" section should be moved farther down the article underneath the "Character and Beliefs section." Any thoughts on that?
