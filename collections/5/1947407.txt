Tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) can serve as an effective but unconventional catalyst for this reaction.[6] It is believed that hydrobromic acid released by TBATB protonates the alcohol rather than the carboxylic acid, making the carboxylate the actual nucleophile. This would be a reversal of the standard esterification mechanism. An example of this method is the acylation 3-phenylpropanol using glacial acetic acid and TBATB. The reaction generates the ester in 15 minutes in a 95% yield without the need to remove water.
