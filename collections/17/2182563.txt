In 1883, Bernard 'Barney' Kroger invested his life savings of $372 (roughly equal to $9,800 as of 2018[update]) to open a grocery store at 66 Pearl Street[10] in downtown Cincinnati. Pearl Street formerly existed between 2nd Street and 3rd Street. The location is now approximately where I-71 passes the Great American Ballpark. In 1884 Kroger opened his second store.[11]
