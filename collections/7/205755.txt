1866 : Oil discovery at Nahorpung,Assam. Not explored. 1882 : Big "Oil Seepage" in Digboi during construction of Dibrugarh-Ledo Railway Line. The first oil production started in India in 1889 near the town of Digboi in the state of Assam. A Small thatched structure was erected and christened "Oil well no.1" or "Discovery".[1] This discovery came on the heels of industrial development. The Assam Railways and Trading Company (ARTC) had recently opened the area for trade by building a railway and later finding oil nearby. The first well was completed in 1890 and in 1893 first refinery started at Margharita, Assam.[2] The Assam Oil Company was established in 1899 to oversee production.  In 1901, Digboi Refinery was commissioned supplanting the earlier refinery at Margharita. At its peak during the Second World War the Digboi oil fields were producing 7,000 barrels per day.[citation needed]. In the year 1909, IBP (Indo Burmah Petroleum) was incorporated in Rangoon to explore oil wells that had been discovered in Burma and Assam.[3]
