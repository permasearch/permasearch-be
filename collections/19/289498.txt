As of 2013[update], almost all of the 1979–2001 "second series" episodes are still in active rotation on a number of PBS stations.[34][35][36] The only exception is the week-long "Conflict" series (episodes #1521–#1525), first aired during the week of November 7–11, 1983. The series/story arc covered the topics of war, bombs, and an arms race, and was created in response to the Invasion of Grenada, and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.[citation needed] The "Conflict" series was last aired on PBS during the week of April 1–5, 1996.[citation needed]
