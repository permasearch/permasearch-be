The Beatles' rooftop concert marked the end of an era for many fans. They did record one more album, Abbey Road, but by September 1969 the Beatles had unofficially disbanded.[15] Several of the rooftop performances, particularly that of "Dig a Pony", showed the Beatles once again in top form, if only temporarily.[16] Fans believed the rooftop concert might have been a try-out for a return to live performances and touring.[17]
