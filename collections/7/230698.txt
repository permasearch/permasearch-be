Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty.[42] What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight.[43] However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.[42]
