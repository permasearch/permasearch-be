State Road 39 begins at the SR 60 and County Road 39 in Hopewell. The road enters the Plant City Limits at Trapnell Road. An overhead sign gantry points to a truck detour as the road approaches State Road 39A (West Alexander Street), and further north, although East Alexander Street continues as a four-lane divided highway toward Jim Johnson Road. Another truck detour sign gantry can be found at the southern terminus of State Road 553 (Park Road). A third "temporary" truck route is signed along Alabama and Wheeler Streets through downtown.[2] At Grant Street, the James L. Redman Parkway becomes South Collins Street, but from there it also shares a concurrency with County Road 574A, until it reaches East Alsobrook Street. Further into the city, SR 39 has a pair of at-grade crossings with the west end of CSX wye between the Yeoman and Plant City Subdivisions at the intersection with Laura Street.
