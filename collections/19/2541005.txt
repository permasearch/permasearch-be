Two systematic reviews looked at chromium supplements as a mean of managing body weight in overweight and obese people. One, limited to chromium picolinate, a popular supplement ingredient, reported a statistically significant -1.1 kg (2.4 lb) weight loss in trials longer than 12 weeks.[85] The other included all chromium compounds and reported a statistically significant -0.50 kg (1.1 lb) weight change.[86] Change in percent body fat did not reach statistical significance. Authors of both reviews considered the clinical relevance of this modest weight loss as uncertain/unreliable.[85][86] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim.[79]
