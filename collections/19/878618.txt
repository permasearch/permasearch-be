Although wild rapeseed oil contains significant amounts of erucic acid,[46] the cultivars used to produce commercial, food-grade canola oil were bred to contain less than 2% erucic acid,[47] an amount deemed not significant as a health risk. To date, no health effects have been associated with dietary consumption of erucic acid by humans; but tests of erucic acid metabolism in other species imply that higher levels may be detrimental.[48][49]:646â€“657 Canola oil produced using genetically modified plants has also not been shown to explicitly produce adverse effects.[50]
