In 2017, Paytm became India's first payment app to cross over 100 million app downloads.[13] The same year, it launched Paytm Gold,[14] a product that allowed users to buy as little as ₹1 of pure gold online. It also launched the Paytm Payments Bank[15][16] and ‘Inbox’, a messaging platform with in-chat payments among other products.[17] By 2018, it started allowing merchants to accept Paytm, UPI and Card payments directly into their bank accounts at 0% charge.[18][19] It also launched the ‘Paytm for Business’ app, allowing merchants to track their payments and day-to-day settlements instantly.[20] This led its merchant base to grow to more than 7 million by March 2018.
