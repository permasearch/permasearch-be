Constantine made some new laws regarding the Jews, but while some of his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors.[232] It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity.[232] They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves.[233][234] On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.[232][235]
