While the company initially profited from domestic sales,[9] it vowed to use money from its 2004 Hong Kong IPO to further expand R&D, overseas sales to developed nations, and overseas production.[10] Making headway in the international telecom market in 2006, it took 40% of new global orders for CDMA networks[11] topping the world CDMA equipment market by number of shipments.[12] That same year also saw ZTE find a customer in the Canadian Telus[13] and membership in the Wi-Fi Alliance.[14] More customers in developed nations soon followed Telus' lead, and in 2007 ZTE had sold to UK's Vodafone, Spain's Telefonica, and the Australian Telstra,[13] as well as garnering the greatest number of CDMA contracts globally.[15] By 2008 ZTE could claim its customer base was truly global, as it had made sales in 140 countries.[13]
