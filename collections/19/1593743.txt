Mr. Wyland was the 3rd grade substitute teacher for Mr. Garrison for two episodes after Mr. Garrison was caught attempting to molest a child (Cartman) in "Cartman Joins NAMBLA". Wyland wears a blue top with a red bow tie. He was first shown in "Cherokee Hair Tampons" and made the class make a get well card for Kyle, who needed a kidney transplant. As a joke, the children make Butters into a get well card by gluing glitter and a sign that says "Get Well Kyle" on him and making him sing a song for Kyle. He was then shown in the next episode, "Chef Goes Nanners", and organized a debate on whether or not to change the South Park Flag, which depicted four white men hanging a black man.
