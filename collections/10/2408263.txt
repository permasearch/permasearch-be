Sophie is doing her driving test when it occurs to her that the bracelet she thought her father sent her was not from him, but from Cap. All the things she said and did to him and all he did was respond in kindness. As soon as she passes her test she drives to Garland, determined to take Cap to the Halloween Bash. Cap has had the same idea and a few miles from the commune they meet each other. Jumping into Sophie's car, they drive to Claverage Middle School.
