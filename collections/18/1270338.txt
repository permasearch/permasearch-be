Some cheeses are categorized by the source of the milk used to produce them or by the added fat content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world's commercially available cheese is made from cow's milk, many parts of the world also produce cheese from goats and sheep. Well-known examples include Roquefort (produced in France) and Pecorino (produced in Italy) from ewe's milk. One farm in Sweden also produces cheese from moose's milk.[6] Sometimes cheeses marketed under the same name are made from milk of different animalâ€”Feta style cheeses, for example, are made from sheep's milk in Greece and from cow's milk elsewhere.
