Holland and Smith wanted Kathy to be attractive, warm, practical, tough, funny and sexy.[1] More actresses were interviewed for the role of Kathy than any other original character. Each actress possessed some of the facets of personality wanted, but not a single one had all of them.[1] Gillian Taylforth was an actress that Smith and Holland had encountered during an open evening they had attended at The Anna Scher Theatre in Islington, North London. They had been drawn to Taylforth because of her voice â€” "husky and adenoidal", which seemed at odds with her feminine appearance, which they described as "stunningly attractive".[1] During the open evening, they considered Taylforth for the role of Sue Osman, but she was dismissed because she was blonde rather than brunette. They briefly considered her for the role of Kathy, but she was again dismissed because she was too young for the role.[1] They instead decided "to bear her in mind for the future".[1]
