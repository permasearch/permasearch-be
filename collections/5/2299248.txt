Not much is known about Erta Ale and the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded.[9] The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack[10] and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012.[11] One travel guide recommends hiring "one or maybe two armed guards or police" as guides to visit Erta Ale.[12] Commercial tour companies offer tours to Erta Ale which are generally accompanied by military escort.
