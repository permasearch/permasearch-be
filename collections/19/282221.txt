Cleavages have emerged within these respective camps of thought, however. Much of the modern scholarly debate surrounding the allegory has emerged from Martin Heidegger's exploration of the allegory, and philosophy as a whole, through the lens of human freedom in his book The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato's Cave Allegory and Theaetetus.[9] In response, Hannah Arendt, an advocate of the political interpretation of the allegory, suggests that through the allegory, Plato “wanted to apply his own theory of ideas to politics”.[10] Conversely, Heidegger argues that the essence of truth is a way of being and not an object.[11] Arendt criticized Heidegger’s interpretation of the allegory, noting that “Heidegger…is off base in using the cave simile to interpret and “criticize” Plato’s theory of ideas”.[10]
