Ponceau S is a negatively charged reversible dye that stains proteins a reddish pink color and is removed easily by washing in water. The intensity of Ponceau S staining decreases quickly over time, so documentation should be conducted rapidly. A linear range of up to 140 Î¼g is reported for Ponceau S with poor reproducibility due to its highly time-dependent staining intensity and low signal-to-noise ratio.[25][26]
