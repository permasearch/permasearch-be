The Crusaders' name was chosen to reflect the crusading nature of Canterbury rugby.[70] A potential name was also the Plainsmen; however, this was not chosen, as "Crusaders" recalled the English heritage of the city of Christchurch.[70] Christchurch was established by English emigrants in the 19th century and is often described as the most English city outside England.[71][72] The club adopted Canterbury's traditional sporting colours of red and black, as worn by Canterbury.
