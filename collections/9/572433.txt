Mining, refining, and recycling of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A potential hazard could be low-level radioactive tailings resulting from the occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare-earth element ores.[81] Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining in order to protect the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South,[82] where mines – commonly small, rural, and illegal operations – are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply.[22][83] However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world's rare-earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage.[84]
