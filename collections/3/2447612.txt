Thomas Cook have replaced their B757-200 aircraft with new Airbus A321s. The cabin is yellow and grey to reflect the new corporate livery. Newer aircraft feature slim design leather seats in a two tone grey design. These seats have a seat pocket in the upper part of the seat in front, which allows for increased legroom.[citation needed]
