The origins of the 4 Ps can be traced to the late 1940s.[8][9] The first known mention of a mix has been attributed to a Professor of Marketing at Harvard University, Prof. James Culliton.[10] In 1948, Culliton published an article entitled, The Management of Marketing Costs[11] in which Culliton describes marketers as 'mixers of ingredients'. Some years later, Culliton's colleague, Professor Neil Borden, published a retrospective article detailing the early history of the marketing mix in which he claims that he was inspired by Culliton's idea of 'mixers', and credits himself with popularising the concept of the 'marketing mix'.[12] According to Borden's account, he used the term, 'marketing mix' consistently from the late 1940s. For instance, he is known to have used the term 'marketing mix' in his presidential address given to the American Marketing Association in 1953.[13]
