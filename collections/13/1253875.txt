On March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach the number three spot on the rhythm and blues charts.[14] That night, Perkins and his band first performed "Blue Suede Shoes" on television, on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee[15] (coincidentally, Presley was on Stage Show on CBS-TV that same night, for which he also performed the song).
