Phaedrus starts by pointing out that Eros is the oldest of the gods, and that Eros promotes virtue in people[19]. Pausanias is next, and he contrasts common desire with a “heavenly” love in the form of pederasty, which occurs between a man and a young boy; and in which the boy gives sexual pleasure, and in return gains knowledge and virtue. Next Eryximachus speaks, and suggests that Eros encourages “sophrosyne”, or soundness of mind and character, and is not only about human behavior, but also occurs in music, medicine, and many other areas of life.
