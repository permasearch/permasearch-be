A sentence of detention in a young offenders' institution (or YOI) is available to the court in respect of those between the ages of 15 and 21 years (inclusive) who have committed imprisonable offences. The relevant provisions are contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1982, which introduced the sentence to replace borstal training. YOI's are managed by the Prison Service.[27] The term of detention is up to the maximum allowed for adult imprisonment for the relevant offence, and the same custody threshold ("so serious") applies as in the case of the adult court. The minimum period of detention is 21 days.
