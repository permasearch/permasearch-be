The origin of the survey can be traced back at least early as the Domesday Book in 1086,[39][40] while some scholars pinpoint the origin of demography to 1663 with the publication of John Graunt's Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality.[41] Social research began most intentionally, however, with the positivist philosophy of science in the 19th century.
