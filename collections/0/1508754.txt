Jet aircraft are unable to land at the airport, because the runway is too short,[6] but smaller STOL[1] airplanes (such as the DHC-6, BN-2, and helicopters) are common sights. A small ramp and terminal are on the southwest flank of the runway. The ramp also has a designated helipad. The terminal building houses offices for Winair, immigration and security, a fire department with one fire truck, and a tower.[7] The tower is an advisory service only and does not provide air traffic control. Aviation fuel is not available on the island of Saba.[citation needed]
