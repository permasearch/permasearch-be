US entry into World War II interrupted dieselization.  The US Navy gained priority for diesel engines, curtailing their availability for railway use.  No production of passenger locomotives was permitted by the War Production Board between September 1942 and February 1945.  The petroleum crisis of 1942-43 made coal-fired steam more attractive, especially near the east coast.  After the peak of the petroleum crisis and as wartime production of diesel engines hit its stride, increasing production of freight diesel locomotives was permitted.  By the war's end, pent-up demand to replace dated and worn-out railway equipment was overwhelming.
