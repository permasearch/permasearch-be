There were plans to pedestrianise of part of the Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat next to the Berlaymont.[61] A new Place Schumanplein (currently the Schuman roundabout) would be one of three new pedestrian squares. Schuman would focus on "policy and politics"[60] and Schuman station itself will be redesigned.[62] Coverings over nearby motorways and railways would be extended to shield them from view.[60] However, the planned pedestrianisation of the Schuman roundabout were cancelled in late 2014.[46]
