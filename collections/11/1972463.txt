Despite this, Scully's tenure as showrunner of The Simpsons has been the subject of criticism from the show's fans.[119] John Ortved wrote "Scully's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays, but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg."[118] The BBC noted "the common consensus is that The Simpsons' golden era ended after season nine",[120] while an op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued The Simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during Scully's years.[121] The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labelled as a "gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation" by Jon BonnÃ© of MSNBC,[122] while some fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf",[123] dubbing him "Jerkass Homer".[122][124][125] Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully and that he thinks the criticism "bothered [Scully], and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it."[126] Ortved noted in his book that it is hard to tell how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single showrunner for lowering the quality of the show "is unfair."[127]
