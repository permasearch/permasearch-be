Following the outbreak of the civil war, many of Somalia's residents left in search of asylum. According to the UNHCR, there were around 975,951 registered refugees from the country in neighboring states as of 2016.[125] Additionally, 1.1 million people were internally displaced persons (IDPs).[126] The majority of the IDPs were Bantus and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions, including those displaced in the north.[127] An estimated 60% of the IDPs were children.[128] Causes of the displacement included armed violence, periodic droughts, and other natural disasters, which, along with diverted aid flows, hindered the IDPs' access to safe shelter and resources.[129][130] IDP settlements were concentrated in south-central Somalia (893,000), followed by the northern Puntland (129,000) and Somaliland (84,000) regions.[128] Additionally, there were around 9,356 registered refugees and 11,157 registered asylum seekers in Somalia.[125] Most of these foreign nationals emigrated from Yemen to northern Somalia after the Houthi insurgency in 2015.[131] However, the majority of emigrants to Somalia consist of Somali expatriates, who have returned to Mogadishu and other urban areas for investment opportunities and to take part in the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process.[132]
