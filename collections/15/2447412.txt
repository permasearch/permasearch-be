George Harley (1829–1896) showed in 1850 that curare (wourali) was effective for the treatment of tetanus and strychnine poisoning.[12][13] In 1857, Claude Bernard (1813–1878) published the results of his experiments in which he demonstrated that the mechanism of action of curare was a result of interference in the conduction of nerve impulses from the motor nerve to the skeletal muscle, and that this interference occurred at the neuromuscular junction.[3][14] From 1887, the Burroughs Wellcome catalogue listed under its 'Tabloids' brand name, tablets of curare at ​1⁄12 grain (price 8 shillings) for use in preparing a solution for hypodermic injection. In 1914, Henry Hallett Dale (1875–1968) described the physiological actions of acetylcholine.[15] After 25 years, he showed that acetylcholine is responsible for neuromuscular transmission, which can be blocked by curare.[16]
