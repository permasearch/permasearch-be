Soon, a Nazi gemologist, Sergeant Major Reinhold von Rumpel, is tasked with evaluating confiscated jewels, and eventually set out on the trail of the Sea of Flames. He has a malignant tumor and becomes ill during his search, which he still continues while he endures treatment and the ravages of the relapse. He finds his way to the Natural History Museum and learns that duplicate gems have been made. He traces each of them, ultimately arriving in Saint-Malo, where the real gemstone is hidden. The legend of immortality that is bestowed by the jewel is something he learns, and although he does not fully believe it, he clings to a hope that it might after all be true and that possession of the real jewel might save him from the growing tumors.
