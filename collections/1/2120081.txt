Haim has been compared to the 1970s soft-rock band Fleetwood Mac, though the group says they are "squeamish" about this comparison and insist they are influenced by more recent music.[65] According to Metro, their music sounds like folk-rock "with a few R&B/hip-hop stylings thrown in for good measure".[66] The group are fans of, and have been influenced by Beyonc√©, covering her song "XO" on BBC Radio 1's "Live Lounge",[39] and described "My Song 5" as "ripping off" Timbaland.[8]
