The San Francisco Mint especially had difficulty with the coins; many pieces struck there are noticeably weak.[50]  In 1918 Morgan, who had succeeded Barber as Engraver after the latter's death the previous year, modified the design, incising some of the details at Liberty's neck.  According to Breen, "The attempt was a failure."[53]  Morgan's successor, John R. Sinnock, made additional attempts in 1937 and 1938, with little better results.  Breen suggested that the difficulties in striking the piece contributed to the willingness to replace it after World War II.[54]
