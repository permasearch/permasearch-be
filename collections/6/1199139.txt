In 1999, Miller released his eighth album, Only God Can Judge Me. It was not as successful as his previous album, though it reached a gold certification. Miller also starred in the movie I Got the Hook Up, with A. J. Johnson, and created the soundtrack of the same name. On November 28, 2000, he released his ninth album, Ghetto Postage, which sold 500,000 copies, but it did not compare to his earlier more successful releases.
