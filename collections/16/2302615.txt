Boyband United Vibe were asked to change their name by Cowell, who criticised their name. Williams even agreed that United Vibe is a "terrible" name and invited fans to pitch them new monikers on Twitter. "I think Simon's right, we need to pick a name for you, 'cause United Vibe is terrible," he added. "Come on Twitter, give us a name, what should these boys be called?"
