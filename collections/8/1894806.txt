In 2005, a large body fitting Rupert's description was discovered beyond Pluto (which was considered a planet then, as opposed to a dwarf planet now). In a poll of the public conducted by New Scientist magazine to search out potential names for the object, "Rupert" ranked #5, and "Persephone" was the top choice.[3] The object was named Eris and designated a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union on 13 September 2006.[4]
