The original casting call described Ben as being in his early to mid 20s,  a “gorgeous, Caucasian, country boy.” He is supposed to be Midwestern or Southern. The casting notice also described Ben as “utterly charming” due to his “honest sincere approach to life and love.” The producers looked for actors with a musical background.[6] According to Soap Central, musical talent was not a requirement for those auditioning for the role. Ben was also said to have a "slight southern accent."[15] Wilson described the character as being "a little more generic in the beginning."[1] "He's kind of a loner. He's traveled and can read people very well." However, Ben can be a bit unpredictable, and according to Wilson, "he's a loose cannon." Ben has a lot of rage because he comes from a "messed-up home." Wilson described Ben as a "good guy" who isn't afraid to "put somebody in line if he has to."[13] Unlike his former role as Pete, "With Ben, I'm playing more of a hungry person." Wilson further described Ben as "very street-smart" and the typical "nice guy." However, he can be a protective of his loved ones.[14] In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Wilson explained that Ben has a "temper" that can get him into trouble.[16] Ben has a "protective nature" because of his past.[17]
