The university was also formerly home to the Seeds Gallery, a non-profit gallery where students and alumni could show and sell their work. This made NSCAD the only art school in Canada to offer a dedicated commercial gallery, helping students tradition from academia to entrepreneurship.[16] It was founded by SUNSCAD, the students' union, who turned over control of the gallery to the university in 2007.[17] In 2011 the university moved the gallery from Hollis Street to a more peripheral location at the Seaport, where it had to pay rent for the first time.[18] The new space was a 1,000 square feet (93Â m2) gallery in the Annex Building, directly across the street from the Port Campus.[16]
