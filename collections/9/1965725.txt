On 9 August 2003, an open-air stage located 350Â ft from the sea[67] on the sands of the Marina called Seerani Arangam, constructed in 1970,[68] which was used by religious groups and political parties to address gatherings, was demolished by the state government in order to modernise the beach. This spot was a place where rallies were held for the freedom movement during the British Raj, and the stage was considered a symbol of the historical events that had taken place in the Marina.[69][70] This created a great controversy.
