As the mandolin went out of style, information on the instrument, especially its history became hard to find in Naples, where there instrument was born.[127] The term cultural ghettoization has been used to describe the situation where no information is readily available about the mandolin's history, its luthiers, composers, musicians, and the relationship of the instrument to folk music and the "classic Neapolitan song".[127] Tourists arriving in the city were more likely to find such information elsewhere.[127] The city had moved on from mandolins and didn't place particular emphasis on remembering their history or place in Neapolitan culture.[127]
