While Hazlitt showed an "obvious relish"[160] for some of Byron's poetry, on the whole his attitude toward Byron was never simple,[161] and later critics' assessments of Hazlitt's view of Byron's poetry diverge radically. Andrew Rutherford, who includes most of The Spirit of the Age essay on Lord Byron in an anthology of criticism of Byron, himself expresses the belief that Hazlitt had a "distaste for Byron's works".[162] Biographer Duncan Wu, on the other hand, simply notes Hazlitt's admiration for the "power" of Don Juan.[163] Biographer A. C. Grayling asserts that Hazlitt "was consistent in praising his 'intensity of conception and expression' and his 'wildness of invention, brilliant and elegant fancy, [and] caustic wit'."[149] John Kinnaird judges that Hazlitt, in assessing the relative merits of Wordsworth's and Byron's poetry, dismisses too readily as morbid the obsession with death in Byron's poetry, thus minimizing one of its strengths.[164] David Bromwich emphasises the significance of Hazlitt's observation that Byron thought he stood "above his own reputation",[150] pointing out that Hazlitt ties this attitude to Byron's imperfect sympathy with the feelings common to all humanity, which in turn undermines the best in his poetry and diminishes its value relative to the best of Wordsworth's.[165]
