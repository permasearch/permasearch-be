A 2017 study found that nearly one in five VHA women had experienced IPV in the preceding year, and research has shown that many military women reporting IPV experiences in the past year use VHA primary care as their main source of healthcare.[46][47] The VHA does not have an upper age limit for IPV screening, acknowledging that IPV is not limited by age.[47] However, it is believed that early detection is helpful towards allowing victims to access much needed resources earlier and thus the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggests providers especially regularly screen women of childbearing age for IPV.[48] The best care is provided when practitioners do not make assumptions about IPV on the basis of an individualâ€™s sexual orientation or other factors.[47]
