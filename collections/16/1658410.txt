The original incarnation of the group included five MCs: Vinnie Paz, Chief Kamachi, Esoteric, Virtuoso and Bahamadia, along with Jedi Mind Tricks producer [Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]. The group released their debut EP/single "The Five Perfect Exertions b/w War Ensemble" in 1998.[10] Both tracks were later included on Jedi Minds Tricks' 2000 album Violent by Design; with "The Five Perfect Exertions" being remixed into "Exertions Remix", and both "Exertions" and "War Ensemble" shedding Chief Kamachi's appearance. The Army Of The Pharaohs project was put on the back-burner while JMT's career took off.[11] In 2003, AOTP released their debut compilation album Rare Shit, Collabos and Freestyles.[12] It contained various tracks from members of the group.[13]
