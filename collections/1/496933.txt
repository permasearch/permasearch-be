The iPhone 3G and 3GS are compatible with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock.[178] All versions include a USB power adapter, or "wall charger," which allows the iPhone to charge from an AC outlet. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS sold in North America, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru[179][180] include an ultracompact USB power adapter.
