Following matter-of-fact comments made by MasterChef Australia judge Matt Preston about White's son's admitted $500,000 splurge of his father's money on drugs and prostitution,[23] White joined the rival programme Hell's Kitchen Australia in retaliation.[24] In 2016, whilst on The Kyle and Jackie O Show, Preston was asked about Marco Jr.’s time on Big Brother UK, which included his alleged on-air sex and the above admittance to purchasing illicit drugs and sex workers. Preston said "I think it is that terrible thing when you have kids that go off the rails... the drugs might be a little bit of a worry". This sparked a series of profanity-filled social media attack by Marco Jr. which he has since apologised for whilst spruiking his new sex toy collection on the Kyle and Jackie O Show.[23][33] Since quitting MasterChef Australia, Marco Sr has said that “I will never forgive that man [Preston]…with my hand on my mother’s grave I will get that man”.[34]
