The conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty spanned from 1984 to 1986. The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi) is a colossal monument on Liberty Island in New York Harbor and is a part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Much of the restoration effort was based on unprecedented restorative methods, owing largely to the fact that metallurgical repair work on such a scale had never been attempted before. Many professional scientists and engineers, government organizations and various consultants were called in to evaluate and deal with the various problems and tasks facing the restoration effort.
