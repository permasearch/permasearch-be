During the 1950s, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) carried out world leading research into flat plate solar water heaters. A solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in Australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported. Four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies. Despite an excellent solar resource, the penetration of solar water heaters in the Australian domestic market was only about 5% in 2006, with new dwellings accounting for most sales.[49] By 2014, around 14% of Australian households had solar hot water installed [50] It is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system, it could reduce a family's CO2 emissions up to 3Â tonnes per year while saving up to 80% of the energy costs for water heating.[51]
