Straus continued to run the company for twenty years after his partner Farrar died, until 1993 when he sold a majority interest of the company to the privately owned German publishing conglomerate Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.[1] Straus offered FSG to the Holtzbrinck family because of their reputation for publishing serious works of literature.[1]
