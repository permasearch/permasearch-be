Beginning in 2015, the championship starts with pool play, with 16 groups of four players playing round-robin matches, Wednesday through Friday. The winners of each group advance to a single-elimination bracket on the weekend, with the round of 16 and quarterfinals on Saturday, including live prime-time quarterfinals coverage on network television, and the semi-finals, finals, and consolation match on Sunday, with the finals reaching again into prime-time network television.[1]
