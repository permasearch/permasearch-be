On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton became the first, and to date, only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game.[81] Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head.[82] Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later.[83] The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season.[84] Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets, and starting in the 1979â€“80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league wear them.[81]
