The genome size, and the number of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms. The smallest genomes occur in viruses (which can have as few as 2 protein-coding genes),[91] and viroids (which act as a single non-coding RNA gene).[92] Conversely, plants can have extremely large genomes,[93] with rice containing >46,000 protein-coding genes.[94] The total number of protein-coding genes (the Earth's proteome) is estimated to be 5Â million sequences.[95]
