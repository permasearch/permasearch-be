Manoj Nelliyattu "M. Night" Shyamalan[1] (/ˈʃæməlɑːn/;[2] /ˈʃɑːməlɑːn/;[3] Maṉōj Nelliyāṭṭu Śyāmaḷaṉ; Malayalam: മനോജ് നെല്ലിയാട്ട് ശ്യാമളന്‍; Tamil: மனோஜ் நெல்லியட்டு ஷியாமளன் born 6 August 1970)[4] is an American film director, screenwriter, author, producer, and actor known for making movies with contemporary supernatural plots and surprise endings. His most well-received films include the supernatural horror thriller The Sixth Sense (1999), the superhero thriller Unbreakable (2000), the science fiction horror Signs (2002), and the historical drama-horror film The Village (2004). Afterwards, Shyamalan released a series of poorly received but sometimes financially successful movies, including, the dark fantasy film Lady in the Water (2006), the horror thriller film The Happening (2008), the film adaptation of The Last Airbender (2010), and the science-fiction film After Earth (2013). Following the financial failure of After Earth, Shyalaman's career was revived with the release of the found footage horror The Visit (2015) and the psychological horror Split (2016), the latter of which is set in the same universe as his previous film Unbreakable. He was a producer for Devil (2010) and was instrumental in the creation of the Fox science fiction series Wayward Pines.
