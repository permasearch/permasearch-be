Cardiff had become a Free Borough in 1542[34] and further Royal Charters were granted to the town by Elizabeth I in 1600[37] and James I in 1608.[38] In 1573, it was made a head port for collection of customs duties.[31] Pembrokeshire historian George Owen described Cardiff in 1602 as "the fayrest towne in Wales yett not the welthiest.",[31] and the town gained a second Royal Charter in 1608.[39]
