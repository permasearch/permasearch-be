Taking over four years to make,[17] it had a development, marketing, and distribution budget of €40 million,[18] and a 2,000-page long script.[19] Heavy Rain required 170 days of shooting, more than seventy actors and stuntmen, and sixty additional days to animate the faces of fifty actors. It had also sixty sets and 30,000 animations. Guillaume de Fondaumière (CFO of Quantic Dream) claimed it was the most ambitious motion capture project for a game yet.[20][21] The beginning of the game was inspired by an incident where Cage briefly lost his son in a mall, which made him reflect on "what it means to love your son"; this led to the tagline "How far are you prepared to go to save someone you love?"[6][22] Cage structured the game like a film, and wanted to solve the frustration he had with the "game over" message by allowing the story to continue after the death of a playable character.[23] Each character was made to look like their actor counterpart;[24] Madison Paige was modelled after Jacqui Ainsley, who also offered body motion capture and her likeness, while Judi Beecher provided the voice and facial motion capture.[12] To keep the game from being boring, scenes were intentionally short.[6] The user interface was done with Omegame Menus Master.[25] The quick-time event system was based on that of Shenmue.[26] The first design for Heavy Rain was a makeshift motion controller; however, it was not thought feasible at the time.[17] Different difficulty levels were implemented to appeal to a broader sample of players.[21]
