In the three films, Woody makes two strong friendships with Buzz and Jessie. At first, when Buzz temporarily becomes Andy's favorite toy, Woody tries to push him off the dresser but accidentally knocks him out the window. When found and taken by neighborhood bully Sid, however, Woody and Buzz work together to escape. From this point on, he and Buzz are very close. As for fellow "Roundup Gang" member, cowgirl Jessie, though Woody and Jessie argue with each other sometimes, they are still very close friends.
