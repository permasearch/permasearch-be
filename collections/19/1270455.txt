In 1920, the Cuarteto Oriental became a sextet and was renamed as Sexteto Habanero. This group established the "classical" configuration of the son sextet composed of guitar, tres, bongos, claves, maracas and double bass.[27] The sextet members were: Guillermo Castillo, conductor, guitar and second voice; Gerardo Martínez, first voice; Felipe Neri Cabrera, maracas and choir; Ricardo Martínez, tresero, Joaquín Velazco, bongos; and Antonio Bacallao, botija. Abelardo Barroso, one of the most famous soneros, joined the group in 1925.[28]
