The Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford is unanimously denounced by modern scholars. Many contemporary lawyers, and most modern legal scholars, consider the ruling regarding slavery in the territories to be obiter dictum and not a binding precedent. Bernard Schwartz says it "stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisionsâ€”Chief Justice C.E. Hughes called it the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound".[7] Junius P. Rodriguez says it is "universally condemned as the U.S. Supreme Court's worst decision".[8] Historian David Thomas Konig says it was "unquestionably, our court's worst decision ever".[5][9][10]
