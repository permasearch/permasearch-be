Returning to her car, Molly gets a call from the Bemidji PD, saying two FBI agents were at the department looking for her, and were sent to Lou's to find her, and suggests she go over there. Before she goes, she sees Lester watching her from his window. At the diner, Malvo arrives and orders a coffee and a slice of apple pie. Malvo deduces Lou was a cop at one point, Lou tells him he was one for eighteen years. The two of them exchange stories of their previous affiliations with the police, though Malvo doesn't mention his very specifically. Malvo tries to change the subject by asking where he can find Lester's new residence, which Lou doesn't know. Lou becomes suspicious, and brings up the Sioux Falls case, and tells him what happened there, which gets Malvo's attention. Molly pulls into the back parking lot of the shop, and enters through the back door as Malvo exits through the front. Bill and Webb arrive shortly after to ask Molly about the Fargo case. Molly decides to show them her conspiracy board.
