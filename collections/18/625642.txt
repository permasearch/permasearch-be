In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an alliance of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and the custody of the king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion.[73] Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's legal title to the castle was finally confirmed the following year.[74] Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government.[75] Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year.[76] A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign and, when that failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king.[77] Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1327.[78] As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less than ideal location to imprison Edward.[79] The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed to be trying to rescue him.[79] Henry's loyalty was also coming under question.[79] In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards.[80] Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.[81]
