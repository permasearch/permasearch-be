The Labor Party replaced Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 owing to Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard became the first woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election.[426] The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying to wrestle with a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages to a colleague. This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her misogyny speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013.[427] At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.
