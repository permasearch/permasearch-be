Eight-enders are extremely rare in competitive curling and are analogous to a perfect game in baseball or a perfect game in bowling (300). Eight-enders are so rare that the Canadian Curling Association has an eight-ender award to recognize any eight-ender scored in Canada.[1] In 2007 Asham Curling Supplies awarded an $8000 prize randomly to one of the 145 teams that registered an eight-ender in the 2005â€“06 curling season.[2]
