East Village is located close to Stratford International station with fast services to central London (in 5â€“6 minutes) via High Speed One, on Southeastern trains, but not Eurostar, whose trains do not stop at Stratford International station. The Docklands Light Railway gives direct access to much of the east of London, and is one stop from Stratford station, which itself gives access to the Abellio Greater Angliam TFL rail, c2c (weekends only), plus the London Overground, Central line and Jubilee lines of the London Underground.
