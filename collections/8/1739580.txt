In 2013, The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 80.5% of American males aged 14 to 59 years olds from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised. Among racial breakdown, 90.8Â % of non-Hispanic whites males aged 14 to 59 years olds from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised, 75.7% of non-Hispanic blacks males aged 14 to 59 years olds from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised, and 44% of Mexican Americans males aged 14 to 59 years olds from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised. Among hospital circumcision rates, it declined in the United States: from 64.5% in 1979 to 58.3% in 2010.[20] The overall decline was almost entirely due to decline in Western states, from 63.9% in 1979 to 40.2% in 2010.
