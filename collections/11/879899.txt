If one graphs the floating-point value of a bit pattern (x-axis is bit pattern, considered as integers, y-axis the value of the floating-point number; assume positive), one obtains a piecewise linear approximation of a shifted and scaled exponential function with base 2,      2  y     {\displaystyle 2^{y}}   (hence actually     k  2  y − l     {\displaystyle k2^{y-l}}  ). Conversely, given a real number, if one takes the floating-point representation and considers it as an integer, one gets a piecewise linear approximation of a shifted and scaled base 2 logarithm,      log  2   ⁡ ( x )   {\displaystyle \log _{2}(x)}   (hence actually     c  log  2   ⁡ ( x + d )   {\displaystyle c\log _{2}(x+d)}  ), as shown at right.
