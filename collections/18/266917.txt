As of November 3, at least 97 people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane: 54 in Puerto Rico, 28 in Dominica, 5 in the Dominican Republic, 4 in the contiguous United States, 3 in Haiti, 2 in Guadeloupe, and 1 in the United States Virgin Islands. Hundreds of others, mostly in Dominica and Puerto Rico, are still missing. San Juan Mayor Yulín Cruz claimed that the actual death toll in Puerto Rico may actually be as high as 500.[1] Maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair, while the island's lush vegetation had been practically eradicated. The islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs and uprooted trees. Puerto Rico suffered catastrophic damage, including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid. For weeks in Maria's wake, most of the island's population suffered from flooding and lack of resources, compounded by the slow relief process. Total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between $15.9 and $95 billion (2017 USD), mostly in Puerto Rico, making Maria's cost comparable to that of previous Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.[2][3][4][5]
