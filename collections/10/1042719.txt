The practice of carrying relics into battle is a feature that distinguishes medieval warfare from its predecessors or from early modern warfare and possibly inspired by biblical references.[19] The presence of relics was believed to be an important source of supernatural power that served both as a spiritual weapon and a form of defence; the relics of martyrs were considered by Saint John Chrysostom much more powerful than "walls, trenches, weapons and hosts of soldiers"[20]
