Vaughn Miller (Eric Christian Olsen) is a usually shirtless, earth-friendly, mellow "neo-hippie" student who is the lead singer of a light-reggae band at Greendale Community College.[19] A frequent hacky sack and Ultimate Frisbee player, he has had several notable interactions with the show's main characters, as he initially dated Britta and was in a band with Pierce. Though he at first seems very laid-back and peaceful, he started writing popular hate songs about Britta and Pierce after his relationships with them turned sour ("Home Economics"). However, he and Annie began a relationship, much to the bemusement of Jeff, Britta, and Troy and later, Shirley.[19]  At the end of the first season, he transfers to a community college in Delaware because of their strong hacky-sack athletic program, and Annie initially decided to join him there before changing her mind. He was the cause of the bond between Jeff and Shirley in the first season, due to his small nipples, which Shirley finds hilarious. This is also referenced by them in season 3.
