From 1999 through 2014, it was a single-elimination event. Since 2011, all matches have been over 18 holes, with extra holes if necessary. Previously, the final match was played over 36 holes. The losers of the semi-final matches play an 18-hole consolation match for third place. The format was a five-day, six-match tournament starting on Wednesday. For the first four days (Wednesday through Saturday) a single round of matches were played, with the semi-finals, third-place match and final played on Sunday. When the final was 36 holes, the quarter-finals and semi-finals were both played on Saturday.
