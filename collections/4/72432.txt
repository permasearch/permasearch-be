Project GOAL (Greater Opportunities for Athletes to Learn) is located in Central Falls, RI, just outside Providence. Project GOAL was founded in October 2004 with just 20 children involved. It has since tripled in size.[11] In a personal interview, Darius Shirzadi, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Project GOAL, emphasized that by playing soccer children learn "respect, responsibility, and accountability." The organization uses soccer to encourage team members to work towards academic improvement.[12] In doing so, the team members acquire new lifelong abilities. 97% of participating students have gone on to become the first in their families to attend college.[13]
