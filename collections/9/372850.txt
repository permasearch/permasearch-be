The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the Sun, Venus and the Moon. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to Kukulcan, are perhaps those most often described as "observatories" by modern ruin tour-guides. Somewhat recent studies can corroborate this description of one such building, called "El Caracol", but there is no evidence that such buildings were so used exclusively, and temple pyramids of other shapes may well have been used for observation as well. They were used to see the equinox and other astronomical phenomenons.
