According to some versions, including comments from some of the kids standing outside the store,[32] Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant. Till's cousin, Simeon Wright, who was with him at the store stated Till whistled at Bryant, saying  "I think [Emmett] wanted to get a laugh out of us or something," furthering "He was always joking around, and it was hard to tell when he was serious."  Wright stated that following the whistle he became immediately alarmed saying "Well, it scared us half to death," and "You know, we were almost in shock. We couldn't get out of there fast enough, because we had never heard of anything like that before. A black boy whistling at a white woman? In Mississippi? No."  Wright stated  "the Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives".[29][33] Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering.[34] His speech was sometimes unclear; his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing "b" sounds, and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum.[35][36][37] She said that, to help with his articulation, she taught Till how to whistle softly to himself before pronouncing his words.[36]
