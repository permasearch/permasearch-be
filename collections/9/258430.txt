Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track "Long, Long, Long",[14] Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for "Something".[15] In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna;[16] in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: "all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see."[17] By 1996, Harrison had denied writing "Something" for Boyd,[9] telling music journalist Paul Cashmere that "everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie" because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed each member of the band with his respective wife.[18][19]
