In Belgium, weapons that launch a projectile without the use of a combustion/fire are unrestricted, it is stipulated as a free-to-purchase weapon which can be only bought by persons aged 18 years or older, as checked from any form of identification. The only exclusions are those on the Forbidden Weapons List. This includes those used for airsoft and Paintball. However, if a weapon is shorter than 60 cm, or has a barrel shorter than 30 cm and shoots 7.5 joules of energy (0.20g pellet travelling at 273.9 m/s or 898.5 ft/s) or above (measured 2.5 meters from the muzzle), it is classified as a firearm and needs registration.
