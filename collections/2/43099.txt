On February 16, 2016, producer Roy Lee, in an interview with Collider.com, mentioned a second film, remarking that: "[Dauberman] wrote the most recent draft working with [Muschietti], so it's being envisioned as two movies."[295] On July 19, 2017, Muschietti revealed that the plan is to get production underway for the sequel to It next spring, adding,[296][297] "We'll probably have a script for the second part in January [2018]. Ideally, we would start prep in March. Part one is only about the kids. Part two is about these characters 30 years later as adults, with flashbacks to 1989 when they were kids."[298][299] On July 21, 2017, Muschietti spoke of looking forward to having a dialogue in the second film that does not exist within the first, stating, "... it seems like we're going to do it. It's the second half, it's not a sequel. It's the second half and it's very connected to the first one."[300][301] Muschietti confirmed that two cut scenes from the film will hopefully be included in the second, one of which being the fire at the Black Spot from the book.[302]
