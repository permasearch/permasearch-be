Weeks later, the NFL owners gathered in Houston for a meeting on January 12 and January 13, a meeting that decided the end of the Los Angeles race. A few days before the scheduled owners meeting, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones suggested that the St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) and San Diego Chargers should share Stan Kroenke's Inglewood Stadium. This suggestion was taken as a possible option discussed in the Houston meetings. During the Los Angeles meeting, the Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, which consists of six NFL owners, favored the Carson project over the Rams' Inglewood project. However, in the first round of voting during the meeting, the Rams and the Inglewood proposal got the greater amount of votes than the Carson project with the former receiving 21 votes and the latter receiving 11 votes. However, the Rams and the Inglewood proposal did not meet the required 24 votes. In the second round of voting, the Rams' Inglewood project received 20 votes with the Chargers and Raiders Carson proposal only having 12. Eventually, the Inglewood proposal received 30 votes and the Carson proposal receiving only 2; meaning that, after 21 consecutive seasons without an NFL franchise, Los Angeles finally had an NFL team.[71] All three teams filed the required paperwork to relocate on January 4.[50][51]
