A child prodigy, O'Sullivan began playing snooker at age 7, made his first competitive century break at the age of 10, and became British Under-16 Champion at age 13. He made his first competitive maximum break in 1991, aged 15, and won the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship as well as Junior Pot Black in the same year. He turned professional in 1992, aged 16, and achieved his first major professional success when he won the 1993 UK Championship at the age of 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a ranking title, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player ever to have won the Masters, having captured his first title in 1995 at the age of 19 years and 69 days.[9][10]
