A web content management system (WCMS)[1] is a software content management system (CMS) specifically for web content.  It provides website authoring, collaboration, and administration tools that help users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup languages create and manage website content.  A WCMS provides the foundation for collaboration, providing users the ability to manage documents and output for multiple author editing and participation.  Most systems use a content repository or a database to store page content, metadata, and other information assets the  system needs.
