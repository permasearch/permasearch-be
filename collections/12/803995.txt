The Russian Navy cancelled its Typhoon modernisation program in March 2012, stating that modernising one Typhoon would be as expensive as building two new Borei-class submarines.[6] With the announcement that Russia has eliminated the last SS-N-20 Sturgeon SLBMs in September 2012, the remaining Typhoons have reached the end of service.[7]
