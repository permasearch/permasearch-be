The three-part appearance of many insect bodies and the two-part appearance of spiders is a result of this grouping;[14] in fact there are no external signs of segmentation in mites.[11] Arthropods also have two body elements that are not part of this serially repeated pattern of segments, an acron at the front, ahead of the mouth, and a telson at the rear, behind the anus. The eyes are mounted on the acron.[11]
