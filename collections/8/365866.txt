However, to comply with the European Bologna process, in 1998 a new educational law reintroduced the bachelor's degree (first degree after three years of study) in Germany. Today, these degrees can be called either "Bakkalaureus" or "Bachelor" (in accordance with federal law), but the English term is more common. According to the Bologna modell, the Bachelor is followed by the post-graduate master's degree of another two years. The traditional degrees of Diplom and Magister were mostly abolished in 2010, the Diplom still remains in a few subjects and universities and has been reintroduced as alternative degree in some places.
