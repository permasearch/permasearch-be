Du Bois was married twice, first to Nina Gomer (m. 1896, d. 1950), with whom he had two children, a son Burghardt (who died as an infant) and a daughter Yolande, who became a high-school teacher in Baltimore after attending Fisk University.[294] With her father's support, Yolande married Countee Cullen, a famous poet of the Harlem Renaissance.[295] As a widower, Du Bois married Shirley Graham (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to Du Bois and took his stepfather's name; he also worked for African-American causes.[296] The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.[297]
