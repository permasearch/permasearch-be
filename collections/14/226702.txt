In a future visited by the Hulk where Earth had been decimated by nuclear wars, Thor's hammer was one of the many mementos of the age of heroes kept by the now-elderly Rick Jones; the Maestro—the Hulk's twisted future self—attempted to use the hammer against the Hulk during their second confrontation in Rick's museum of hero memorabilia, but failed to lift it even with Thor's death as he was naturally unworthy to do so.[111] A later storyline set before the Hulk's fight with the Maestro featured the elder Rick working with his younger self to defeat Thanatos- another alternate Rick- by using his own ability to summon and lift the hammer, explaining that he had been judged worthy to use it for things that young Rick had yet to do and Thanatos would never achieve.[112] In a similar but alternate dystopian future, Mjolnir also rests in a super-hero artifact vault overseen by Rick Jones.[113]
