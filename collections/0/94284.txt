Filming began on March 1, 1960, on location in Mexico, where both the village and the U.S. border town were built for the film. The location filming was in Cuernavaca, Durango, and Tepoztl√°n and at the Churubusco Studios.[11] The first scene shot was the first part of the six gunfighters' journey to the Mexican village, prior to Chico being brought into the group.[citation needed]
