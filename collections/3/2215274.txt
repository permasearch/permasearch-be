Starting in 2014 the Homestead Trolley began seasonal service to Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park. The free Homestead National Parks Trolley is offered by the City of Homestead in partnership with the National Park Service. Operating on weekends between January and April, the service is the only public transportation option available to these two parks.[20][21][22][23]
