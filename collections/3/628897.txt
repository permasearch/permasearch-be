In the next life, Harry finds that almost all Cronus Clubs have been attacked by Vincent, and many of the few Ouroborans that are still alive have had their memories erased. In the next few lives, Vincent is accelerating the pace of technology so he can get closer to completing the quantum mirror. In the later years of their lives, Harry sees that global warming is also accelerated because of the more quickly industrialized world. He connects this to the warning of the end of the world from the Cronus Club previously.
