During the first half of 1970, Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP.[233] Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as The Cry of Love.[243] He had started writing songs for the album in 1968, but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned.[233] Soon afterward, he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the L.A. Forum, performing for 20,000 people.[244] Set-lists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material.[244] Several shows were recorded, and they produced some of Hendrix's most memorable live performances. At one of them, the second Atlanta International Pop Festival, on July 4, he played to the largest American audience of his career.[245] According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, as many as 500,000 people attended the concert.[245] On July 17, they appeared at the New York Pop Festival; Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show, and the set was considered a disaster.[246] The American leg of the tour, which included 32 performances, ended at Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 1, 1970.[247] This would be Hendrix's final concert appearance in the U.S.[248]
