Francis, played by Christopher Kennedy Masterson (118 episodes), is the oldest of the brothers, whom Malcolm often looks up to. It is revealed in the episodes "Sleepover" and "The Bots and the Bees" in season one that Francis was a breech birth, and in "Flashback" in season 2, that Lois was in labor with him during her and Hal's wedding. A rebel from birth, showing signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, he was exiled to the Marlin Academy military school by Lois for his behavior. He eventually emancipated himself to run away from the academy to work in Alaska, incurring his mother's wrath. Upon moving to Alaska, he marries a local woman named Piama, who is about one year older than him, and had previously been married briefly, and whom Lois does not like. During the fourth and fifth season, Francis works at a dude ranch owned by Otto Mannkusser and his wife Gretchen. In the series finale, Hal discovers that Francis has taken a job with Amerysis Industries, a large corporation where Francis works in a cubicle and inputs numbers into a computer. Although Francis enjoys the job, he has no intention of telling Lois about it, as he also enjoys torturing her by telling her that he is still unemployed.
