Paul shares similarities with the biblical Jesus in his forgiving and open nature, as well as his long hair and beard. He is also shown to be extremely tactical, though sometimes letting his fury and emotions get the better of him. In addition to these, he has been shown to be a highly skilled combatant, being able to defeat his opponent while completely unarmed (instead using his hands and feet as a primary weapon). It can be assumed because of this that he has had formal training of a military and/or martial nature. He also has skills as an escape artist, and has shown himself to be a competent tracker.
