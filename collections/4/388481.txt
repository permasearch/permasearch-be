Merida is the eleventh Disney princess, first appearing in the Pixar film Brave (2012).[3] Voiced by Kelly Macdonald, the character's singing voice is provided by Julie Fowlis. She was created by director and screenwriter Brenda Chapman. Merida is the 16-year-old daughter of Queen Elinor, who rules the kingdom alongside King Fergus. Queen Elinor's expectations of her daughter make Merida see her mother as being distant while also causing friction between the two. Despite Elinor's desire to see Merida as a proper royal lady, Merida is an impetuous girl who wants to take control of her own destiny. She has honed her skill in archery and is one of the most skilled archers ever seen. She is also skilled in sword-fighting and cross-country horse riding on her horse, Angus. Merida was "coronated" and officially became a part of the Disney Princess franchise on May 11, 2013, at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.[67]
