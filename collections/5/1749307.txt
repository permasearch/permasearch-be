The fourth element is that the parties must create an intention to create legal relations. The intention requirement has often been approached on the basis that parties to commercial arrangements are presumed to intend legal consequences,[63] while parties to social or domestic agreements are presumed not to intend legal consequences.[64] Such presumptions determine who bears the onus of proof.[63] In Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA, a case relating to the engagement of a minister of religion, the High Court was, however, critical of the utility of a language of presumptions in this context.[64][65]
