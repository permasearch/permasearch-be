Secondhand Lions received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 59% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 133 critics, with a consensus stating "a wholesome but schmaltzy movie." Roger Ebert gave the movie a positive review of three stars out of a possible four, stating "the movie, written and directed by Tim McCanlies, is a gentle, sweet, and attentive movie about a boy who learns how to believe from his two uncles. A classic dramedy? Maybe not, but a feel-good family film that you'll remember even if the plot is basic and the movie is schmaltzy."
