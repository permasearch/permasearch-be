The Hunter gathered positive reviews during its launch period. However, it received "Mostly Negative" reviews on Steam due to the inability to hunt different kinds of animals without an in-game hunting license. A player can buy hunting licenses with in-game currency or real money to get a membership. The standalone expansion received a "Mixed" review for the same reason. Metacritic gave The Hunter: Primal a score of 49 out of 100.
