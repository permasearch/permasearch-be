Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (also known as Oswald the Rabbit or Oswald Rabbit) is an anthropomorphic rabbit and animated cartoon character created by Walt Disney for funny animal films and distributed by Universal Studios in the 1920s and 1930s, serving as the Disney studio's first animated character to feature in their own series. 27 animated Oswald one-reelers were produced at Walt Disney Animation Studios (the Walt Disney Studio at the time). In 1928, Charles Mintz took the rights of Oswald from Walt Disney and claimed Oswald as an official Universal Studios character. In November 1928, as a replacement to compete with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Ub Iwerks created Mickey Mouse for the Walt Disney Studio.[3]
