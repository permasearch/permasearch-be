The Mist Mountain Formation is the middle unit of the Kootenay Group. It rests conformably on the cliff-forming sandstones of the Moose Mountain Member of the Morrissey Formation, and is conformably overlain by the Elk Formation. In the eastern foothills, the Elk Formation has been removed by erosion and the Mist Mountain Formation is unconformably overlain by the Cadomin Formation. North of the North Saskatchewan River, the Mist Mountain Formation grades into the Nikanassin Formation. Correlation south of the Canadaâ€“United States border is uncertain.[3]
