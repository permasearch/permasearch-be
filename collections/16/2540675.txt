In an attempt to revitalize Redwood City's downtown, city officials decided to look into development. In February 1999 the San Mateo County History Museum opened inside the old San Mateo County Courthouse in downtown Redwood City.[22] The courthouse had been built in 1910 and in the late '30s an addition was built in front of the original structure, obscuring the view. The addition was torn down and been replaced with a large courtyard flanked by water fountains on either side, leading to the main steps of the courthouse as part of the revitalization. The courthouse's glass dome is lit at night and changes colors every 11 seconds.
