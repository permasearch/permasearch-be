Principal photography began on August 10, 2017,[47] under the working title Mary Lou 2,[48] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[49] with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[50] Also in the month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[51] Feige stated that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but instead decided to shoot them back-to-back explaining, "We're doing them one right after another. It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselvesâ€”again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie."[52] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members, even though each part is its own distinct film,[53] and suggested that "some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth."[50] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[54] although additional filming is scheduled to take place in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland in July 2018,[55] with reshoots scheduled for late 2018.[56]
