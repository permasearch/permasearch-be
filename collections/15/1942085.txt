Out of the mist and hum of that low land,  Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,  Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste, Under the solitary moon: — he flowed  Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè, Brimming, and bright, and large: then sands begin  To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,  And split his currents; that for many a league  The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along  Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles —  Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had  In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,  A foiled circuitous wanderer: — till at last  The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide  His luminous home of waters opens, bright  And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars  Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea. ~ Matthew Arnold, Sohrab and Rustum
