The first season of the Fairy Tail anime series was directed by Shinji Ishihira and produced by A-1 Pictures and Satelight.[1] It follows the first adventures of Natsu Dragneel and Lucy Heartfilia of the fictional guild, Fairy Tail. The season adapts the first 16 volumes of Hiro Mashima's Fairy Tail manga series. Natsu befriends Lucy who joins the titular guild and later goes on missions with her to earn money along with fellow wizards Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet, as well as Natsu's flying cat, Happy. The five go on a forbidden S-Class mission with Gray and Erza to save Galuna Island and fight Gray's rival Lyon Vastia. Shortly after, the guildhall is attacked by their rival guild Phantom Lord, leading into a guild war. After the dissolution of Phantom Lord, the group learns of Erza's past as a slave in the Tower of Heaven and confront Jellal Fernandez to destroy the tower. Lastly, once back at Fairy Tail, Natsu and the others face Laxus Dreyar and the Raijin Tribe as they stage a coup in Fairy Tail.
