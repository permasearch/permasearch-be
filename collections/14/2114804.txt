Tissue valves tend to wear out faster with increased flow demands - such as with a more active (typically younger) person. Tissue valves are increasing lasting longer - now typically approximately 20 years, but they might wear out faster in younger people.[3] When a tissue valve wears out and needs replacement, the person must undergo another valve replacement surgery. For this reason, younger patients often receive mechanical valves to prevent the increased risk (and inconvenience) of another valve replacement.[citation needed]
