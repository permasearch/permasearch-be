Temperature reflects the average randomized kinetic energy of constituent particles of matter (i.e., atoms or molecules) relative to the centre of mass of the system, while heat is the transfer of energy across a system boundary into the body other than by work or matter transfer. Translation, rotation, and vibration of atoms represent the degrees of freedom of motion which classically contribute to the heat capacity of gases, while only vibrations are needed to describe the heat capacities of most solids,[2] as shown by the Dulongâ€“Petit law. Other contributions can come from magnetic[3] and electronic[4] degrees of freedom in solids, but these rarely make substantial contributions.
