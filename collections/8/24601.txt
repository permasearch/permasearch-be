The North American Electric Reliability Corporation predicted minor impacts,[141] and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse.[142] In California, solar power was projected to decrease by 4â€“6,000 megawatts[143] at 70 MW/minute, and then ramp up by 90 MW/minute as the shadow passes. CAISO's typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute.[144] Around 4 GW mainly in North Carolina and Georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured.[143]
