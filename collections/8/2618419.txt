Arabic paganism gradually disappeared during Muhammad's era through Islamization.[51][52][52] The sacred months of the Arab pagans were the 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islamic calendar.[53] After Muhammad had conquered Mecca he set out to convert the pagans.[54][55][56] One of the last military campaigns that Muhammad ordered against the Arab pagans was the Demolition of Dhul Khalasa. It occurred in April and May 632 AD, in 10AH of the Islamic Calendar. Dhul Khalasa is referred to as both an idol and a temple, and it was known by some as the Ka'ba of Yemen, built and worshipped by pagan tribes.[57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65]
