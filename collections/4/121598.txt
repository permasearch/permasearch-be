Hoping to stay in The Good Place, Eleanor decides to hide her morally imperfect past behavior from everyone else, confessing only to her assigned soulmate, Chidi Anagonye (Harper), a university ethics professor. Chidi agrees to teach Eleanor to become a better person and avoid eternal torture in "The Bad Place". She also interacts closely with a particular group of other people in "The Good Place", notably Tahani Al-Jamil (Jamil), a wealthy philanthropist who dedicated her life to helping the poor and raised billions through charities, and Tahani's soulmate Jianyu Li (Jacinto), seemingly a silent Buddhist monk from Taiwan, who turns out to be Jason Mendoza, a misplaced music DJ from Florida. Michael and the inhabitants are assisted by Janet (Carden), an artificial being in charge of helping and informing the inhabitants.
