Marie-Philip Poulin-Nadeau (born March 28, 1991) is a Canadian ice hockey forward, playing for Les Canadiennes de Montreal. Poulin was a member of the Canada women's national ice hockey teams that won the gold medal at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver and 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and had previously played for the team Dawson College Blues. She has been referred to as the Sidney Crosby of women's hockey for her high level of achievement at a young age.[1] She has the unique distinction of having scored the game winning goal in the gold medal games in the first two Olympics in which she competed. She also scored the second goal to give the Canadians the lead in the 2018 Winter Olympics gold medal game until Monique Lamoureux tied the game with 6:21 remaining.
