According to Piaget, children within this age group are often "egocentric," believing that what they feel and experience is the same as everyone else's feelings and experiences.[32] Also at this age, there is often a lack of ability to understand that there may be other explanations for events outside of the realm of things they have already comprehended. What happens outside their understanding needs to be explained using what they already know, because of an inability to fully comprehend abstract concepts.[32]
