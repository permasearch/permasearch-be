"Cactus Bowl" had been the originally planned name for what became the Copper Bowl in 1989.[4] The game was played under the Copper Bowl name through 1996, after which title sponsorship rights were assumed by Insight Enterprises, who self-titled the game from 1997 through the 2011. In 2012, restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings became the sponsor and self-titled the game for two years.[5] Buffalo Wild Wings declined to renew sponsorship following the 2013 game,[6] at which time organizers opted to rename the game "Cactus Bowl" rather than reverting to the Copper Bowl name. There had been a Texas-based Cactus Bowl played in Division II, however that game was discontinued after 2011. For 2014, TicketCity sponsored the new Cactus Bowl,[7] and Motel 6 became the sponsor in 2015.[8]
