Test cricket between England and Australia was well established by the time the Australians visited England in the 1890 season. The two countries played 15 series between 1890 and 1914, including the 1912 Triangular Tournament in which South Africa took part. It was during the "Golden Age" that Test cricket first achieved its hegemony over other forms of first-class cricket.[citation needed]
