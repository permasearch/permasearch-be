where β0 is a non-random, known constant which may or may not match the actual unknown parameter value β, and     s . e . (    β ^    )   {\displaystyle s.e.({\hat {\beta }})}   is the standard error of the estimator         β ^       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\hat {\beta }}}   for β. By default, statistical packages report t-statistic with β0 = 0 (these t-statistics are used to test the significance of corresponding regressor). However, when t-statistic is needed to test the hypothesis of the form H0: β = β0, then a non-zero β0 may be used.
