where g represents the respective force of the centrifuge and r the radius from the center of the rotor to a point in the sample.[5] However, depending on the centrifuge model used, the respective angle of the rotor and the radius may vary, thus the formula gets modified. For example, the Sorvall #SS-34 rotor has a maximum radius of 10.8Â cm, so the formula becomes     R P M = 299    g r      {\displaystyle RPM=299{\sqrt {g \over r}}}  , which can further simplify to     R P M = 91   g     {\displaystyle RPM=91{\sqrt {g}}}  .[6] the applied centrifugation field is square angular velocity in radians per sec .the radial distance o the particle from the axis;
