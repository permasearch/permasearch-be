The 2009–10 season was far better, with the club pushing for a playoff place at the turn of the year. A run of 9 wins in 10 League games saw the club with a chance of making the playoffs, only for this to fade in March/April. The emergence of the Michael Symes and Bobby Grant partnership was a key aspect and, following their achievements throughout the season, both moved on to bigger clubs. In terms of cup performance the club was superb, reaching the 2nd round of the League Cup losing only 1–2 to Queens Park Rangers, the quarter-finals of the Football League Trophy losing 0–2 to Leeds United, and the 4th round of the FA Cup losing 1–3 to Premier League team Fulham.
