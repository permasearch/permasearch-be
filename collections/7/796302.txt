Howard's exact age is uncertain. In the episode "Party" when Vince tells him that fifty isn't that old, he corrects Vince by telling him that he is only thirty-two and goes on to state that that is ten years older than Vince is. Yet in "Fountain of Youth", during a flashback to the pair's school days, he exclaims that he is the same age as Vince, despite looking much older, and it's mentioned several times throughout the series that they went to both primary school and college together.
