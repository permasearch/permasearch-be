The iconic Bulls' logo is a charging red bull's face (seen at left). The logo was designed by noted American graphic designer Dean P. Wessel[50] and was adopted in 1966. At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 1970s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says "Windy City" below the bull's nose.
