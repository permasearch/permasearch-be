On 2 June 1995, Detective Constable John Burrell was acquitted on the directions of the judge, Mr Justice Mantell.[31] Detective Sergeant Linda Evans and Detective Constable Colin Whitby were found not guilty by the jury on 14 June 1995.[32] Following the trial, the Police Complaints Authority announced that there would be no internal disciplinary inquiry.[29][33] The PCA said that "a disciplinary charge of authority would in substance be the same as the criminal charge of which the officers have been acquitted" and "an officer cannot be tried on both criminal and discipline charges for the same offence".[5]
