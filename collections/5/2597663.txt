McGraw attended Shawnee Mission North High School in  Overland Park, Kansas. In 1968, he was awarded a football scholarship to the University of Tulsa, where he played middle linebacker under Coach Glenn Dobbs. On November 23 of that year, McGraw's team lost to the University of Houston 100â€“6, which is one of the most lopsided games in college football history.[8] Coach Dobbs retired after that season and McGraw transferred to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.
