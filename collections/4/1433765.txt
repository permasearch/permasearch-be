In November 2001, the Northern Alliance captured Kabul after the Taliban had abandoned it. A month later a new government under President Hamid Karzai began to assemble. In the meantime, a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Afghanistan. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as many expatriate Afghans returned to the country. The city's population grew from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3Â million in recent years. Many foreign embassies re-opened.
