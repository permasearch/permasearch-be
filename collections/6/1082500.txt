The Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) includes 73 statutory Inspectors General of a number of large governmental agencies as well as smaller independent agencies. The Inspector General Act of 1978, amended by the IG Reform Act of 2008, established the CIGIE that consists of seven committees: Audit, Human Resources, Information Technology, Inspection and Evaluation, Investigations, Integrity, and Legislation. The CIGIE addresses integrity, economy, and effectiveness issues that transcend individual government agencies; and increases the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel. The CIGIE develops policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well-trained and highly skilled workforce. DoD IG is an active participant in the CIGIE, serving as a member of the CIGIE Executive Council; as chair of the CIGIE Information Technology Committee; and as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Public Inquiry.
