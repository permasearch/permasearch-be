The Byrds also recorded a version of the song in 1968 and issued it as a single.[5][6] The Byrds' version is notable for being the first commercial release of the song, predating Dylan's first release by three years.[3][6][7] A later cover by Byrds members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman reached the top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts in 1989. The song has also been covered by many other artists, including Joan Baez, Unit 4 + 2, Earl Scruggs, Old Crow Medicine Show, Phish, Counting Crows, The Dandy Warhols, Tedeschi Trucks Band, and Glen Hansard with Markéta Irglová.[8]
