Emerson's line "the shot heard round the world" is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution,[citation needed] and the opening stanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French Minute Man statue dedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875 commemoration of the original battle.[14] "Concord Hymn" established Emerson as a poet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist.[11] Emerson biographer Robert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he ever wrote.[15] Concord's centennial celebration of Emerson's birth in 1903 ended with a singing of the hymn.[1]
