The Sultan Ahmed Mosque is one of the three mosques in Turkey that has six minarets (the other two being the modern Sabanc覺 Mosque in Adana and the Hz. Mikdat Mosque in Mersin). According to folklore, an architect misheard the Sultan's request for "alt覺n minareler" (gold minarets) as "alt覺 minare" (six minarets), at the time a unique feature of the mosque of the Ka'aba in Mecca. When criticized for his presumption, the Sultan then ordered a seventh minaret to be built at the Mecca mosque.[12]
