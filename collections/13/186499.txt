After the American Civil War and Cuba's Ten Years' War, US businessmen began monopolizing the devalued sugar markets in Cuba. In 1894, 90% of Cuba's total exports went to the United States, which also provided 40% of Cuba's imports.[32] Cuba's total exports to the US were almost twelve times larger than the export to her mother country, Spain.[33] US business interests indicated that while Spain still held political authority over Cuba, economic authority in Cuba, acting-authority, was shifting to the US.
