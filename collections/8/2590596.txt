When Monica returns, she checks her answering-machine messages and hears a message from her ex-boyfriend Richard (voice of Tom Selleck). She is unable to determine whether the message was left before or after they broke up (as depicted in the 2nd-season finale, two episodes ago). In a fit of insecurity, she breaks into his voicemail, and hears a message left by another woman, leading her to believe that Richard has already begun seeing someone else. Chandler suggests the woman might be Richard's daughter Michelle (uncredited voice role), and Monica confirms this by prank-calling her. Unfortunately, Michelle calls her back, and Monica admits her indiscretions. She is unable to secure Michelle's silence on the matter, so she breaks into Richard's voicemail again to erase all his messages and record a new one. However, she has the misfortune to delete and re-record his outgoing message, humiliating herself to all the world.
