In the post-World War II era, a new framework to structure the international system emerged with the U.S. rather than Britain as the key power. In 1944, a multi-nation group forged formal institutions to structure the post-war international economy. The Bretton Woods agreements created the International Monetary Fund, to stabilize the financial system and exchange raters, and the World Bank, to supply capital for infrastructure projects. The U.S. was focused on the rebuilding of Western European economies, and Latin America did not initially benefit from these new institutions. However, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947, did have Argentina, Chile and Cuba as signatories.[116] GATT had a legal structure to promote international trade by reducing tariffs. The Uruguay Round of GATT talks (1986â€“1994) resulted in the formation of the World Trade Organization.[117]
