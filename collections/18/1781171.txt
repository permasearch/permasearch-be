The Daily Telegraph has been politically conservative in modern times.[30] The personal links between the paper's editors and the leadership of the Conservative Party, along with the paper's generally right-wing stance and influence over Conservative activists, have resulted in the paper commonly being referred to, especially in Private Eye, as the Torygraph.[30] Even when Conservative support was shown to have slumped in the opinion polls and Labour gained the ascendant (particularly when leader Tony Blair rebranded the party as "New Labour" on becoming leader after the death of John Smith in 1994), the newspaper remained loyal to the Conservatives. This loyalty continued after Labour ousted the Conservatives from power by a election result in 1997, and in the face of Labour election wins in 2001 and the third successive Labour election win in 2005.
