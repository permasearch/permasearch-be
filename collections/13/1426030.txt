The 1985 season began with Reb being transferred to Blackmoor after fighting with Myra and promising Joan that she would be back for her. Pixie Mason was raped by male inmate Frank Burke, and lapsed into catatonia. Len Murphy would temporarily become governor after Ann collapsed at work soon after the kidnapping ordeal, deputy governor Meg was still in hospital recovering from her own injuries, and Joyce turned down the opportunity;[nb 21] he would soon be arrested for raping Pixie in a frame-up orchestrated by Joan. Male inmates McRae and Delaney would be involved in affairs with Myra and Marlene, respectively. Lou tried several times to kill Myra in her bid to become top dog, with one attempt leading instead to the death of another inmate, artist Samantha Greenway (Robyn Gibbes); she also attempted to kill Joan Ferguson with a home-made zip gun made by Frank Burke, only to severely injure her hand when the gun jammed.
