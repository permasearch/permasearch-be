Fantasy Flight Games produced Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, based on the 2003 re-imagined series. It is a semi-cooperative game of strategy for 3â€“6 players with some players being Cylon agents, either aware at start of the game or become aware later, as Sleeper agents. Each of the 10 playable character has its own abilities and weaknesses, and they must all work together in order for humanity to survive, as well as attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threaten to tear the fleet apart.[43] In June 2009, a "Pegasus expansion" to the board game was announced, adding seven new characters and extra gameboards representing Battlestar Pegasus and New Caprica.[44] A further expansion, Exodus was released in December 2010 [45] and Daybreak, the final expansion, was released in Summer of 2013.
