The Chairman is formally elected by the Supreme People's Assembly (article 91:5[96]) and serves for terms of office of five years (articles 101[95] & 90:1[96]); but in practice, the office is hereditary within the Kim Dynasty, as the late Kim Jong-il was posthumously designated as "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", while his son, Kim Jong-un, was appointed as the "First Chairman of the National Defence Commission".[97]
