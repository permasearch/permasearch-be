Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes’s decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team’s roster in less than a month. Tyndall led the 2015 team, which was picked to finish second to last in the SEC,[citation needed] to a 16–16 record. Shortly after being hired, Tyndall was informed of an NCAA investigation into violations that occurred while he was the head coach at Southern Mississippi.[citation needed] After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause because of information indicating his guilt in these violations.[citation needed]
