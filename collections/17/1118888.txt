Public Works and Government Services Canada undertook work during the 41st Parliament to determine how the seating arrangement could be modified to accommodate the additional 30 seats added in the 2015 election.  Ultimately, new "theater" seats were designed, with five seats in a row at one desk, the seats pulling down for use.  Such seat sets now comprise almost the entire length of the last two rows on each side of the chamber.[24] Additionally, the current chamber will undergo renovations starting 2018 and relocate during the period of reconstruction to the courtyard of the West Block.[25]
