English (General American) and Hawaiian are listed as Hawaii's "official languages" in the state's 1978 constitution. Article XV, Section 4 specifies that "Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law". HawaiÊ»i Creole English, locally referred to as "Pidgin", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others.[citation needed]
