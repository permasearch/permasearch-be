There is an important relationship between clearance, elimination half-life and distribution volume. The elimination rate constant of a drug Κel is equivalent to total clearance divided by the distribution volume (Κel=Cltot/Vd)(note the usage of Cl and not Κ, not to confuse with Κel). But Κel is also equivalent to ln2 divided by elimination rate half-life t1/2 (Κel=ln2t1/2). Thus, Cltot = ln2 Vd/t1/2. This means, for example, that an increase in elimination rate half-life results in an increased total clearance, provided distribution volume is constant. Derivation of these equations can be found in e.g Rang and Dale's Pharmacology [6]
