The statewide investigations program provides specialized investigative services to State departments and agencies and may collaborate with other jurisdictions on projects of mutual concern. It involves the conduct of a broad range of investigations of suspected or actual violations of criminal, civil, and other administrative laws, rules and regulations. The investigation cases are highly sensitive and confidential in nature, dealing with crimes of fraud, theft, corruption, violence, and subversive activities which involve government officials and employees.
