According to historical sources such as the Old Book of Tang, New Book of Tang and Zizhi Tongjian, Li Yuan, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty, used a similar strategy in 618 CE in a battle against the Turks before he started his rebellion against the Sui dynasty. In early 618, Li Yuan was still a Sui general and his base was Jinyang (晉陽; present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi). When he heard rumours that Emperor Yang wanted to execute him, he started making preparations for a rebellion against the Sui dynasty to save himself. In May 618, the Turks allied with the warlord Liu Wuzhuo to attack the Sui dynasty in order to gain territory. Jinyang became one of their targets.
