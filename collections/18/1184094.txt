ICS was initially developed to address problems of inter-agency responses to wildfires in California and Arizona but is now a component of the National Incident Management System (NIMS)[2] in the US, where it has evolved into use in All-Hazards situations, ranging from active shootings to HazMat scenes.[3] In addition, ICS has acted as a pattern for similar approaches internationally.[4]
