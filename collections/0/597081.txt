The year 1978 was also the year when Maurice and EWF's managers, Cavallo and Ruffalo, worked out a deal for the launch of a new record label called The American Recording Company (ARC), to be distributed through CBS, and the creation of a recording studio, George Massenburg/ARC, also called "The Complex," in West Los Angeles. The year ended with the release of another hit single, entitled "September", which was added to the quintuple Platinum compilation album, The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1, released on November 23, 1978. At this time, Bobby Harris of the Dazz Band requested and got Philip Bailey to produce the group's first album, Kinsman Dazz. Bailey had major input into the group's vocal arrangements and would go on to co-produce the band's second album, Dazz.[46]
