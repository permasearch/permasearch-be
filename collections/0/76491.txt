In 610 CE, Muhammad began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations.[5] Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca.[6] In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad migrated to the city of Yathrib (Medina). With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community which was eventually resurrected leading to the First Fitna. The dispute would intensify greatly after the Battle of Karbala, in which Muhammad's grandson Hussein ibn Ali was killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph YazidÂ I, and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community.
