Led by guard Lawrence Moten and forward/center John Wallace, the school returned to the NCAAs in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, Wallace led the team to its third Final Four appearance, where it played impressively before losing, 76â€“67, in the final to a heavily favored Kentucky team that included nine future NBA players. (Kentucky head coach Rick Pitino had been an assistant coach to Boeheim in 1976, 1977.)[12]
