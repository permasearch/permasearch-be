Prior to January 15, 2013, rifles deemed assault-style did not have to be registered in any jurisdiction within New York except for NYC.[7][8] Since enactment of the NY SAFE Act, all grandfathered operable assault-style rifles purchased prior to January 15, 2013 must now be registered. The deadline to register these weapons was on or before January 14, 2014. NYC requires registration and has additional restrictions such as they cannot take a detachable magazine having a capacity greater than five rounds.[32] Laws pertaining to the handling of rifles are in sharp contrast to those of handguns. For example, licensed carry of a handgun on one's person allows the handgun to be fully loaded, including within an automobile, while visiting a place of business or while crossing a public road while hunting. A rifle or shotgun cannot be kept loaded in any of the above circumstances except for a self-defense emergency.[33] Antiques and replica handguns must be registered to be legally loaded and fired.[34]
