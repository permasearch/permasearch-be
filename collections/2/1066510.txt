An Enchanted Compass is a compass that is used to guide the person holding it to a desired location.[3] Hansel and Gretel has another type of compass which allows them to track and find their father. In Wonderland, Cyrus owns a separate Enchanted Compass that would guide him to his mother if he ever got lost.
