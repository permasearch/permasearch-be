The use of natural grass was long thought unfeasible since the stadium was designed as a closed structure with a roof that opens, and as such the interior was not intended or built to deal with weather, including low temperatures and drainage. As of the 2016 season, they are one of two teams to have never played a home game on grass at their main stadium (the Tampa Bay Rays played some home games in 2007 and 2008 at Champion Stadium in Walt Disney World).[46][47][48] However, the Blue Jays have long explored the possibility of converting the Rogers Centre to a natural grass surface, and plans are in place to install a grass field by 2018 to allow enough time for research and growing of the sod.[49] Installing grass would require digging up the floor, adding a drainage system, and installing 30 cm (1 ft) of dirt. The stadium would need to be permanently locked into its baseball configuration; the lower stands, which roll into position for football, would be permanently fixed in position for baseball.[50][51][52] The plan became more definite when Rogers renewed the Argonauts' lease through 2017, but ruled out any further extensions; in May 2015, it was announced the Argos would move to BMO Field for the 2016 season.[29][30][31] The Blue Jays subsequently confirmed the Argonauts' early departure would not accelerate their own plans to install grass in 2018,[53] though it did allow for a dirt infield to be installed for the 2016 season.[54] However, it does not appear likely the field will be converted to natural grass, as no further announcements for replacing the surface have been made since, and the field continues to retain its artificial surface.[55]
