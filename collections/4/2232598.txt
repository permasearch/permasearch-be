In September 2017, Cardi B's single "Bodak Yellow" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, making Cardi B the first female rapper to top the chart with a solo output since fellow American rapper Lauryn Hill's "Doo Wop (That Thing)", debuted atop the chart in 1998. Overall, it made Cardi B the fifth female rapper to ever lead the Hot 100.[97] Cardi B is also noted for being the first person of Dominican descent to reach number one in the history of the Hot 100, since it was launched in 1958.[98] In October, Cardi B broke another Billboard Hot 100 record, when "Bodak Yellow" stayed atop the charts for three consecutive weeks, tying with American pop singer Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do" as the longest running female at the number one spot on the charts in 2017.[99][100]
