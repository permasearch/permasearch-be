The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael heads to a shareholder meeting in New York, and brings Andy, Dwight, and Oscar with him. Michael is shocked when he and other higher members of the company are booed onstage and tries to improve the situation, but instead worsens it. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to get Ryan to do some work.
