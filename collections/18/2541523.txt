"Someday We'll Know" was slated as the album's second single,[16]  but the group disbanded before its official release, and the song was far less successful than its predecessor, charting in several European countries.[4][49][50] The song reached the top 40 in only one country, Brazil, where it peaked at number 38.[51] In the United States, the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, although it did manage to reach the Adult Top 40, where it spent 11 weeks and peaked at number 28.[35] In the United Kingdom, the song managed to enter the singles chart, but it peaked at number 48 and spent only two weeks in the top 100.[39] "Mother We Just Can't Get Enough" was planned to be the album's third single, but was never commercially released, due to the group's dissolution.[35][6][13]
