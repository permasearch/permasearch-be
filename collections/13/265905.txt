Cycling suffers from a perception that it is unsafe.[35][36] This perception is not always backed by hard numbers, because of under reporting of accidents and lack of bicycle use data (amount of cycling, kilometers cycled) which make it hard to assess the risk and monitor changes in risks.[37] In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking.[38] In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance.[39][40] However, in the UK for example the fatality and serious injury rates per hour of travel are just over double for cycling than those for walking.[38] Thus if a person is, for example, about to undertake a ten kilometre journey to a given destination it may on average be safer to undertake this journey by bicycle than on foot. However, if a person is intending, for example, to undertake an hour's exercise it is likely to be considerably more dangerous to take that exercise by cycling rather than by walking.
