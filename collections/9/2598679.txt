A person's signal telling them to accept is denoted as H (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is L (a low signal). The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an H, and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an L signal. This is essentially a conditional probability â€“ the probability of H when the correct action is to accept, or     P [ H  |  A ]   {\displaystyle P[H|A]}  . Similarly     P [ L  |  R ]   {\displaystyle P[L|R]}   is the probability that an agent gets an L signal when the correct action is reject. If these likelihoods are represented by q, then q > 0.5. This is summarized in the table below.[6]
