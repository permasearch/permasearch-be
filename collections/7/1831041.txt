While Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads had continued to rally crowds of opponents to appear at public hearings until it was apparent that their voice did not reflect the wishes of the majority of impacted Hoosiers,[60] other organized protestor group conducted acts of vandalism, ranging from spray-painting graffiti on the Indiana Statehouse in June 2005;[61] to attempted arson at the I-69 regional planning office in Bloomington in July 2005;[62] to the breaking of windows of a private pro-I-69 business in Evansville in June 2008.[63] In the case of the Statehouse incident, two-dozen protesters were arrested on charges from disorderly conduct due to an assault against a police officer. In addition to incidents in Indianapolis, numerous incidents have also occurred in and around the construction sites, while it was located in Gibson County. Especially active has been a group called Roadblock Earth First which has been responsible for a number of vandalism incidents in Oakland City and at a Haubstadt asphalt yard given the contract for the first segment.[31][32] In 2009, two protesters were arrested on charges of felony racketeering for disrupting public meetings in 2007 and 2008. These protests and acts of vandalism were widely viewed as an effort to intimidate proponents of I-69.[64]
