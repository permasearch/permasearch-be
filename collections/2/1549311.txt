After being exposed, Control calls in Hersh in her attempts to get either the Machine or Arthur Claypool's machine Samaritan. With the help of Root, the team escapes, but Hersh captures Root who is taken for torture by Control. Hersh then leads a SWAT team to the bank where Vigilance is trying to retrieve the Samaritan drives. When Peter Collier refuses to cooperate, Hersh and his team storm the bank, killing several Vigilance members before one blows himself up with a grenade, leaving Hersh's fate unknown. ("Alethia")
