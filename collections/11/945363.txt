The first intercollegiate game in the United States was played on November 22, 1877 between New York University and Manhattan College.[2] Lacrosse had been introduced in upstate New York in the 1860s. Lacrosse was further introduced to the Baltimore area in the 1890s. These two areas continue to be hotbeds of college lacrosse in the U.S. An organizing body for the sport, the U. S. National Amateur Lacrosse Association, was founded in 1879.[2] The first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held in 1881, with Harvard beating Princeton, 3â€“0, in the championship game.[3] New York University and Columbia University also participated.[2] In 1882 three colleges formed a league called the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA), which four other colleges soon joined.[2] From this point through 1931, collegiate lacrosse associations chose an annual champion based on season records.[2] In 1894, the Inter-University Lacrosse League (IULL) began play using slightly different rules.[4]
