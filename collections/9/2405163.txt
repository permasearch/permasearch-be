Many other high schools do not require community service hours for graduation, but still see an impressive number of students get involved in their community. For example, in Palo Alto, California, students at Palo Alto High School log about 45,000 hours of community service every year.[3] As a result, the school's College and Career Center awards about 250â€“300 students the President's Volunteer Service Award every year for their hard work.
