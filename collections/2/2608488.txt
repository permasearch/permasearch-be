The corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a space faring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking planets. The corrupted Klyntar force their hosts to perform death-defying feats in order to feed off of the resulting rushes of adrenaline, and other hormones, such as phenethylamine. These host beings would be sucked dry, exhausted by the constant stress and exertion, or simply die in a failed stunt.[4]
