Clapton received an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument was difficult to play and he briefly lost interest.[14] Two years later Clapton picked it up again and started playing consistently.[14] Clapton was influenced by the blues from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the chords of blues music by playing along to the records.[15] He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to them over and over until he felt he'd got it right.[15][16]
