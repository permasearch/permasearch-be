Flu vaccination may lead to side effects such as runny nose and sore throat, which can last for up to several days. Egg allergy may also be a concern, since flu vaccines are typically made using eggs;[57][58] however, research into egg-allergy and influenza vaccination[59] has led some advisory groups to recommend vaccine for those with mild allergies and monitored vaccination for those with more severe symptoms.[60] A large study of nearly 800 children in the UK with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine.[61][62] On January 17, 2013, the U.S. FDA approved Flublok, a faster-turnaround influenza vaccine which is the first grown in insect cells instead of eggs. Since eggs are not used in its production, it avoids any problem with egg allergies.[63]
