In August 2009, Jim returns for Steve's wedding to Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) along with Andy (Nicholas Cochrane), Steve's twin brother. When Becky is arrested and accused of dealing drugs, Jim finds out about Slug (Marshall Lancaster), the person who planted the drugs, and suggests to Steve that he give copies of Slug's photos to taxi businesses around Weatherfield, in the hope someone will recognise him and leaves again with Andy.
