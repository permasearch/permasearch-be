The El Rocco became a legend in Australian jazz history and in the 1980s a documentary movie Beyond The El Rocco was made about the club. Many of Sydney's top musicians worked there early in their careers including John Sangster, John Poch√©e, Don Burrows, George Golla, Alan Turnbull and Judy Bailey.
