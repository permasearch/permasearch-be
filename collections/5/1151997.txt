This Monty Python-esque spoof in which Welles plays all but one of the characters (including two characters in drag), was made around 1968-9.  Welles intended this completed sketch to be one of several items in a television special on London.  Other items filmed for this special – all included in the "One Man Band" documentary by his partner Oja Kodar — comprised a sketch on Winston Churchill (played in silhouette by Welles), a sketch on peers in a stately home, a feature on London gentlemen's clubs, and a sketch featuring Welles being mocked by his snide Savile Row tailor (played by Charles Gray).
