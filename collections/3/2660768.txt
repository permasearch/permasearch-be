Among the best-known halos is the 22째 halo, often just called "halo", which appears as a large ring around the Sun or Moon with a radius of about 22째 (roughly the width of an outstretched hand at arm's length). The ice crystals that cause the 22째 halo are oriented semi-randomly in the atmosphere, in contrast to the horizontal orientation required for some other halos such as sun dogs and light pillars. As a result of the optical properties of the ice crystals involved, no light is reflected towards the inside of the ring, leaving the sky noticeably darker than the sky around it, and giving it the impression of a "hole in the sky".[3] The 22째 halo is not to be confused with the corona, which is a different optical phenomenon caused by water droplets rather than ice crystals, and which has the appearance of a multicolored disk rather than a ring.
