During the breeding season, males that fail to secure territories and harems, most often subadults, will cause group raids in an attempt to change the status quo and gain access to the females.[17] Group raids are more common on sandy beaches than rocky ones.[17] These raids cause chaos in the breeding harems, often splitting mothers from their young. The resident males try to fight off the raiders and keep all the females in their territorial boundaries. Raiders are often unsuccessful in securing a female, but some are able to capture some females or even stay in the breeding area with one or more females.[17] Sometimes, an invading male abducts pups, possibly as an attempt to control the females.[17] They also take pups as substitutes for mature females.[18] Subadults herd their captured pups and prevent them from escaping, much like adult males do to females.[18] A pup may be mounted by its abductor, but intromission does not occur.[18] While abducting pups does not give males immediate reproductive benefits, these males may gain experience in controlling females.[18] Pups are sometimes severely injured or killed during abductions.[17][18]
