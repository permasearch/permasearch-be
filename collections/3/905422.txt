Delegates at the Party Congresses elected the members of the Central Committee.[106] Nevertheless, there were no competitions for the seats of the Central Committee. The Soviet leadership decided beforehand who would be elected, or rather appointed, to the Central Committee.[107] In the Brezhnev era, for instance, delegates at Party Congresses lost the power to vote in secret against candidates endorsed by the leadership.[107] For instance, at the congresses in 1962 and 1971 the delegates elected the Central Committee unanimously.[107] According to Robert Vincent Daniels the Central Committee was rather an assembly of representatives than an assembly of individuals.[108] The appointment of members often had "an automatic character"; members were appointed to represent various institutions.[108] While Jerry F. Hough agrees with Daniels analysis, he states that other factors must be included; for example an official with a bad relationship with the General Secretary would not be appointed to the Central Committee.[108]
