The Ministry of National Education is responsible for pre-tertiary education.[401] This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, middle school and high school.[402] Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent.[403] Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low performers.[404] Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study.[402] Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old.[404] The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.[405]
