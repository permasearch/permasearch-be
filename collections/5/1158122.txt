Junction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the Astrodome to Minute Maid Park.  The new stadium was originally called "The Ballpark at Union Station" because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston.  In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer.  The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees.
