VAT is levied on most goods and services provided by registered businesses in the UK and some goods and services imported from outside the European Union.[3] There are complex regulations for goods and services imported from within the EU. The default VAT rate is the standard rate, 20% since 4 January 2011. Some goods and services are subject to VAT at a reduced rate of 5% (such as domestic fuel) or 0% (such as most food and children's clothing).[4] Others are exempt from VAT or outside the system altogether.
