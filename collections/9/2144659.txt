After the elections, the Governor S. S. Sidhu invited the INC-led Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) under the leadership of D. D. Lapang to form the Government by virtue of being the largest party in the Assembly. The MPA claimed that this move by the Governor was unconstitutional since the MUA did not have sufficient majority in the Assembly. The MUA was given 10 days to prove its majority in the Assembly. As the confidence vote approached, D. D. Lapang resigned and the MPA was given the chance to form the Government.[1]
