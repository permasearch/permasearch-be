In the animated series Phineas and Ferb, the title characters own a pet platypus, named Perry the Platypus, who unknown to them, is a secret agent. The choice of a platypus was inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance.[94] As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics.[95][96]
