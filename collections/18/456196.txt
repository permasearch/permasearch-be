The XU40 was initially produced exclusively at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, Japan for all global markets beginning in May 2007.[19][4][12][20] Production in China for local sales was started on 25 May 2009 by GAC Toyota in Nansha District, Guangzhou, Guangdong.[21] Toyota had intended on building the Highlander in Blue Springs, Mississippi for the North American market in the 2011 model year.[22] However, the Corolla was built there instead, and the Highlander is being built at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton, Indiana, from the 2010 model year onward for a majority of North America, replacing Tundra production.[23] TMMI Highlander production began in October 2009 for gasoline engine models only; hybrids continued to be imported from Japan until the release of the third generation XU50, where all production except for China was consolidated at TMMI.
