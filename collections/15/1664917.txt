New York City has many forms of semi-formal and informal public transportation, including "dollar vans", or "jitneys". Dollar vans serve major areas in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx that lack adequate subway service. In 2006, the New York City Council began debate on greater industry regulation, including requiring all dollar vans to be painted in a specific color to make them easier to recognize, similar to the public light buses in Hong Kong.[91] The vans pick up and drop off anywhere along a route, and payment is made at the end of a trip.
