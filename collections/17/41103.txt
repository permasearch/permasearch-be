Regardless of what time they entered the straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not planning to flee after all, the Allies would have been able to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.[56] According to Herodotus, this was dawn, and as the Allies "were putting out to sea the barbarians immediately attacked them".[56][112] If the Persians only entered the straits at dawn, then the Allies would have had the time to take up their station in a more orderly fashion.[108]
