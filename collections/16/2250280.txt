The CSRA was one of the largest reforms in Federal personnel regulations since the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and is one of the Carter Administration's major domestic achievements. However, the long lasting effects and the legacy of the CSRA are widely disputed. Some claim that the CSRA has accomplished virtually nothing. Others claim that the CSRA has accomplished quite a bit. On one side of the argument, it is claimed that the CSRA has not affected unequal hiring methods, has not formed a division of experienced administrators that it was supposed to, and has been ignored by certain agencies.[8] Others claim that the CSRA was a pervasive attempt to reform and restrain a large government bureaucracy in the United States.[9] On the other side of the argument, it is claimed that many provisions in the CSRA have spread globally and that the CSRA has had a serious impact on public administration systems all over the world.[10] It is also claimed that the CSRA has incorporated â€œlong-lasting strategies based on improved responsiveness and competitiveness of federal employees" and that the CSRA has moderately improved employee attitudes in the workplace.[11]
