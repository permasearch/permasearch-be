There is an intense rivalry between Victoria and Western Australia.[47] Western Australia's rivalry likewise stemmed from the feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave their state the credit it deserved, despite some of the best players of all time coming from the state.[48] Some games widely regarded as some of the best in the history of Australian football were played between Victoria and Western Australia in the 1980s.[49] Shane Parker a former Western Australia player, said of the rivalry "When I was a kid, the State of Origin games were the greatest ever. It was a really big thing to see the WA side play, particularly against Victoria".[50]
