Hordley explained that the couple can't see they are made for each other as they are "so busy competing and getting one up on each other" which means that they fail to see that they are "the same".[9] Atkins said Charity asked Cain to marry her to "prove a point".[9] On a storyline in which Cain and Charity plan to carry out a scam Atkins said it would make the audience question "will they/won't they pull it off" before adding that it is a "Bonnie and Clyde storyline but without the deaths!"[9] Hordley said he and Atkins "spark off and bounce off" each other which Hordley added made it "easier for me to act with her". Atkins added that she felt "having a good rapport in that way both on and off screen is vital".[10] Digital Spy described the relationship as "volatile".[10]
