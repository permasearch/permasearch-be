The bill aimed at providing social security and livelihood rights to street vendors, has its origins in the 'Street Vendors Policy' introduced in 2004, which was later revised as 'National Policy on Urban Street Vendors, 2009. Also in the same year, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation circulated a draft of bill titled, 'Model Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Bill, 2009', between all States and Union Territory governments for creation of state legislation, however it had no legal bindings, thus few governments made any progress in this regard. Eventually in 2010, the Supreme Court of India, which has  recognized street vending as a source of livelihood, directed the ministry to work out on a central legislation,[9] and a draft of same was unveiled to the public on November 11, 2011. The key point of the draft bill were, protection legitimate street vendors from harassment by police and civic authorities, and demarcation of "vending zones" on the basis of "traditional natural markets", proper representation of vendors and women in decision making bodies, and establishment of effective grievance redressal and dispute resolution mechanism.[11]
