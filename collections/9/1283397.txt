The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade.[22] Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade.[24] Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.[24]
