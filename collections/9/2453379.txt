The current Code of Canon Law, which came into force in 1983, maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows,[10] but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects, including the distinction between "orders" and "congregations". It has accordingly dropped the language of the 1917 code and uses the single term "religious institute" (which appears nowhere in the 1917 Code)[11] to designate all such institutes of consecrated life alike.[12]
