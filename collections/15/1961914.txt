In software architecture, the structure of software is the way in which it is partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one component without requiring changes in others.[21]:3 The structure can be represented in diagrams such as the Control Structure Diagram and the Nassiâ€“Shneiderman diagram.[22] Structural elements reflect the requirements of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance, then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has backups.[23] A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several systems in the Space Shuttle.[24]
