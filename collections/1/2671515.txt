When Rory is unexpectedly accepted to Chilton Preparatory School (from a waiting list), Lorelai is unable to come up with the tuition due immediately, Lorelai turns to her parents for help. They agree to it, if only the girls will attend dinner every Friday night and allow them into their lives. Later, Lorelai and her best friend Sookie St. James find an old run-down inn called the Dragonfly Inn. When its owner dies, they decide to purchase it. However, the Independence Inn is in a point of crisis due to a recent fire, causing the pair to question the timing of their new endeavor. Furthermore, Rory, by this time, has been accepted to Yale, and has been denied financial aid due to Lorelai receiving a one-time investment payout given to her by her father (see below). Lorelai is ready to divert her money for the purchase and renovation costs to Rory's tuition, but Rory independently turns to her grandparents for help with the tuition, allowing Lorelai and Sookie to purchase The Dragonfly Inn.
