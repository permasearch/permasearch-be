On Morgana's birthday, Arthur gifts her with a dagger. Merlin suspects she is going to use it to kill Uther, and follows her when she is really going to meet Morgause. Merlin accidentally causes Morgana to fall down the stairs. While she lays dying under the physician's care, Uther reveals to Gaius that Morgana is his daughter and Morgana hears this. When she recovers she immediately tells Morgause, and Morgause recognizes that Morgana has a claim to the throne of Camelot, although Morgana wants to kill Uther in revenge for his deception.
