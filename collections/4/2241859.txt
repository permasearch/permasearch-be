for every pair of players i and j. Intuitively, player i has more bargaining power than player j with respect to imputation x if      s  i j   v   ( x ) >  s  j i   v   ( x )   {\displaystyle s_{ij}^{v}(x)>s_{ji}^{v}(x)}  , but player j is immune to player i's threats if      x  j   = v ( j )   {\displaystyle x_{j}=v(j)}  , because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all imputations where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in (Davis & Maschler 1965).
