U.S. 1 then intersects I-95 one last time on a cloverleaf interchange on exit 354A; the two highways will not meet again until Virginia. U.S. 1 continues west, with the parkway ending with an intersection of U.S. Route 23, which US 1 shares a concurrency with from here to the Georgia state line. The road continues northwest, intersecting State Road 111, and crossing the Ribault River just north of that intersection. US 1 then intersects State Road 115A. Just south of the I-295 West Beltway, it passes west of the Little Trout River. It then has an interchange with the I-295 West Beltway, followed by an intersection with Trout River Boulevard. US 1 then crosses the Trout River, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and intersects State Road 104 immediately north of the river. The road then heads towards the Thomas Creek Conversation Area, leaving Duval County at the Thomas Creek Bridge.
