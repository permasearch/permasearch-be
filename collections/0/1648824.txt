Tony meets with Vinnie's older brother, Carlos (Danny Trejo), who Charlie works for. However, Tony is ordered to kill Charlie upon hearing he spoke with Ray, luring Charlie out of his house to kill him while Joey kills his wife, the latter murder which leads back to Ray because of his pocket knife. On the run, with the help of Jenny, Ray discovers Tony was involved in killing the shooters. Confronting Carlos with the development, it becomes known Tony's wife Priscilla is aiding his agenda by sleeping around with Carlos and distracting him so that Tony can take over his brother Vinnie's strip club. Offended, Priscilla shoots Carlos dead, but Ray avoids a bullet and shoots her dead.
