The video, shot entirely in black and white, opens with Money alone with a metal ladder and a folding chair on an otherwise empty stage (at Lawlor Events Center in Reno, Nevada). He performs to an absent audience, and Ronnie Spector is seen in a make-up room during cutaways. Spector's face isn't completely revealed until about three-quarters of the way through the video, when she joins Money on the stage.
