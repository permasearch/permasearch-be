Starting in December, many homes, businesses and other buildings are decorated with poinsettias, which are called "noche buena" (from the Spanish phrase that means "good night" referring to Christmas Eve) .[1] Mexico is the origin of the poinsettia. In the pre-Hispanic period, they were called cuetlaxochitl, and a favorite in the mid winter when they were a symbol of the new life that they believed that fallen warriors received, returning as hummingbirds and butterflies to drink the nectar.[4] A modern Mexican legend says that the poinsettia was once a weed that miraculously turned into a beautiful flower so that a child could present it to the infant Jesus.[5] The name for this plant is also used to refer to a dark bock-style beer which is only available during the Christmas season.[1][6]
