Additional voice actors include Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir,[8] John Mulaney as Spider-Ham,[9] and Kimiko Glenn as Peni Parker.[9] Cage based his character on the films of Humphrey Bogart, wanting the character to sound similar to actors from that era such as James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson.[10]
