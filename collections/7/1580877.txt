Over the years, NS Power has been blamed by Nova Scotia residents for its poor maintenance record and its failure to quickly reconnect customers after storms.[73] In September 2003, 700,000 Nova Scotia residents were without power for up to two weeks after the passage of Hurricane Juan.[74] The Category 2 storm damaged 27 main transmission lines, several transmission towers, 117 distribution feeders, and 31 major electrical substations.[75] More recently, the issue of the company's investment in the provincial grid has been raised at a leaders' debate during the 2009 election campaign.[76] The company received praise from premier Darrell Dexter for its efforts in restoring power after the passage of Hurricane Earl in September 2010.[77]
