Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson), born 1961, is George's mother. Described by George as a Virgo and a career legal secretary who enjoys ice skating and John Grisham novels. She is organized, neurotic, and a bit foul-mouthed. She hates the word "moist" because she thinks it sounds pornographic and is afraid of balloons. Her name is an ironic misnomer, as her life is "joyless". Indeed, Joy's profound general dissatisfaction and frustration is summed in George's observation, "Who had the nerve to name you 'Joy'?"
