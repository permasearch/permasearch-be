Gandhi remained a staunch supporter of Palestinians in the Arabâ€“Israeli conflict and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States.[111] Israel was viewed as a religious state and thus an analogue to India's archrival Pakistan. Indian diplomats also hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in Kashmir. Nevertheless, Gandhi authorized the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. Her lieutenant, P. V. Narasimha Rao, later became Prime Minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.[118]
