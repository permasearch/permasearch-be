Season One begins with the Sons of Anarchy (SOA) finding their weapon storage warehouse being burned down. The SOA rush to the scene, where local police officers are already investigating. Jax and Clay talk to Sheriff Vic Trammel about the blaze, who claims that propane tanks inside the building blew up, and that he suspects arson, due to the bootprints inside. Trammel then shows them the burned corpses of the people hidden beneath the building, who were illegal immigrants. It is later revealed they were Mexican prostitutes "owned" by the club's Sergeant-at-Arms, Tig Trager. When Jax returns home and begins looking through storage, he finds old photographs of his late father and a journal titled The Life and Death of Sam Crow: How the Sons of Anarchy Lost Their Way written by him, and for his sons Jackson and Thomas (who had already died at the time of writing). Jax is then called away to a group meeting ("Church") where all chapter members meet. These are: Clay Morrow (President), Bobby Munson (Treasurer), Tig Trager (Sergeant-at-Arms), Chibs Telford (Medic), Piney Winston (Co-founder), Juice Ortiz (intelligence officer) and Happy. Clay announces that Juice has located the guns and that they were stolen by the Mayans, a rival motorcycle gang. They decide to get some payback the next day, despite Jax's suggesting that the club look into other ways of earning money instead of dealing weapons, especially with so many rival groups on their back.
