The 2002 ABKCO reissues of the song—including on reissued albums and a new compilation, Forty Licks—have a remastering error; a vocal overdub is missing in the chorus. This was subsequently remedied, and the versions on 2007's Rolled Gold+, 2012's GRRR!, and the 2013 iTunes remasters contain the overdub.
