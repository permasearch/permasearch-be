The Miami Conservancy District began construction of its flood control system in 1918. Since 1922, when the project was completed at a cost in excess of $32 million, it has prevented Dayton from any flood as severe as that of 1913.[8][23] Since its completion, the Miami Conservancy District has protected the Dayton area from flooding more than 1,500 times.[27] Ongoing expenses for maintaining the district comes from property tax assessments collected annually from all property holders in the district. Properties closer to the river channel and the natural flood plain pay more than properties further away.[28]
