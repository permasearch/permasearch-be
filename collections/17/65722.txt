As Advanced Warfare continued to move along, a deal was struck upon between FaZe and Denial Esports. FaZe reportedly found that Huke and Slasher were unsettled at FaZe and were seeking other teams. As a result, the organization and key members, ZooMaa and Enable, traded Huke and Slasher for Denial COD Champions James "Clayster" Eubanks and Dillon "Attach" Price.[135] The deal established FaZe as a top three team, and the new squad made strong showings in the Pro League, as well as multiple LAN wins, their first of which being the UMG Dallas 2015 event, where they beat OpTic 3-0.[136] Soon after, the squad traveled to Europe to try and win the Gfinity Summer Championship 2015. FaZe ran through the tournament with ease and were pitted, once again, against OpTic gaming in the finals. OpTic picked up a 3-0 lead in the best of seven; however, FaZe completed the near impossible yet again and made the 4-3 comeback to win the LAN event.[136][137] Doubts resurfaced about the FaZe team after a poor showing at UMG Washington DC 2015, but they didn't continue for long after they won MLG Pro League CoD AW Season 3 Playoffs.[138] At the MLG World Finals 2015, FaZe would finish pool play with a 4-0 record, placing them against Elevate, who they lost to 4-1, sending FaZe down to the losers bracket. Where they won the matches 3-2 and 3-1 respectively. FaZe then played against Denial eSports, where they would fall 3-1, placing 5th-6th at the event.
