The 1878 Act said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1 lb = 6999453592650000000♠453.59265 g or 0.45359 kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about 6999999999400419481♠2.2046213 lb. In 1883, it was determined jointly by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade and the Bureau International that 6999453592427700000♠0.4535924277 kg was a better approximation, and this figure, rounded to 6999453592430000000♠0.45359243 kg was given legal status by an Order in Council in May 1898.[21]
