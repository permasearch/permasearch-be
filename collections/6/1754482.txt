The UNIX-HATERS Handbook covers some of these design features as failures from the user point of view. However, although some information is quite dated and cannot be applied to modern Unixes such as Linux, Eric S. Raymond discovered that several issues are still prevailing, while others were resolved. Raymond concludes that not all concepts behind Unix can be deemed as non-functional even though the book's intention may have been to portray Unix as inferior without encouraging discussions with developers to actually fix the issues.[2]
