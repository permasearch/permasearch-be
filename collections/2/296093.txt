The best known German playwright was Andreas Gryphius, who used the Jesuit model of the Dutch Joost van den Vondel and Pierre Corneille. There was also Johannes Velten who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the commedia del'arte  with the classic theatre of Corneille and Moli√®re. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.
