Normally after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time.[11] This is due in part from the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.[11] In epilepsy the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased.[11] This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly.[11] This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a "seizure focus".[11] Following an injury to the brain, another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up regulation of excitatory circuits or down regulation of inhibitory circuits.[11][33] These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis.[11][33] Failure of the bloodâ€“brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism.[34]
