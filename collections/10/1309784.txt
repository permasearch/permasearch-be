Nuttli resolved this by measuring the amplitude of short-period (~1 sec.) Lg waves,[34] a complex form of the Love wave which, although a surface wave, he found provided a result more closely related the mb scale than the Ms scale.[35] Lg waves attenuate quickly along any oceanic path, but propagate well through the granitic continental crust, and MbLg is often used in areas of stable continental crust; it is especially useful for detecting underground nuclear explosions.[36]
