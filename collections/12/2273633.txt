Porcupine quills have recently inspired a new type of hypodermic needle. Due to backward-facing barbs on the quills, when used as needles, they are particularly good at two things â€“ penetrating the skin and remaining in place.[21] The presence of barbs acting like anchors makes it more painful to remove a quill that has pierced the skin of a predator.[14]
