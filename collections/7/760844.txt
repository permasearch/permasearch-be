The state estimator is an integral part of the overall monitoring and control systems for transmission networks.  It is mainly aimed at providing a reliable estimate of the system voltages. This information from the state estimator flows to control centers and database servers across the network.[1] The variables of interest are indicative of parameters like margins to operating limits, health of equipment and required operator action.  State estimators allow the calculation of these variables of interest with high confidence despite the facts that the measurements may be corrupted by noise, or could be missing or inaccurate.
