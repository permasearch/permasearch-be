Myostatin is expressed at very low levels in cardiac myocytes.[24][25] Although its presence has been noted in cardiomyocytes of both fetal and adult mice,[26] its physiological function remains uncertain.[25] However, it has been suggested that fetal cardiac myostatin may play a role in early heart development.[26]
