Most commercial health insurances and Medicaid have a hospice benefit as well.[46] These typically are similar to the Medicare benefit. There may be a co-pay required by commercial health insurance providers depending on individual plans.[47] According to a 2008 article by Lauren Tara LaCapra on TheStreet.com, Medicare and Medicaid paid 78% of home-based hospice charges in 2008, with 12% being supplied by private insurance providers and 10% "out of pocket", paid by the patient.[48] Most non-profit hospice agencies have contingencies for patients who lack insurance coverage and will provide care to the patient free of charge or at reduced rates.[46] LaCapra said that out-of-pocket expenses for home-based hospice services were $758 a year in 2008 for the average hospice patient.[48]
