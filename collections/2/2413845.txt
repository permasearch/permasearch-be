On the roof of the building is a large LED message board that measures 360 feet (110 m) by 90 feet (27 m), described as the "largest LED roof sign on the planet" by Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. The sign was approved by the Cleveland City Planning Commission in March 2016 with the stipulation that only the arena's name or its naming rights sponsor can be shown. Any other use of the sign needs commission approval. The message board was installed later in 2016 and debuted in May during Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.[15][16]
