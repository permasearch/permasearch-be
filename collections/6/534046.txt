The band enjoyed extensive success in 1997 with their first album, Third Eye Blind, which eventually went platinum six times.[2] The band maintained popularity into 1998 through extensive touring and a number of singles that performed well in the charts, including "Semi-Charmed Life," "How's It Going to Be," "Graduate," "Losing a Whole Year," and "Jumper," but by the end of the year, the band looked to start working on new material.[2]
