In July 2017, two New York City police officers were refused service by an employee at Dunkin' Donuts after the employee told the police "I don't serve cops".[38] Police officers boycotted the chain because of the incident and lack of apology from Dunkin' Donuts at the time.[39] Though the company issued an apology, many considered it weak and some non-police customers joined the boycott, also leaving angry messages on the company's social media pages.[40]
