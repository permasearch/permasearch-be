The Bills were frequently mentioned as a team that could move to Toronto due in part to Buffalo's proximity to the city.[151] Niagara Falls, New York, located between the two cities, was also considered as a compromise location.[181] The Bills play in one of the league's smallest markets,[182] and their games are often blacked out due to not being sold out,[182][183][184] even with only 7 home games to sell during the Bills in Toronto series. The difficulties selling tickets, particularly late in the season when the weather is much poorer, was part of the reason why capacity of the team's home, Ralph Wilson Stadium, was decreased by 7,000 during its 1998 renovation.[185] Western New York's economic difficulties have forced the Bills to keep their average ticket prices among the lowest in the NFL,[186][187] and the team did not opt into the loosening of blackout restrictions in 2012.[188]
