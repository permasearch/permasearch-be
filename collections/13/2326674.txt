In the episode "Outcry", John Schuck played the NYPD's Chief of Detectives which became a recurring part. The episodes "Weak", "Contagious" and "Identity" starred Mary Stuart Masterson as Dr. Rebecca Hendrix, a psychiatrist and former cop. This gave Masterson what has been called her best known role.[6] After confirming that Hendrix was needed while BD Wong was acting in theatre, Neal Baer stated that the character also gave him an opportunity to introduce a conflict between Benson and Stabler and said "Stabler hasn't always felt warmly toward psychiatry, but he does warm up to this character - who has been both a cop and a shrink."[7] The character Dr. Amy Solwey from the fifth season returned in the episode "Parts". Played by Marlee Matlin, Neal Baer said "Munch got very involved with her character, and we thought, Wow, that's really movingâ€š let's bring her back."[8]
