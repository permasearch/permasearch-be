Despite their concordant nature, many large sills change stratigraphic level within the intruded sequence, with each concordant part of the intrusion linked by relatively short dike-like segments. Such sills are known as transgressive, examples include the Whin Sill and sills within the Karoo basin.[3][4] The geometry of large sill complexes in sedimentary basins has become clearer with the availability of 3D seismic reflection data.[5] Such data has shown that many sills have an overall saucer shape and that many others are at least in part transgressive.[6]
