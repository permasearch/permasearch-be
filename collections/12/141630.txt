Now that war with Britain was over, the United States could concentrate on pressing matters in the Mediterranean, at Algiers. As had occurred during the First Barbary War American merchant ships and crews were once again being seized and held for large ransoms. On February 23, 1815, President Madison urged Congress to declare war. Congress approved the act but did not declare war against Algiers.[152] Madison had chosen Benjamin Williams Crowninshield as the new Secretary of the Navy, replacing William Jones.[153]
