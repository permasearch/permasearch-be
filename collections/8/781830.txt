On October 27, Iskander Mirza resigned from the presidency, transferring it to Ayub Khan.[4] Both men saw the other as a rival to their respective positions. Mirza believed his own position had become largely redundant after Ayub Khan assumed most executive powers as chief martial law administrator and prime minister, and acted to assert himself, while Ayub Khan thought Mirza was conspiring against him.[4][5] It is widely held that Ayub Khan and generals loyal to him forced Mirza to resign.[4][5] Mirza was later taken to Quetta, the capital of the province of Baluchistan, before being exiled on November 27 to London, England, where he resided until his death in 1969.[5]
