Pontoon is the British or domestic version of black jack, which in turn is the American version of vingt-et-un (French for twenty-one), a French gambling game popular at the court of Louis XV and later, much favoured by Napoleon, especially at St. Helena.[4] In the twentieth century it became the most popular game of the armed forces of English-speaking nations.[4] Pontoon, unlike casino Blackjack, has no official rules and varies widely from school to school.
