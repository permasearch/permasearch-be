New Zealand's 3–1 series win over the Lions in 1959 proved to be the start of a dominant period in All Black rugby.[53] This was followed by the 1963–64 tour to Britain and Ireland, led by Wilson Whineray, in which New Zealand were deprived of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland.[54] The only loss on this tour was to Newport RFC, who won 3–0 at Rodney Parade, Newport on 30 October 1963.[55] The 1967 side won three tests against the home nations, but was unable to play Ireland because of a foot-and-mouth scare.[54] This tour formed part of New Zealand's longest winning streak, between 1965 and 1970, of 17 test victories.[56] This was also the longest test winning streak by any nation at the time; it would be equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and surpassed by Lithuania in 2010.[57][i] Although the 1966 Lions were defeated 0–4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune five years later when the 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman John Dawes, beat New Zealand in a test series, which remains the Lions' only series victory in New Zealand.
