Here        r →    ( t )   {\displaystyle {\vec {r}}(t)}   is the trajectory (path) between the two points. The value of the integral (D) represents the length of this trajectory. The distance is the minimal value of this integral and is obtained when     r =  r  ∗     {\displaystyle r=r^{*}}   where      r  ∗     {\displaystyle r^{*}}   is the optimal trajectory. In the familiar Euclidean case (the above integral) this optimal trajectory is simply a straight line. It is well known that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. Straight lines can formally be obtained by solving the Euler–Lagrange equations for the above functional. In non-Euclidean manifolds (curved spaces) where the nature of the space is represented by a metric tensor      g  a b     {\displaystyle g_{ab}}   the integrand has to be modified to        g  a c       r ˙     c    g  a b       r ˙     b       {\displaystyle {\sqrt {g^{ac}{\dot {r}}_{c}g_{ab}{\dot {r}}^{b}}}}  , where Einstein summation convention has been used.
