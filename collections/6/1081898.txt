The Bingham Canyon ore deposits occur in the Bingham nappe.  They are a porphyry copper deposit, formed by a quartz monzonite porphyry intruded into sedimentary rocks.  They exhibit a concentric alteration pattern and mineralogic zonation around the Bingham stock.  These zones include a central core containing magnetite, followed by "a molybdenite zone low in copper, a bornite-chalcopyrite-gold higher grade copper zone, a pyrite-chalcopyrite zone, a pyrite zone, and an outermost lead-zinc zone."[10]:E1,E8
