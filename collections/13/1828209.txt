The next-oldest confirmed civilization is in the far south of the valley and is called Cuicuilco.[15] This archaeological site is located where Avenida Insurgentes Sur crosses the Anillo Periférico in the Tlalpan borough of the city. The old settlement once extended far beyond the boundaries of the current site, but it is buried under lava from one of the volcanic eruptions that led to its demise, and much of the modern city is built over this lava. The settlement was located where an old river delta used to form in the valley with waters from Mount Zacatépetl located in what is now the Tlalpan Forest. Cuicuilco was believed to have reached city status by 1200 BCE and began to decline around 100 BC–150 CE. However, even though the ceremonial pyramid was abandoned, the site remained a location to leave offerings up to 400 CE, although lava from the nearby Xitle volcano completely covered it.[15]
