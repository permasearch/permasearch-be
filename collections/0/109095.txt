The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[240] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[241] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[242] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[243]
