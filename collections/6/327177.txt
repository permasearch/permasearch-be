Curry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, where he is considered to be the "face of their footwear line".[216] Originally signed to Nike, Curry joined with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason.[217] As Curry became MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of his shoes have become a major factor for the brand, with stock prices rising and falling based on the success of the Curry shoe line.[218][219]
