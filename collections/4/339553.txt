Injection of fluid into subsurface geological structures, such as faults and fractures, reduces the effective normal stress acting across these structures. If sufficient shear stress is present, the structure may slip in shear and generate seismic events over a range of magnitudes; natural gas drilling may have caused earthquakes in North Texas.[120] Reports of minor tremors of no greater than 2.8 on the Richter scale were reported on June 2, 2009, in Cleburne, Texas, the first in the town's 140-year history.[121]
