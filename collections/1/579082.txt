Wizard rock (sometimes shorthanded as Wrock) is a musical movement dating from 2000 in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally[112][113] and has expanded to at least 750 bands.[114] Wrock bands mostly consist of young musicians that write and perform songs about the Harry Potter universe,[115][116] and these songs are often written from the point of view of a particular character in the books, usually the character who features in the band's name. If they are performing live, they may also cosplay, or dress as, that character.[117]
