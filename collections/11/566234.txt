The filming budget of Easy Rider was $360,000 to $400,000.[1] Peter Fonda said that on top this, he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew, saying, "Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels, the food, the gas, everything with Diner's Club".[12] Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million, "about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film" was spent licensing music that was added during the editing.[13]
