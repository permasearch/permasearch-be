England and Wales allow applications for early release on compassionate grounds for prisoners serving determinate or indeterminate sentences.[40] Three general principles are applied during the decision-making process: the safety of the public, new information not available to the court, and whether there was a specific purpose for the early release. [41] The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 s10 provides that the Secretary of State may at any time release a prisoner if they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisonerâ€™s release on compassionate grounds. [42] Compassionate release will be considered where the prisoner is terminally ill, bedridden or severely incapacitated. Where terminal illness is the case, no specific timescale is strictly followed, however a life expectancy of three months or less is suggested. [43]
