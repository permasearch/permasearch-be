New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, has recognised domestic partnerships since July 2010. The Relationships Register Act 2010 was introduced to the NSW Legislative Assembly on 23 April 2010, to provide conclusive proof of the existence of the relationship, thereby gaining all of the rights afforded to de facto couples under state and federal law. The bill was approved by the NSW Legislative Assembly on a 62–9 vote on 11 May 2010, and then by the NSW Legislative Council (upper house) on a 32–5 vote on 12 May. It was signed into law by Governor Marie Bashir and entered into force on 1 July 2010.[38][39] Earlier, in June 2008, the Legislative Assembly passed the Miscellaneous Acts Amendment (Same Sex Relationships) Bill 2008,[40][41] which recognises co-mothers as legal parents of children born through donor insemination, provides birth certificates allowing two mothers to be recognised, creates amendments to 57 pieces of state legislation to ensure de facto couples, including same-sex couples, are treated equally with married couples, and creates amendments to the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act to ensure same-sex couples are protected from discrimination on the basis of their "marital or domestic status" in employment, accommodation and access to other goods and services.[42] In November 2013, a bill was introduced to the New South Wales Legislative Council to legalise same-sex marriage. The bill was defeated.[43][44] The external territory of Norfolk Island has, since 1 July 2016, been incorporated into New South Wales legislation.
