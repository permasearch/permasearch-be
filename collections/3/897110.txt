According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[28] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000â€“17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska).[29] Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[30][31]
