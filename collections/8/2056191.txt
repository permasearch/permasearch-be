Without school to attend, Grant rejoined the Pender Troupe, and accepted a salary of 10 shillings a week from Pender.[44] The group began touring the county, and Grant developed the ability in pantomime to broaden his physical acting skills.[42] On July 21, 1920, at the age of 16, Grant travelled with the group on the RMS Olympic to conduct a tour of the United States, arriving a week later.[45] Biographer Richard Schickel claims that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were aboard the same ship, returning from their honeymoon, and that Grant played shuffleboard with him. He was so impressed with Fairbanks that the actor became an important role model.[46] After arriving in New York, the group performed at the New York Hippodrome—the largest theatre in the world at the time with a capacity of 5,697[45]—for nine months, putting on twelve shows a week;[42] their production of Good Times was successful.[45]
