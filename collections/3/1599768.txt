In May 2013, Ted discusses his move to Chicago with Marshall and Lily at Barney and Robin's wedding reception. Meanwhile, Barney recognizes the bass player as the woman—already introduced in previous episodes as the Mother (Cristin Milioti)—who advised him to pursue Robin. When he hears she's single, he suddenly realises what this means, and approaches Ted with the intent to introduce her to him, who declines the idea as he has to leave in order to get ready to move the next day. Outside, the group sadly bids Ted farewell, and he does a final high-five with Barney. Later, Ted goes to the Farhampton train station; however, his train is late. He tells an elderly lady about his weekend and she asks many questions about destiny. She looks up and spots the Mother standing nearby, but Ted insists he can't talk to her because he's moving. The next night, Marshall and Lily are surprised to see Ted sitting at their table in MacLaren's. Ted justifies this by telling them that he met a girl, which they approve after finding out she is the bass player from the wedding. At first, Marshall thinks it is crazy, but Lily assures him, saying she thinks its meant to be.
