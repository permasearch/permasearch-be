About Angoori's catchphrase "Sahi Pakde Hai", director Shashank Bali recalled that they came up with the idea after the first day of the shoot, when the show's writer and his close friend Manoj Santoshi called him and asked him if they can give Angoori a catchphrase, for whenever her English would go wrong, she would say that. He further told that the way Santoshi said ‘Sahi Pakde Hai’ excited him very much. The next day, they both met Shinde and requested her to get familiar with the dialogue and after that, Shinde did it effortlessly and it became a mainstay of the show.[20]
