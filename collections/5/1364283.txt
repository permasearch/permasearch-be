Although Canning said that the announcement of Kurt as prom queen "effectively caught [him] off guard, right in the gut, as good TV should", others were critical of the story at that moment, including Brown, who said that there was no logic to Kurt's victory, no explanation of how it might have happened, and no sense in Figgins acceding to it.[25][26] Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question.[27][28] The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths.[25][26] Poniewozik said it led to the episode's "theme of communityâ€”that is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what they have in common. Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night."[30] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion."[28]
