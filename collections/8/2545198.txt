In the 1980s, editors at DC Comics felt that its characters and their history had become convoluted and confusing to casual readers.[35] In 1985, DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rewrote the history of the DC Universe.[36] DC had been planning to revamp Superman for some time,[37] and Crisis gave the company freedom to reset the character from the very beginning.[38]
