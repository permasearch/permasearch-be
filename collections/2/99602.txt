The duo met at Belmont University in 2008 through a campus worship group, and following graduation, decided to give themselves two years to succeed as a country duo. They moved in with one another and began several odd jobs to pay bills, while playing clubs on the weekends.[8][10] While independent, they recorded and digitally distributed their first EP, Anything Like Me (2010).[8] They were discovered by Nickelback producer Joey Moi at a county fair, and the three began entering the studio together.[9] Unlike typical country music sessions, the group spent days polishing songs, which were collected on the duo's second EP, It'z Just What We Do (2012). In terms of production, the band modeled their sound on bands such as Nickelback, Shinedown, and Three Days Grace, while Moi aimed for each song to resemble hair metal group Def Leppard in structure.[9] Major labels became interested when the song "Cruise" first aired on satellite radio on "The Highway" channel and began selling well on iTunes, leading to a deal with Republic Nashville and Big Machine Label Group.[9]
