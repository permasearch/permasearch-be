Jerry Reed wrote by 1955, and he and Johnny Cash each recorded, his If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek(s) Don't Rise; the recordings of each of them use, at the same point within different verses, different phrases ("...creek stays down", "... creek stay low", "... creeks don't rise") that accommodate different rhymings, and at least three additional artists have recorded what are frank variations of that song.
