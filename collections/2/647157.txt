Alice sees a vehicle pull up and rushes outside, thinking it is Steve. Instead, she is greeted by a middle-aged woman named Mrs. Voorhees, who claims to be an old friend of Steve's. As Alice brings her inside, Mrs. Voorhees reveals that her son Jason was the boy who drowned in 1957. She blames his death on the counselors who were supposed to be watching him but instead were having sex, not paying attention to Jason's drowning. Revealing herself as the killer, Mrs. Voorhees turns violent and rushes toward Alice with a bowie knife, attempting to kill her. In the ensuing chase, Alice finds Annie's body inside Mrs. Voorhees' car and Steve's body hanging from the roof. Following a confrontation in which Mrs. Voorhees is knocked out, Alice escapes to the shore. Just as she begins to relax, Mrs. Voorhees finds her and attempts to kill her again. During the final struggle, Alice decapitates her with a machete. Afterwards, a traumatized Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe, which floats out on Crystal Lake.
