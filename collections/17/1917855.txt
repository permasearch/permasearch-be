Germany needed to acquire the knowledge behind the IJNAS' aerial torpedo technology, especially after the September 1943 capitulation of the Italians, because the Italian battleship Littorio was heavily damaged in the Battle of Taranto on November 11, 1940, and the German battleship Bismarck was hit by a single torpedo, which jammed its rudder and steering gear for hours on May 26, 1941. Germany also needed aerial torpedoes to attack the Allied transport ships steaming in the Mediterranean Sea.[10] It had previously imported Italian-made aerial torpedoes, which became unavailable following the Italian Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies in September 1943. The indigenous German aerial torpedo designs were badly restricted in launch speed and launch altitude.[citation needed]
