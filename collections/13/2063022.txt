In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Farrukhabad one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640).[23] It is one of the 34 districts in Uttar Pradesh currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).[23] Industrial development in the Farrukhabad district has been lethargic. This is despite the fact that Farrukhabad has been famous for its cloth printing and zardozi embroidery work. Zardosi remains Farrukhabad's primary industry spread across the city and its rural periphery. Approximately 1.75 lakh trained handicraftsmen are engaged in this industry and around 360 zardosi units are registered in the district. Zardosi embroidery from Farrukhabad is exported to many international markets in Europe, North America and Middle Eastern countries. In recent years, the Textile Ministry of India in collaboration with the state government of Uttar Pradesh  has proposed the setting up of a 'textile park' in Farrukhabad to promote local textile industry and create job opportunities for the local youth.[24]
