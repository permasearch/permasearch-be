During Chain of Memories, Naminé's memory-altering powers break the memories in Sora's heart as well as those of all his friends, leading Kairi to lose her memories of him. In Kingdom Hearts II, Kairi gradually remembers Sora as his own memories are restored. Later, Kairi is kidnapped by Axel in the hopes to use Kairi to lure Sora to him. However, Saïx takes Kairi from Axel and imprisons her in a jail cell in the World That Never Was. But with the help of Naminé and Riku, she escapes her cell and uses her Destiny's Embrace (デスティニープレイス, lit. "Destiny Place") Keyblade to fight the Heartless summoned by Saïx.[24] Kairi reunites with Sora's group to face and defeat Xemnas.[25] Kairi then returns with Sora and Riku to Destiny Islands.
