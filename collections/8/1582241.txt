Erlewine felt the song was a "gimmick" and "suggestive", but highlighted the song as an album standout.[29] PopMatters called complaints about the song "ridiculous" and added that they do not care if they are "transgender, bisexual, lesbian or gay. In the end, it's about people and yourself feeling safe and better together".[30] Bill Lamb from About.com had prospects for the song, feeling his view was "irrefutable".[31] Rebecca Bary from The New Zealand Herald said "Think 'Baby One More Time' spliced with 'Dirrty' and you have the biggest one-hit wonder of the year." She continued, saying "When these obnoxious, school-uniformed Russian maybe-lesbians poured their squirrelly hearts out over a repetitive dance beat, you can't deny it worked.".[32]
