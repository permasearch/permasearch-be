Changes in diet (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Malnutrition including chronic undernutrition and acute malnutrition is known to have caused stunted growth in various populations.[11] This has been seen in North Korea, parts of Africa, certain historical Europe, and other populations.[12] Developing countries such as Guatemala have rates of stunting in children under 5 living as high as 82.2% in Totonicap√°n, and 49.8% nationwide.[13]
