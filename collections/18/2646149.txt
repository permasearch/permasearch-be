The term comes from the Greek κορωνη, corönë ("knotted rod") and βακτηριον, bacterion ("rod"). The term "diphtheroids" is used to represent corynebacteria that are nonpathogenic; for example, C. diphtheriae would be excluded.[citation needed] The term diphtheroid comes from Greek διφθερα, diphthera—prepared hide, leather.[citation needed]
