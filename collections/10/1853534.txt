Jack Sells, the person at the center of the incident, left the coaching profession and successfully sued Kinko's for privacy violations, though he temporarily moved out of the state of Tennessee after being assaulted by an angry Vols fan in Chattanooga.[7][37]  After a stint as an assistant coach in the NFL, Zook succeeded Spurrier as the Gators' head coach in 2002.  He was reluctant to talk about "Faxgate" during his tenure at UF (2002â€“04), though when asked, he admitted that Sells' infamous transmission had actually been a set of hand-drawn Volunteer offensive plays. However, Zook insisted that they "were so immaterial, and it made no difference and had no relevance, it was nothing."[38]
