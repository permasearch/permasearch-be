Appalachian music is the traditional music of the region of Appalachia in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influencesâ€”including English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially fiddle music), hymns, and African-American blues.  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of Old-time music, country music, and bluegrass, and were an important part of the American folk music revival.
