In 1895 the remains of a vaulted box were discovered in the wine-pressing room of the villa. The box contained silver tableware consisting of 102 items and leather bag full of coins to the value of a thousand gold aurei. It is assumed that the objects were intentionally hidden in the storehouse before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. The last owner of the silver set was probably a woman named Maxima â€“ a name written on many of the vessels.
