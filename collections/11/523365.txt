The City of Seattle, King County, and the United Way of King County are the funders of the Committee to End Homelessness in King County and the Ten year plan to End Homelessness. The 10-year plan began in 2004 as an idea when a group of people consisting of leaders representing United Way of King County, businesses, faith based communities, housing organizations and human services organizations, homeless people and governments[which?] addressed the issue of homelessness. In 2005 the 10-year plan was completed. "The 10 year plans goals are to promote long-term and sustainable solutions to homelessness including alignment of funding, programs and services among the public, private and non-profit sectors."
