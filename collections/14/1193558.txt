On September 26, 2006, Facebook was opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[37][38][39] In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned.[40] Pages began rolling out for businesses in May 2009.[41] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion. Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements on the social networking site.[42][43]
