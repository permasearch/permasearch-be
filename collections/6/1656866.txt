At the center of the exhibit is a fully restored C-131 aircraft which only clears the walls on either side of the gallery by a mere six inches. The exhibit also contains two original flight simulators, made especially for the museum by Rockwell Collins. Flight presents material and interactives that explore three different modes of flight: buoyant, ballistic, and aerodynamic. Flight also includes a space for exploring the unique ways animals take to the skies.
