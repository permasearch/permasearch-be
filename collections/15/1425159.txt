In a letter to a friend, Adams wrote that the petition served no purpose, that war was inevitable and that the colonies should have already raised a navy and taken British officials prisoner. His letter was intercepted by British officials and news of its contents reached Great Britain at about the same time as the petition itself. British advocates of a military response to the colonists used Adams' letter to claim that the petition itself was insincere.[5]
