"Behave" is the third episode of the twelfth season of the police procedural Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and the 251st episode overall. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 29, 2010. The episode, which was inspired by rape kit backlogs, follows Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) helping a repeat rape victim (Jennifer Love Hewitt) stand up to her attacker, and finding the evidence to put him away. Meanwhile, the rapist (James Le Gros) could possibly walk because the evidence against him has been misplaced, poorly stored and even accidentally destroyed.
