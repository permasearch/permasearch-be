Many states allow for couples to file for a summary divorce based upon a jointly filed divorce petition. A summary divorce means the spouses have discussed the terms required by state law to issue a divorce and they have reached an mutual agreement. Almost, every state allow for this type of "uncontested" divorce.[25][26] An uncontested joint divorce petition will often save a divorcing couple both time and money.
