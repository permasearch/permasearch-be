In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.[344] In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.[345] When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God.[346] The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.[347] After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."[348] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.[349]
