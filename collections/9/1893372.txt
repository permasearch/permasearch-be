Astaire and Rogers made two movies in 1935, Roberta, which featured the song "I Won't Dance" and Top Hat, which also co-starred comedian Edward Everett Horton. In Roberta, Astaire and Rogers had a supporting role with Irene Dunne starring. In this film the song and dance, "I'll Be Hard to Handle", was an early example of the electricity and vivacity of the pairing. Top Hat marked the first time the duo had a film written solely for them, and it proved to be one of the most successful films of the year.[3] It was also, with The Gay Divorcee, among the most profitable films RKO Radio Pictures made in the 1930s.[citation needed]
