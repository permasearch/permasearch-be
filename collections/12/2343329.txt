Libraries written in C/C++ can be compiled to ARM, or x86 native code (or their 64-bit variants); or MIPS while both the 32-bit and 64-bit variants of are deprecated; and installed using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK). These native libraries can be called from Java code running under the Android Runtime using the System.loadLibrary call, which is part of the standard Android Java classes.[21][22]
