The Roaring Silence also featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist Barbara Thompson, and Watch included two stand-out recordings from the band's live performances of "Davy's on the Road Again" and "Mighty Quinn". Taking advantage of the publicity of their hit song, the band re-released another Springsteen song, "Spirit in the Night", which the band had released the previous year on Nightingales & Bombers in a vocally re-cut version with Chris Thompson taking a new lead vocal in place of Mick Rogers vocal on the original album version. Following this popular success, the Earth Band released Watch which produced another hit single in "Davy's on the Road Again".
