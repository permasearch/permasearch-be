In Phantom Hourglass, Biggoron is not his usual monstrous size, but of normal Goron heightâ€”though he remains the largest on Goron Island. Here he has a son named Gongoron. Link is required to answer his questions in order to be allowed further exploration of the island; when he responds correctly, he is then titled Goro-Link.
