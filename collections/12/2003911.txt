A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance.[88][89] For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign.[90][89] The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.[91]
