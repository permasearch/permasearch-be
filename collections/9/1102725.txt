After the sacking of Mourinho, Guus Hiddink was named caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2015–16 season. The team went 12 consecutive matches without a loss following the sacking of Mourinho, winning six and drawing six. This streak ended on 16 February 2016 after Chelsea lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.[104] Chelsea then lost the second leg of the round of 16, losing 2–1 at home thus being knocked out of the competition on 9 March. This was followed by an elimination from the FA Cup on 12 March after a 2–0 loss to Everton. League form improved, however, with Chelsea rising from 16th, one point away from relegation, to eighth place after an incredible fightback after going 1–0 down to win 1–2 away against Southampton.
