Turner has a reputation as a reluctant interviewee. Upon the release of Arctic Monkeys' debut album, Turner and his bandmates became known for being uninterested in self-promotion and suspicion of the media, even abandoning a press event in Paris.[84] While Turner became known for "cocky onstage bravado",[47] he was generally "quietly spoken" in interviews.[85] In a May 2006 interview, Dorian Lynskey noted that Turner was "harder to get a handle on [than his bandmates]. Fidgety and intense, heâ€™s the least talkative member of the group, chewing over his answers for so long that he ends up doubting his own words."[44]
