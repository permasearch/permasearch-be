On 26 April 1973, Harrison set up the Material World Charitable Foundation,[68] to which he donated the publishing royalties from "The Day the World Gets 'Round" and eight other songs on Living in the Material World.[69][70][nb 3] Part of the foundation's mission was to "encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies" and "[support] established charitable organizations with consideration to those with special needs"[75] â€“ so allowing Harrison to donate money without encountering the problems that had hampered the Bangladesh aid project.[76][77] In his 2009 book You Never Give Me Your Money, Doggett writes that the foundation "continues to fund worthy causes to this day".[78][nb 4]
