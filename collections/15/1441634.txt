In this book, Barton paints a picture of a strong Jesus, who worked with his hands, slept outdoors, and travelled on foot. This is very different from what he saw as the "Sunday School Jesus" â€” a physically weak, moralistic man, and the "lamb of God".[5][6] Barton describes Jesus as "the world's greatest business executive", and according to one of the chapter headings, "The Founder of Modern Business",[7] who created a world-conquering organization with a group of twelve men hand-picked from the bottom ranks of business.[4]
