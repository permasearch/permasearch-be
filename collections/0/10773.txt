Revelation is an apocalyptic prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia.[15] "Apocalypse" means the revealing of divine mysteries;[16] John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches.[15] The entire book constitutes the letterâ€”the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven.[15] While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other New Testament book.[17]
