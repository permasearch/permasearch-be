Wright was called up for England B duty in December 1989 but a twice-cracked shin bone reduced his initial impact in the First Division.[13] However, after recovering from the injury he made a dramatic appearance as a 'super-sub', in the 1990 FA Cup Final against Manchester United.[15] He equalised for Palace a few minutes after coming onto the field forcing extra time, then putting them ahead in extra time.[15] The eventual score was 3–3,[3] but Palace lost the replay 1–0.[15]
