Between June 1915 and June 1916 raiders from Mexico attacked people on American soil 38 times, resulting in the deaths of 26 soldiers and 11 civilians.[10] Reacting to the Glenn Springs raid, the Army transferred three regiments of regulars[n 19] to the border and also called up state militia units from Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico on May 8.[50][63] On June 15, 1916, another attempted raid by Mexican border-crossers, this at San Ygnacio, Texas, 30 miles downstream from Laredo, was repulsed by soldiers with casualties to both sides.[64] As a result, using powers granted by passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, which established the United States National Guard, Wilson on June 18 fully mobilized Guard units from the remainder of the states and the District of Columbia for duty on the border.[65] More than 140,000 National Guard troops were called up,[66] but only two regiments, the 1st New Mexico Infantry and the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, were assigned to the Mexican Expedition, and those to guard the base at Columbus.[67] Historian Clarence C. Clendenen asserts that although no Guard units officially crossed into Mexico at any time, soldiers from the two regiments at Columbus did enter Mexico to perform various tasks.[68]
