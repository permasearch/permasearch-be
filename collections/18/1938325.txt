Wayne State Universityâ€™s cost of attendance is composed of tuition, including a credit hour rate, student service credit hour fee, fitness center maintenance fee, and a registration fee. Class maintenance fees are applied on a course-to-course basis. The tuition varies depending on undergraduate (lower and upper level division) and graduate students. Although graduate programs, Law School and Medical School tuition differs. Additionally, these two categories can be further broken down into two more subcategories of out-of-state students and resident students.
