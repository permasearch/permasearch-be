In November 2014, Airbus announced that it was proceeding with the development of a larger replacement based on the Airbus A330-200; five of which will start operating from 2019, replacing the last old Beluga in 2025.[14][15][16] Airbus previously considered the A330-300 and A340-500, but each require too much of the limited 1,663 m (5,460 ft) runway 04 at Hawarden Airport near Broughton in Wales.[17] In May 2015, Airbus confirmed that the new aircraft will have a 1 m (3.3 ft) wider cross-section than its predecessor and provide a 12% increase in payload. The Beluga XL is intended primarily for A350 work, and is designed with capacity to ship two A350 wings simultaneously. Five aircraft will be progressively assembled; the first two are considered essential to ramping-up production of the A350; the remaining three are to be introduced as the A300-600 Beluga fleet retires.[18]
