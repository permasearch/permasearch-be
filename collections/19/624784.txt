The Diaz family car is damaged, from being crashed into the garage, and Suzy and Tom call a family meeting to find out which of their children is the culprit. Four of them have an alibi, but Harley and Ethan, who risk being put on lockdown, cannot back up their stories with witnesses, so they are put on trial in Diaz court. Things start looking grim for Harley's case as the testimony unfolds, and she feels compelled to confess her guilt, until evidence surfaces about a recording Ethan made and then erased. Harley later finds out that the recording was backed up on Tom's laptop and discovers it to be a video invitation for her quinceaÃ±era. After viewing some of the video, she could not hold Ethan responsible for the car damage and decides to take the blame, but Suzy and Tom share news they got from their mechanic about the car. It turns out none of the children are responsible, since the damage was caused by a malfunctioning transmission.
