Syntactic Structures is Chomsky's first book. It is a short monograph of about a hundred pages. Chomsky wrote it for specialists in linguistics. He based it on the lecture notes he had prepared for his students at MIT.[note 3] In it, he offered the now-famous sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."[9] This is a sentence with no clear meaning. Yet, grammar-wise it still seems instinctively correct to a native English speaker. For Chomsky, the study of syntax is thus independent of semantics (the study of meaning).[10]
