Several countries, regions, and cities have enacted legislation to ban or severely reduce the use of disposable plastic shopping bags. Outright bans have been introduced in some countries,[5] notably China, which banned very thin plastic bags nationwide in 2008.[2] Several other countries impose a tax at the point of sale.
