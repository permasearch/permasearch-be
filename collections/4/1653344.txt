His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. March 15, 1931), grew up in Homs, Syria and was born into an Arab Muslim household.[10] Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.[10] While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities.[10] Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science.[10] He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. August 1, 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin.[11][10][12] As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.[13] Jobs's full biological sister (Mona Simpson), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: "it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual."[13] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's official biographer, additionally states that Schieble's father "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.[11]
