For some cancer types, in addition to T, N, and M categories, prognostic factors are required to assign a stage group. Examples include tumor grade, age at diagnosis, histologic type, mitotic rate, serum tumor markers, hormone receptors, hereditary factors, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score. Specifically, cancer siteâ€“specific prognostic factors populate nonanatomic categories and are defined clearly if required for a particular disease site.
