Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi's life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal's Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar with their Mahatma Gandhi in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi's sexual life.[402] Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage "grossly distort[s]" the overall message of the book.[403] The 2014 film Welcome Back Gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India.[404]
