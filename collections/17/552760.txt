The Senate voted to acquit Chase of all charges on March 1, 1805. There were 34 Senators present (25 Republicans and 9 Federalists), and 23 votes were needed to reach the required two-thirds majority. Of the eight votes cast, the closest vote was 18 for impeachment and 16 for acquittal in regards to the Baltimore grand jury charge.[12] He is the only U.S. Supreme Court justice to have been impeached.[3] Judge Alexander Pope Humphrey recorded in the Virginia Law Register an account of the impeachment trial and acquittal of Chase.[13]
