On August 11, 2012, the Romney campaign officially announced Ryan as its choice for Vice President through its "Mitt's VP" mobile app[86] as well as by the social networking service Twitter,[citation needed] about 90 minutes before Romney's in-person introduction.[citation needed] Before the official announcement in Norfolk, Virginia, it was reported that Romney made his decision, and offered the position to Ryan on August 1, 2012,[87] the day after returning from a foreign policy trip through the United Kingdom, Poland and Israel.[88]
