San Angelo has a diverse economy for a city of its size.[30] Although most oil fields lie to the west, many oil-field service companies based in the city employ a large number of local residents. The agricultural industry in San Angelo remains strong. Producer's Livestock Auction is the nation's largest for sheep and lambs, and is among the top five in the nation for cattle auctions. Though most agricultural work is done outside the city, thousands of employees work in the cattle and lamb meat-processing industries, and many more work in agriculture supporting roles inside the city.[31] Two agricultural research centers are located in San Angelo: the Angelo State University Management Instruction and Research Center[32] and the Texas A&M Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center at San Angelo.[33]
