Quark receives a shuttle that his cousin Gaila has been promising him for years. He christens it Quark's Treasure and for its maiden voyage takes his brother Rom and nephew Nog to Earth, where Nog has been accepted to Starfleet Academy in San Francisco. Quark also intends to make the trip financially profitable by smuggling a load of illicit kemocite explosives to the Orion Syndicate on the return voyage.
