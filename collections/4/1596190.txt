Accuracy is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.[7] To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the "Rand accuracy" or "Rand index".[8][9][10] It is a parameter of the test.
