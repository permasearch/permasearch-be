Gomez embarked on her Stars Dance Tour on August 14, 2013.[133] After touring in North America and Europe, the tour was set to continue throughout 2014, though Gomez cancelled the Australian and Asian leg of the tour in December 2013, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[134] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[135][136] Her representative stated that she had spent time there "voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse."[137][138] Despite initially neglecting to comment, Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with the auto-immune disease, lupus, and that she had cancelled the tour and entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[139][140] Gomez appeared in the film Behaving Badly (2014) with Dylan McDermott and Nat Wolff.[141] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August 2014 to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[142][143][144][145] Even the author of the original autobiographical novel, has disavowed the film.[146] She later appeared in the film Rudderless (2014), the directorial debut of William H. Macy.[147][148][149] The independent film received a mixed reception from critics.[150][151]
