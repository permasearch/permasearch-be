The need for banks of phages makes regulatory testing for safety harder and more expensive under current rules in most countries.

Additionally, patent issues (specifically on living organisms) may complicate distribution for pharmaceutical companies wishing to have exclusive rights over their "invention", which would discourage a commercial corporation from investing capital in this.
