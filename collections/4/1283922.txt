Among those who were alive during the haunting, Ingram conducted interviews with Ibby Gunn, born in 1806, a daughter of Uncle Zeke and the sister-in-law of Dean, as well as Mahala Byrns Darden, born circa 1807, daughter of James Byrns. Ibby Gunn shared some experiences of Dean including the creation of a witch ball made of hair by her sister Kate for her husband Dean, the use of which appeared to anger the entity.[58] Mahala Darden detailed what she understood family and friends were experiencing at the time of the haunting, expressed her great fear the witch would come visit her home and also related the spirit sang drinking songs at John Bell's graveside.[59]
