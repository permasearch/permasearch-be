In September 2013, Air France introduced a brand new Economy product along with an improved Premium Economy seat and service.  It is expected that the new improvements would be fitted on aircraft from June 2014 onwards.[39] In October 2013, Air France-KLM announced they were writing off the 25% stake in Alitalia, as it was hesitant the struggling carrier would obtain the 300 million euros in financing.  The group has denied Alitalia of additional funds as it is currently struggling to restructure itself to profitability with the Transform 2015 plan.[40]
