The 17-year periodical cicadas are distributed across the eastern, upper midwestern, and Great Plains states within the U.S., while the 13-year cicadas occur in the southern and Mississippi Valley states, but some may overlap slightly. For example, Broods IV (17-year cycle) and XIX (13-year cycle) overlap in western Missouri and eastern Oklahoma.[36][37] Their emergences should again coincide in 2219, 2440, 2661, etc., as they did in 1998[38] (although distributions change slightly from generation to generation and older distribution maps can be unreliable.[37]). An effort is currently underway to generate new distribution maps of all periodical cicada broods.  This effort makes use of crowdsourced records and records collected by entomologists.[39]
