Durrani was born in or about 1722 to Mohammad Zaman Khan, chief of the Abdali tribe and Governor of Herat, and Zarghuna Alakozai. There has been some debate about Durrani's exact place of birth.[10] Most believe that he was born in Herat, Afghanistan.[1][4][11][12][13][14] He was born as Ahmed Khan.[15] Abdali's father suffered "Persian captivity for many years" at Kirman before being released from prison in 1715.[15] As a refugee, he "made his way to India" and joined his kinsmen at Multan.[15] After he raised his family there, he was recognized as the "scion of hereditary Sadozai chiefs". It is believed that Zaman Khan returned to Afghanistan to fight the Persians and his Afghan rivals,[citation needed] but left one of his wives at Multan because she was "in the family way". So other sources believe that, Abdali was born at Multan in 1722, after which she returned to Afghanistan to reunite with her husband. He lost his father during his infancy.[16]
