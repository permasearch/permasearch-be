The Money in the Bank ladder match can involve anywhere from 5â€“10 participants, with the objective being to retrieve a briefcase that is suspended 20 feet above the ring. The match was originally only for male wrestlers until 2017 when women began to have their own ladder match.[1] The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees a match for a world championship, and beginning in 2017, a women's championship. Originally, wrestlers had the option between the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship, regardless of the brand the wrestler belonged to. In 2006, ECW's world title, the ECW Championship, became a third option until 2010 as in February that year, the ECW brand along with the title was deactivated. Beginning with the inaugural  Money in the Bank pay-per-view in 2010, the event included two ladder matches, one for the Raw brand and one for SmackDown; Raw's ladder match was for a contract for a WWE Championship match while SmackDown's contract was for a World Heavyweight Championship match. Although the brand split ended after the 2011 event, a ladder match dedicated to each championship continued through the 2013 event. In December 2013, the titles were unified into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. The next three years' events included a sole ladder match with a contract guaranteeing a match for the unified title. The brand split returned after the 2016 event. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship (renamed WWE Championship) was made exclusive to SmackDown while Raw established the WWE Universal Championship as their top title. Despite this, the 2017 event was made a SmackDown exclusive pay-per-view and the contract was for its world title. The 2017 event also saw the first Women's Money in the Bank match with its contract for a SmackDown Women's Championship match.[1][2] The 2018 event was dual branded, involving both the Raw and SmackDown brands.
