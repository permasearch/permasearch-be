In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the HÃ´tel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.[44]
