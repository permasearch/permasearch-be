William Chambers' 1788 literary survey of Mahabalipuram brought the monuments to the attention of European scholars.[26] Chambers interviewed local residents and linked the monumental art he saw to Hindu texts, calling it remarkable and expressive in narrative detail.[27] A series of 19th-century studies, such as those by Benjamin Babington and William Elliot, contained sketches of the monuments and impressions of the inscriptions.[28] Some stories and speculation in Western literature, nevertheless, continued to be unusual. Francis Wilford suggested in 1809 that the monuments were built in 450 BCE, linking them to Cicero's writings about Indians who might have built three ancient Indian temple cities (including Mahabalipuram).[27]
