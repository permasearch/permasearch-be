Albert Hillsborough is a fourteen-year-old African-American student in charge of food, water, and work in Perdido Beach. He is considered by many to be the most powerful person in the FAYZ. He later retreats to the luxurious island of San Francisco de Sales for a short period of time to escape the chaos that would following the dome going dark. He is a true "businessman" despite his young age, and is clever and powerful. However, he can be selfish and somewhat of a coward. In addition, he is the inventor of the official currency of the FAYZ, until they start to become worthless in Fear. He is known for his wealth and enterprising. Albert's previous fame in the FAYZ was being the "owner" of the only McDonald's restaurant in the town-which he ran until it ran out of supplies, at which point it was renamed to the McClub, and was turned into a place where kids could dance and enjoy themselves. Albert continued to run it like this until the power was turned off. Albert was a very responsible boy and faced many horrible things. He encountered a ferocious teleporting cat that gave him wounds and sort of admires Astrid's smart mind. His first idea for a money system for the FAYZ is to use some gold bars he finds in Hermit Jim's Cabin. He melts these into bullets, calling them 'units'. Albert, with help from Howard, renames the currency he invents as the 'Berto. The standard salary in FAYZ as of Lies is about 3-5 Bertos per day, but some of the people in FAYZ who got a more important job, like Sam, receive larger sums.
