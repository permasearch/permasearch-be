On a ship bound for America, Shannon meets Mr. McGuire, who tells them about America's free land, convincing them both of its arability. He tells them it is in Oklahoma, informing them that once they get there, they must race to claim it like everyone else. She explains that her collection of valuable silver spoons will cover all expenses to get the pair to Oklahoma, and McGuire offers to help her find a shop to sell them to once they arrive in America.
