In 1882 Congress passed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting Chinese laborers from immigrating into the United States.[9] Senator James G. Blaine proposed the idea in 1879 in an effort to prohibit the Chinese from taking over the Pacific slope and avoid the possibility of another civil war.[11]
