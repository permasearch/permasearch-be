Scully tried tracking down the Man in Black, but is being chased by the ghost of one of the Boggs, who wishes to capture Scully for helping the "pink bellies" escape the island while they were shipwrecked. Scully distracts them with a trial, and manages to escape and tell Puffin to get Rogers help. Lord Rogers has a glass jar used for holding a ghost, as glass is the only thing that can hold a ghost, as well as a ghost rope.
