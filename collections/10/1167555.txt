The Detroit Tigers also play the beginning of "Don't Stop Believing" in the eighth inning, showing the lyrics on the big screen. Fan will sing along, especially the line, "born and raised in South Detroit.". Of course, there is no area called South Detroit by Detroiters, as Downtown Detroit is considered geographically south (and, therefore, South Detroit would actually be in Windsor, Ontario, Canada).
