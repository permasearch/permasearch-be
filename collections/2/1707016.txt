Many scientists now consider the five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria); Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals)[15]  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.[15]
