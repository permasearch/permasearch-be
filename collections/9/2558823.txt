The North Vietnamese invaders succeeded in conquering the border provinces of Phongsali and Xam Neua, which were adjacent to northern Vietnam and on the northeastern verge of the Plain of Jars.[33] They then moved aside to allow the Pathet Lao force with its mismatched scrounged equipment to occupy the captured ground,[34] and Souphanouvong moved the Pathet Lao headquarters into Xam Neua on 19 April.
