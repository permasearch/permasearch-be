An O-type star is a hot, blue-white star of spectral type O in the Yerkes classification system employed by astronomers. They have temperatures in excess of 30,000 kelvins (K) and so appear to the left on the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram. Stars of this type are identified by their dominant Helium II absorption lines, strong lines of other ionised elements, and Hydrogen and neutral He lines weaker than spectral type B.
