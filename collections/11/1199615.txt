Other issues that Native Americans are facing are mental health and suicide. Native Americans have the highest rate of suicide out of any ethnic group in the United States, in 2009 suicide was the leading cause of death among Native Americans and Native Alaskans between the ages of 10 and 34.[56] 75% of deaths among Native Americans and Native Alaskans over the age of 10 are due to unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide.[56] Suicide rates among Native American youths is significantly higher than the suicide rates among white youths.[56] The head of the IHS, Mary L. Smith, says[when?] that there will be a new focus on mental health issues in Native American communities, and that since there is a tremendous amount of suicide among teens on the Pine Ridge reservation they are designating it a Promise Zone and sending extra help.[57] Native people's mental health is also effected by being stigmatized as drunks the media in movies and, which negatively impacts their mental health and self-esteem. Potentially, If native people are constantly told that they are drunks, some may just accept that this is all society will see of them and give into depression and alcoholism. Native children are not given role models in movies or TV to look up to, which impacts what they believe possible for their futures.[58]
