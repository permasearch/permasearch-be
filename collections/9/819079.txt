In Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), Bai-muajjal is a "credit sale", i.e. the sale of goods on a deferred payment basis. In Islamic finance, the bai' muajjal product also involves the price markup of a murabahah contract, and a murabahah product involves a bai-muajjal deferred payment. Thus the terms and are often used interchangeably, (according to Hans Visser),[283] or "in practice ... used together" (according to Faleel Jamaldeen).[254][284]
