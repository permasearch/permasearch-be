Lou Macari was the only child of Margaret and Albert; he was born in Edinburgh, and spent the first year of his life with his family in the village of Newtongrange, before the family moved to London.[4] His father was in the catering industry, and had represented the British Army at football.[5] The family moved to Largs in North Ayrshire when Macari was aged nine.[6] He was spotted playing for Ayrshire county by Celtic, and signed schoolboy forms for the club at the age of 16.[7] He turned professional at the club in 1968, on wages of Â£15 a week.[8]
