Dekker portrays Jesse, Kris's ex-boyfriend. According to Dekker, "Jesse kind of knows what's going on but refuses to believe it."[22] Dekker explained that Jesse spends so much time trying to convince himself that Freddy is not real, that by the time he does meet Freddy face-to-face, "he's just a mess.. [...] There's no bravado about it. His terror is very real."[22] Lutz plays Dean, Kris's current boyfriend and "a well-liked, well-off high school jock".[23] Connie Britton and Clancy Brown also star.[24] Gallner and Mara explained that the teenagers in the remake are "a little more aware" of Freddy and their situation, whereas in the original Gallner and Mara characterized Nancy and her friends as "more mellow" and "nonchalant" about their situation until they were finally killed.[14]
