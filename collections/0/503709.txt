Indiana passed a law in 2005 requiring a photo ID be shown by all voters before casting ballots.[29] Civil rights groups in Indiana launched a lawsuit, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, that reached the Supreme Court in 2008. The Court ruled that the law was constitutional, paving the way for expanded ID laws in other states.[30][31]
