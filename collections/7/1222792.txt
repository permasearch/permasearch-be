Aiden Spencer is the son of Lucky Spencer and Elizabeth Webber. From 2011 to 2012, the role was played by Titus Jackson, real-life son to Jonathan Jackson, who played his on-screen father, Lucky.[27] Jason David took over the role in 2012.[19] He is born onscreen in July 2010. He was originally believed to be the son of Nikolas Cassadine, after Helena Cassadine switched a paternity test. Aiden was kidnapped by Franco from the hospital, and he gave Aiden to his mother. Lucky finds Aiden and returns him to Elizabeth and Nikolas. Elizabeth is suspicious of how much Aiden looks like Lucky and gets another DNA test, which shows Lucky is really his father. She tells Lucky and Nikolas months later, and Nikolas briefly kidnaps Aiden before returning him to Elizabeth and Lucky. When Aiden is diagnosed with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), he receives a blood transfusion from his aunt Lulu, and fully recovers.
