Roache was initially offered the role of Ken on a thirteen-episode, six-week contract.[7][10] His agent convinced him to take it, as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of Marking Time.[8] Coronation Street was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended. Roache was given a six-month contract in early 1961, followed by a one-year contract in June of that year, which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been "leading a hand-to-mouth existence".[11] The series became a long-running soap opera, airing multiple times weekly, and Roache continued in the role, though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent.[12] Roache originally earned ₤10 per episode, compared to the ₤3,000 per episode that he earned in 2010.[13] He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in Coronation Street for a short time, once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with "such colossal impact", he realised it was something special.[14] At the time, Roache needed to be sure it wasn't a mistake to sign up; later he said, "If I had known it would turn out to be my life's work, I would have run a mile."[13]
