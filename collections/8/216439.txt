Millets are traditionally important grains used in brewing millet beer in some cultures, for instance by the Tao people of Orchid Island[citation needed] and the Amis or Atayal of Taiwan. Various peoples in East Africa brew a drink from millet or sorghum known as ajono, a traditional brew of the Teso. The fermented millet is prepared in a large pot with hot water and people share the drink by sipping it through long straws.
