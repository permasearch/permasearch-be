The first challenge starts with the rappers split into two teams, The red team consists of Jus Rhyme, Persia, Jon Boy, and John Brown; and the blue team consists of $hamrock, 100 Proof, and Sullee. The teams are to come up with some lyrics to record in a professional studio. While planning their performance, Sullee and 100 Proof break out the liquor to loosen their nerves. They later travel to the studio in Manhattan where the audio will be mastered by producer Just Blaze and his associates, DJ Nastee and Ryan West. Each team is allocated two hours to record a song. During the recording session, the white rappers are continuing to show their disinterest in Jus Rhyme's unique perspective on things. Persia later describes him as "an odd soul." During the recording, $hamrock hears himself on a sour note and appears surprised at himself. The red team ends their record with a shout-out from Just Blaze. The results of the competition will be determined later when the recordings are played at a local club.
