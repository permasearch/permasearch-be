In November 2009 it was reported that a rugby mid-year Test match between the Springboks and France scheduled to take place in Cape Town on 12 June 2010 would be moved to Europe, due to FIFA regulations banning other sport events in host cities during the time of the World Cup.[48] After negotiations between the South African Rugby Union and members of the local organising committee, it was announced that the Test would be allowed to take place in Cape Town on the originally scheduled date because no World Cup match was to be played in Cape Town on that day, and the Test would be played at Newlands, which is not a World Cup venue.[49][50]
