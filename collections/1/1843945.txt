The series revolves around married, vanilla thirty-somethings Jack and Emma Trakarsky, from Portland, Oregon, whose sex life has been slowly dying. In an effort to reinvigorate their sex life and possibly conceive a child together, they decide to bring Izzy, a 25-year-old college student and part-time escort, into their marriage, initially intending it to be a purely business-like arrangement. When both start to develop romantic feelings for Izzy, and vice versa, they find themselves having to navigate their way through a minefield of prying neighbours with very narrow social norms and prejudices, whilst at the same time struggling to confront their own feelings and insecurities, and adjust to the unfamiliar dynamic of a polyamorous relationship.
