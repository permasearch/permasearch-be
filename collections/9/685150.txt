The melody of the song was developed by Swift on a piano and she asked Martin and Shellback to make the final sound "as chaotic as that emotion felt".[19] She also wanted to sing the bassline of the song in a particular way and sound, to which Martin and Shellback suggested to infuse little bit of dubstep.[19] Unaware of the fact that the sound she had asked for in "I Knew You Were Trouble" was actually dubstep, Swift recalled having listened to dubstep music presented to her by British musician Ed Sheeran, who played her the songs popular in the UK clubs. However, she confessed that she had not studied that particular genre of sound further.[19]
