Jackson began storyboarding the trilogy with Christian Rivers in August 1997,[1] effectively creating a rough black and white 2-D version of the film. Jackson showed excerpts of the "animated" storyboards (filmed images with voices and a temporary soundtrack) to allow potential cast a view of the film's style.
