Since then, reissues and/or remixes of the Frankie Goes to Hollywood recording of this song have been top 10 UK hits on two other occasions, hitting #10 in 1993 and #6 in 2000. "The Power of Love" has also charted in the UK in a version by Holly Johnson (a solo recording from 1999). The original version by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was featured in the 2012 film Sightseers, the same year that the song was reissued as a digital download and peaked at #42, in response to a cover version by Gabrielle Aplin. Aplin's recording of the song also went to #1 in the UK, exactly 28 years after the original Frankie Goes To Hollywood single topped the charts.
