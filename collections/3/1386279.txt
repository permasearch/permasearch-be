The medal was instituted by Queen Victoria on April 10, 1900.[5] The name translates as "Emperor of India", a name also used for a rare Indian butterfly Teinopalpus imperialis. The Royal Warrant for the Kaisar-i-Hind was amended in 1901, 1912, 1933 and 1939. While never officially rescinded, the Kaisar-i-Hind ceased to be awarded following the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947.[6] The awards of the gold medal were often published in the London Gazette, while other classes were published in the Gazette of India.
