England's tour of the antipodes continued with the tour of New Zealand and Cook made a great start in the warm up matches, making a half century[115] followed by an unbeaten 138[116] the following day in limited overs matches. His style was still considered too slow for the following two Twenty20 Internationals and he failed to continue his form in the first ODI where he fell for 11 as part of an England collapse.[117][118] The second match saw a similar collapse by England where Cook's 52 was the only real contribution until he was run out by fellow Essexian Ravi Bopara.[119][120] The fourth one day match saw Cook and Phil Mustard prop up the innings with an opening stand of 158 before both being dismissed in successive balls, leading to a tied match.[121][122]
