According to a hypothesis developed by Jean Sauvaget, the umayyad quṣūr played a role in the systematic agricultural colonisation of the uninhabited frontier areas, and, as such, continue the colonisation strategy of earlier Christian monks and the Ghassanids.[69] The Umayyads, however, increasingly oriented their political strategy towards a model of Client politics, of mutual interdependence and support.[70] After the Umayyad conquest, the quṣūr lost their original function and were either abandoned or continued to serve as local market places and meeting points until the tenth century.[67] Another type of Islamic fortress is Qalat.
