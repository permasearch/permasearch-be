Triceratops teeth were arranged in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in each side of each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, depending on the size of the animal.[49] This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal).[49] They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation.[49] The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that they ate large volumes of fibrous plant material,[49] with some suggesting palms and cycads,[58][59] and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.[60]
