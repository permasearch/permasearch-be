Mason called Taft's years in the White House "undistinguished".[123] Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress, but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill.[124] Anderson noted that Taft's pre-presidential federal service was entirely in appointed posts, and that he had never run for an important executive or legislative position, which would have allowed him to develop the skills to manipulate public opinion, "the presidency is no place for on-the-job training".[125] According to Coletta, "in troubled times in which the people demanded progressive change, he saw the existing order as good."[126]
