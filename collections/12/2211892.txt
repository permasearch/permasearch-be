Barbershops have a long history of serving as community centers, where men would gather for a variety of activities. English "barber's music", for example, was described in the 17th century by Samuel Pepys as amateur instrumental music.[6] In the United States, the role of the barbershop continued, particularly for African American men, who passed time there singing spirituals, folk songs and popular songs. This generated a new style, consisting of unaccompanied, four-part, close-harmony singing. Later, white minstrel singers adopted the style, and in the early days of the recording industry their performances were recorded and sold. Early standards included songs such as "Shine On, Harvest Moon", "Hello, Ma Baby", and "Sweet Adeline".
