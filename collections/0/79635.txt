At about 8:20Â p.m. on 25 September 2007, a hydrothermal eruption occurred without warning.[8][9] William Pike, a 22-year-old primary school teacher, had a leg crushed by a rock during the eruption and a rescue operation was mounted to rescue him from the Dome Shelter near the crater. The rock crashed into the Dome Shelter, landed on the man and was too heavy for his companion to lift off.
