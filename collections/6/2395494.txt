In the fourth-season finale, Thirteen takes the test and is diagnosed as having the mutated Huntington gene. Shortly after this, she begins to display reckless behavior, having casual sex with random women, using drugs, partying late and showing up at the clinic hungover. In "Lucky Thirteen", House fires her for her recklessness after Cuddy finds her self-administering IV fluids after a night of hard partying. However, he allows her back on his team after she manages to solve a case, which is revealed to be part of House' scheme. Her risk-taking does not stop until the episode "Last Resort", in which she is forcibly injected with different medications and comes close to death, realizing her desire to keep living. Following this experience, she asks Foreman to admit her to the Huntington's drug trial that he is an administrator for.
