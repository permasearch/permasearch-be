Works of classical music, opera, and ballet directly or indirectly inspired by the myth of Prometheus have included renderings by some of the major composers of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this tradition, the orchestral representation of the myth has received the most sustained attention of composers. These have included the symphonic poem by Franz Liszt titled Prometheus from 1850, among his other Symphonic Poems (No. 5, S.99).[80] Alexander Scriabin composed Prometheus: Poem of Fire, Opus 60 (1910),[81] also for orchestra.[82] In the same year Gabriel Fauré composed his three-act opera Prométhée (1910).[83] Charles-Valentin Alkan composed his Grande sonate 'Les quatre âges' (1847), with the 4th movement entitled "Prométhée enchaîné" (Prometheus Bound).[84] Beethoven composed the score to a ballet version of the myth titled The Creatures of Prometheus (1801).[85]
