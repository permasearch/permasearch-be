The success of 77 Sunset Strip led to the creation of several other detective shows in exotic locales, all produced by the Warner Bros. studio, which created Strip â€” Bourbon Street Beat in New Orleans, Hawaiian Eye in Honolulu, and Surfside 6 in Miami Beach. The casts and scripts of these various shows sometimes crossed over, which was logistically easy, since they were all shot in Burbank on the Warner Bros. lot.[citation needed]
