Trilingual editions without such imitations were also appearing both in Britain and abroad. Gray’s Elegy in English, French and Latin was published from Croydon in 1788. The French author there was Pierre Guédon de Berchère and the Latin translator (like Gray and Anstey, a Cambridge graduate) was Gilbert Wakefield.[89] In 1793 there was an Italian edition of Giuseppe Torelli’s translation in rhymed quatrains which had first appeared in 1776. This was printed facing Gray’s original and was succeeded by Melchiorre Cesarotti’s translation in blank verse and Giovanni Costa’s Latin version, both of which dated from 1772.[90] A French publication ingeniously followed suit by including the Elegy in an 1816 guide to the Père Lachaise Cemetery, accompanied by Torelli's Italian translation and Pierre-Joseph Charrin’s free Le Cimetière de village.[91]
