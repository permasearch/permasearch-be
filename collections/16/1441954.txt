An association between vasectomy and primary progressive aphasia, a rare variety of frontotemporal dementia, was reported.[24] However, it is unclear if there is a causal relationship.[26] The putative mechanism is a cross-reactivity between brain and sperm, including the shared presence of neural surface antigens.[27] In addition, the cytoskeletal tau protein has been found only to exist outside of the CNS in the manchette of sperm.[27]
