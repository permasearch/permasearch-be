The drones used for the show had a plastic and foam body for soft impacts, and were about 1 foot (0.30 m) square and weighed 8 ounces (0.50 lb). They were connected to a central computer through wireless and executed individual choreography, each being oblivious to what the other drones' position was. The computer checked the GPS signal strength and battery level of the drones, while assigning their roles accordingly. Intel had started preparing from early December 2016, working out the logistics. After coming to a consensus with the creative team, they started storyboarding the drones, finally accepting to display a star array, the American flag and the Pepsi logo.[37]
