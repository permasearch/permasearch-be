Soledad is used as a backdrop in John Steinbeck's 1937 novel Of Mice and Men, an emotional story about two close friends of opposite personalities who must farm others' land to make meager living, and who dream desperately of buying a patch of land to have a farm of their own. One of the most important themes of the novel is tragic loneliness, which is likely one of the reason why Soledad was chosen as the setting, as soledad is Spanish for 'solitude'.
