Buffalo Grove relies on multiple arterial roads. Going north-south, the village uses Milwaukee Avenue (Illinois Route 21) on the east, Buffalo Grove Road and Weiland Road down the center, and Arlington Heights Road on the west. Going east-west, the village uses Dundee Road (Illinois Route 68) to its south, Lake-Cook Road and Deerfield Parkway towards the center, and both Aptakisic and Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) to its north. McHenry Road (Illinois Route 83) acts as a diagonal road in the village, going north-south in some portions, but east-west in others.[citation needed]
