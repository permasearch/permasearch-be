Parnell's leadership was first put to the test in February 1886 when he forced the candidature of Captain William O'Shea, who had negotiated the Kilmainham Treaty, for a Galway by-election. Parnell rode roughshod over his lieutenants Healy, Dillon and O'Brien who were not in favour of O'Shea. Galway was the harbinger of the fatal crisis to come.[5] O'Shea had already separated from his wife Katharine O'Shea, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance. Mrs. O'Shea acted as liaison in 1885 with Gladstone during proposals for the First Home Rule Bill.[36] Parnell later took up residence with her in Eltham, Kent, in the summer of 1886,[9] and was a known overnight visitor at the O'Shea house in Brockley, London.[37] When Mrs O'Shea's aunt died in 1889, her money was left in trust.
