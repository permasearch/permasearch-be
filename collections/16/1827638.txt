A proposed change to the Australian Constitution begins as a Bill that is presented to the Federal Parliament. If the Bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament, case committees are developed, a writ for a referendum is issued by the Governor-General, and a referendum is then presented to Australian voters, where it is passed if approved by a majority of people and majority of states.[7][8]
