Former Celtic captain Jock Stein succeeded McGrory in 1965.[33] Stein guided Celtic to nine straight Scottish League wins from 1966 to 1974, equalling the then world record,[34] and a feat which was not matched again in Scotland until 1997 by Rangers.[35] He won the Scottish Cup with Celtic in his first few months at the club,[36] and then led them to the League title the following season.[37]
