Radiology is an expanding field in medicine. Applying for residency positions in radiology is competitive. Applicants are often near the top of their medical school classes, with high USMLE (board) scores.[10] The field is rapidly expanding due to advances in computer technology, which is closely linked to modern imaging. Diagnostic Radiologists must complete prerequisite undergraduate education, four years of medical school to earn a medical degree (D.O. or M.D.), one year of internship, and four years of residency training. After residency, Radiologists may pursue one or two years of additional specialty fellowship training.
