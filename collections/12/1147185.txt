Individual members can organize their own deviations into folders on their personal pages.[40] The member pages (profiles) show a member's personally uploaded deviations and journal postings.[46] Journals are like personal blogs for the member pages, and the choice of topic is up to each member; some use it to talk about their personal or art-related lives, others use it to spread awareness or marshal support for a cause.[47] Also displayed are a member's "favorites", a collection of other users' images from DeviantArt that a member saves to its own folder.[48] Another thing found on the profile page is a member's "watchers"; a member adds another member to their "watch list" in order to be notified when that member uploads something.[47] The watcher notifications are gathered in a member's Message Center with other notices, like when other users comment on that memberâ€™s deviations, or when the member's image has been put in someone's favorites.[47]
