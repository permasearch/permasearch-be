The 10th house lives up to its promise if a benefic sign falls on the 10th house, its lord strong in all respects situated in benefic vargas associates with other planets who are also likewise vested with requisite strength, are beneficially inclined, own gainful bhavas preferably the lagna or the trikonas, and are in occupation of many benefic vargas. It is implied that a sign is vested with requisite strength if it is not influenced by unfriendly papa-grahas but by its own lord and/or friendly shubha-grahas, that the lord of the 10th house and the planets not owning unfavourable bhavas associating with it not situated in inimical signs, debilitation signs, in unfavourable bhavas, are not combust or in rasi-sandhi or bhava-sandhi. Phaladeepika (Sloka II.27) lists the dark-half Moon, the Sun, Mars, Rahu, Ketu and Saturn as papa-grahas; Mercury associating with papa-grahas acts as a papa-graha.[4] Mantreswara, the author of Phaladeepika (vide Slokas XVI.27-28 p.Â 767) states that if there is a benefic in the 10th house and the strong lord of the 10th is in its own sign or if situated in its own sign is in a kendra or a trikona or the strong lord of the lagna is in the 10th house then one becomes fortunate, long-lived, engages in noble works, earns fame and enjoys the benefits of Raja yogas. The Sun or Mars situated in the 10th make one enterprising, valourous and popular if the lord of the 10th is also in a favourable sign and house, a benefic planet in the 10th makes one engage in praiseworthy acts but Saturn, Rahu or Ketu therein make one commit evil or unworthy deeds.
