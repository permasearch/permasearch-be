Roundabouts were constructed at each end of The Causeway, to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network.[25] The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954.[26] Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers.[26] In 1973 construction began on a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of the Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.[27]
