Two weeks before the game's release, Nintendo uploaded a Broadway-inspired promotional music video of the song, which featured live action dancers alongside a CGI animated Mario.[34] The song was released on iTunes shortly after, breaking into the top 40 best sellers on the platform in the United States.[35][36] A four-disc, 136 track complete soundtrack was released in Japan by Being Inc. in February 2018. It includes Japanese versions of "Jump Up, Super Star!" and "Break Free (Lead The Way)", as well as commentary from staff members who worked on the game.[37][38] In addition to the full soundtrack, a 12-track digital album featuring a selection of the game's music was released worldwide on iTunes in December 2017.[33]
