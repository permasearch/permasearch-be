In late 1940s, Cage started developing further methods of breaking away with traditional harmony. For instance, in String Quartet in Four Parts (1950) Cage first composed a number of gamuts: chords with fixed instrumentation. The piece progresses from one gamut to another. In each instance the gamut was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony.[28] Concerto for prepared piano (1950â€“51) used a system of charts of durations, dynamics, melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns.[28] The last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.[82]
