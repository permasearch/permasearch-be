The word ikigai usually is used to indicate the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.[5] Secondly, the word is used to refer to mental and spiritual circumstances under which individuals feel that their lives are valuable. It's not linked to one's financial status[5]. Even if a person feels that the present is dark, but they have a goal in mind, they may feel ikigai.  Behaviours that make one feel ikigai are not actions one is forced to takeâ€”these are natural and spontaneous actions.
