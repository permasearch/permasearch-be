Jersey Cash 5 is a daily game that draws five balls numbered from 1 through 43. Drawings are held nightly, and the cost is $1 per game. The top prize (matching all 5 numbers drawn) is a progressive jackpot.[5] that starts at $75,000 (estimated). The jackpot increases each day until a wager matches all 5 numbers drawn. The jackpot amount is shared between each winning ticket if there's more than one.[7]
