At the vast majority of campuses, the academic schedule was organized on the basis of four 12-week academic quarters in a calendar year, with new students beginning at the start of each academic quarter. Using that calendar, students taking a full course load could complete associate degree programs in seven or eight academic quarters, bachelor's degree programs in 14 or 15 academic quarters or a master's degree program in seven academic quarters.[3]
