Mughal India (16th to 18th centuries) was the most important center of manufacturing in international trade up until the 18th century.[49] Up until 1750, India produced about 25% of the world's industrial output.[50] The largest manufacturing industry in Mughal India was textile manufacturing, particularly cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of India's international trade.[51] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[52] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[49] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[53]
