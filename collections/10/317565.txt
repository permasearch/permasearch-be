Most African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[43] As an adjective, the term is usually written African-American.[44] The first West Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[45] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[46] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[47] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[48][49] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[50] By 1804, the northern states (north of the Masonâ€“Dixon line) had abolished slavery.[51] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[52] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[53] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[54] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 due to the Civil Rights Movement.[55]
