In the 1980s her fur colour is either multi-pastel coloured (In greeting card illustrations and as a plush toy), or pastel yellow with a pink and purple tuft of hair on her head (In the second movie and the TV series), and her belly symbol is a multi-coloured star radiating from a central heart. In Care Bears: Oopsy Does It! and Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot, she was redesigned. She now has pastel pink coloured fur and her belly symbol remains the same.[citation needed]
