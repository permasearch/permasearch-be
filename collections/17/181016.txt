The ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions,[214] particularly one related to Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other aspects of pop culture.[215] The website, DidThanosKill.Me was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.[216] The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.[217] Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,[218] including both of the Russos who subscribed.[219] Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying "Here we go, Reddit users," and ending it with a snap.[220] Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted a couple hours.[218] The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.[218][221] Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, r/inthesoulstone.[217][218] One Reddit user who participated felt the ban "embodie[d] the spirit of the Internet" with people "banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious."[221] Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant spoke of the ban and how r/thanosdidnothingwrong "only speaks to how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media."[220]
