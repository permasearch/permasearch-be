The last subcompact station wagon produced in the United States and Canada was the 1992 Toyota Corolla. Compact station wagons have been declining since the 2000s. Ford dropped the Ford Focus ZXW wagon after its 2007 model year, and Subaru replaced the Subaru Impreza wagon with a 5-door hatchback model. Volvo announced that they will withdraw their compact station wagon, the Volvo V50, from the U.S market in 2012 due to poor sales figures. In Europe the V50 remains popular.[30] The VW Golf Sportwagen is Volkswagen's mid-2015 attempt to rectify the absence of a subcompact wagon from any manufacturer in the North American market.
