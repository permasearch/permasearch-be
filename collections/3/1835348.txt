Due to less than successful toy sales, the series' 65 episode run was not extended, and the series ended unresolved. However, according to Straczynski,[1] a movie had also been commissioned along with the series, following in the footsteps of other toy-based animated series such as Transformers and G.I. Joe; if the series had proven successful by increasing toy sales, production would have begun. Straczynski wrote the script, but due to the failure of the toyline, preparation for the movie was shelved.[1]
