Silicone grease is widely used as a temporary sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting ground glass joints, as is typically used in laboratory glassware. Although silicones are normally assumed to be chemically inert, several historically significant compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones.[2][3] The first salts of crown ethers (OSi(CH3)2)n (n = 6, 7) were produced by reactions of organolithium and organopotassium compounds with silicone greases[4] or the serendipitous reaction of stannanetriol with silicone grease to afford a cage-like compound having three Sn-O-Si-O-Sn linkages in the molecule.[5]
