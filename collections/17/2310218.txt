A small, light pale grey tom with white patches like clouds, huge water-blue eyes, thorn-sharp claw tips, and a neat, well-shaped head, Cloudstar was the leader of SkyClan when they were driven from the forest. Cloudstar and his Clan used to live in what is now the Twolegplace and were forced to leave the forest because of human developments over that area, despite asking other Clans for assistance. Cloudstar's mate, Birdflight stayed behind with ThunderClan because of her kits. Cloudstar came into Firestar's dreams to plead for help and to tell him that he must rebuild SkyClan, and also visited the dreams of Firestar's old friend Smudge, whose house is situated over the place where the SkyClan camp used to be. In the end, SkyClan was rebuilt and Cloudstar comes to give Leafstar one of her nine lives and reunites with Birdflight, as well as their kits, Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw. Because of Spottedleaf and Tigerclaw's striking resemblance to Spottedpelt and Gorseclaw, it is believed that they are descended from SkyClan.[51]:91[11]
