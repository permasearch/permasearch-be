The year after the game's release, the game was featured in an episode of How It's Made, in a segment dedicated to video game production.[19] The game has been cited as the reason why the Prince of Persia series, formerly ignored after Prince of Persia 3D, returned to prominence in the gaming world.[4][16][75] In 2004, Mechner began work on a film adaptation, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The film was eventually released in 2010.[89] The success of the game prompted immediate development on a sequel. Titled Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, the game was made aesthetically darker by the team. It released in November 2004.[16][90] Several further sequels set in the continuity of The Sands of Time followed.[16] Aspects of its design, such as the relationship between the Prince and Farah, later provided inspiration for the 2008 series reboot.[91]
