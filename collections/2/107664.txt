James Wallis, a wealthy Bristol Merchant, bought Lucknam and its 100 country acres (0.40 km2) for just £500. This part of the West Country had been long famous for the manufacture of woollen cloth and the Wallis family had been cloth merchants for several generations. James Wallis owned two ships and traded various cargoes to Europe and America. In 1680 he imported 7000 lb of tobacco from Virginia, making a large fortune – which funded his purchase of Lucknam.
