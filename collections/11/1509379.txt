Roethlisberger was one of four quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft along with Philip Rivers, Eli Manning, and J. P. Losman. Due to the trade involving Manning and Rivers, Roethlisberger was the highest-drafted quarterback that year that played for the team that drafted him. Before Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the selection of Roethlisberger, the phone call he received by Steelers head coach Bill Cowher was shown live on ESPN, confirming the team's selection before the official announcement.
