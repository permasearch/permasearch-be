Near the end of the Panic, in 1859, tensions between the North and South regarding the issue of slavery in the United States were increasing. The Panic of 1857 was encouraging to those in the South who believed the North needed the South to keep a stabilized economy and southern threats of secession were temporarily quelled. Southerners believed the Panic of 1857 made the North "more amenable to southern demands" and would help to keep slavery alive in the United States.[23]
