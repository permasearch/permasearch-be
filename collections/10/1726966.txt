The first English settlement occurred about 1642, when 50 Puritan families from the New Haven Colony in Connecticut, led by George Lamberton, tried to establish a theocracy at the mouth of the Schuylkill River. The New Haven Colony had earlier struck a deal with the Lenape to buy much of New Jersey south of present-day Trenton.[9] The Dutch and Swedes in the area burned the English colonists' buildings. A Swedish court under Swedish Governor Johan Bj√∂rnsson Printz convicted Lamberton of "trespassing, conspiring with the Indians."[10] The offshoot New Haven colony received no support. The Puritan Governor John Winthrop said it was dissolved owing to summer "sickness and mortality."[11] The disaster contributed to New Haven's losing control of its area to the larger Connecticut Colony.
