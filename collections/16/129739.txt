After Griffin's departure, the Federal Capital Advisory Committee was established to advise the government of the construction efforts.[119] The Committee had limited success meeting its goals;[117] however, the chairman, John Sulman, was instrumental in applying the ideas of the garden city movement to Griffin's plan.[119] The Committee was replaced in 1925 by the Federal Capital Commission.[120] The role of the FCC was to prepare Canberra for the transfer of the Commonwealth Parliament and the public service from Melbourne to Canberra.[121] The Federal Government officially relocated to the ACT from Melbourne on the formal opening of the Provisional Parliament House on 9 May 1927.[122] Among the new Parliament's first acts was the repeal of the prohibition laws. At first the public service remained based in Melbourne, the various departments' headquarters only gradually moving to Canberra over the space of several years.[123] From 1938 to 1957 the National Capital Planning and Development Committee continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra; however, the NCPDC did not have executive power,[124] and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without the Committee's consultation.[117] A few major buildings were constructed during this period of NCPDC responsibility,[125] such as the Australian War Memorial, which opened in 1941.[126] With the onset of the Great Depression, followed by World WarÂ II, development of the new capital was slow,[127] and in the decade after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village,[127][128] and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly.[129] Canberra was often derisively described as "several suburbs in search of a city".[130] The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies,[131] regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity. Menzies ruled for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly.[132]
