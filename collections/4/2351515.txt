Though not offering a practical realization, this definition would precisely define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of carbon‑12 atoms. Carbon‑12 (12C) is an isotope of carbon. The mole is currently defined as "the quantity of entities (elementary particles like atoms or molecules) equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon‑12". Thus, the current definition of the mole requires that ​1000⁄12 moles (​83 1⁄3 mol) of 12C has a mass of precisely one kilogram. The number of atoms in a mole, a quantity known as the Avogadro constant, is experimentally determined, and the current best estimate of its value is 7023602214085700000♠6.022140857(74)×1023 entities per mole.[73] This new definition of the kilogram proposed to fix the Avogadro constant at precisely 6.02214X×10^23 with the kilogram being defined as "the mass equal to that of ​1000⁄12 ⋅ 6.02214X×10^23 atoms of 12C".
