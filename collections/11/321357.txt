In 2015, two reports on cod fishery recovery offered hopeful and cautionary messages.[25][26] A Canadian scientist reports[27] that in particular areas, cod are increasing in numbers, health, normalising in maturity and behaviour, and offers a promising estimate of increased biomass. However, past assessments of "cod stock" have been greatly overestimated by generalisation beyond areas measured, which was a great part of the incompetent policymaking and mismanagement of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.[19] A US report[28][29] suggests that a failure to consider reduced resilience of cod populations due to increased mortality in warming surface water of the Gulf of Maine has led to overfishing despite regulation. Thus, overestimates of stock biomass due to generalisation of local estimates, and ignorance of environmental factors in growth or recovery potential of a cod fishery will lead to mismanagement and further collapse of stocks, through further unsustainable quotas, as in the past.
