The Naval Service is headed up by Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service (FOCNS) Commodore Hugh Tully who is based at Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Naval Base Haulbowline. NHQ oversees all aspects of the Naval Service, with a number of commands under it: Naval Operations Command (NOC) and Naval Support Command (NSC). The Naval College, like the DFTC is of an equal footing with the two commands, with all three headed up by an Officer Commanding who report directly to the FOCNS of NHQ.
