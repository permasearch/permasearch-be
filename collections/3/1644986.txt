The architect meets Dennis and tells him Ally wants the cheaper option on the re-build. This doesn't go down very well with him as he sees this as a cowboy job.  The following night the lads return from the pub and there are lights on in the house and someone has been in the house. Harry the plumber joins the lads who is a big country and western fan and he invites the lads to his local pub that put on a country and western night. Ally comes up with a plan to buy ex-pats homes for quick cash due to a rumour that Spain will be extraditing all British criminals. Neville goes home for the weekend and Dennis's sister Norma tells Nev about Dennis's debt will Ally Fraser. Upon returning to the Manor, Neville asks Dennis about this and he reveals he owes him six grand. At the country and western bar Wayne pulls a woman and Oz gets up to sing and to the astonishment of the other lads he is very good. When the lads return the "ghost" has been caught by Oz with super glue on the fridge. It turns out it is a tramp.
