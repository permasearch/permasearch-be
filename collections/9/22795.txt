While the word Indian is still a legal term, its use is erratic and in decline in Canada.[19][20] Some First Nations people consider the term offensive, while others prefer it to "Indigenous person/persons/people." The term is a misnomer given to indigenous peoples of North America by European explorers who erroneously thought they had landed on the Indian subcontinent. The use of the term Native Americans, which the US government and others have adopted, is not common in Canada.[15] It refers more specifically to the Indigenous peoples residing within the boundaries of the United States.[21] The parallel term Native Canadian is not commonly used, but Native (in English) and autochtone (in Canadian French; from the Greek auto, own, and chthon, land) are. Under the Royal Proclamation of 1763, also known as the "Indian Magna Carta,"[22] the Crown referred to indigenous peoples in British territory as tribes or nations. The term First Nations is capitalized. Bands and nations may have slightly different meanings.
