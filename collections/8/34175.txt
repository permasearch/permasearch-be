The ARAS is composed of several neuronal circuits connecting the dorsal part of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons to the cerebral cortex via distinct pathways that project through the thalamus and hypothalamus.[2][11][12] The ARAS is a collection of different nuclei â€“ more than 20 on each side in the upper brainstem, the pons, medulla, and posterior hypothalamus. The neurotransmitters that these neurons release include dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, acetylcholine, and glutamate.[2][10][11][12] They exert cortical influence through direct axonal projections and indirect projections through thalamic relays.[11][12][13]
