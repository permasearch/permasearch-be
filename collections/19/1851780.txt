After contemplating on the "complete choir" that is created just by ABBA's voices, Robert Verbeek in his work ABBA & Me says that "even when they are each other’s backing vocals they sound terrific", and ponders on what "The Day Before You Came [would] be without Frida’s background opera-like singing". He describes the song, along with The Winner Takes It All, Eagle, and I’m A Marionette, as "musical masterpieces", which show ABBA's extraordinary growth from its humble origins in simple pop songs like Nina, Pretty Ballerina and Ring Ring.[6]
