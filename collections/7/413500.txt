3D printing, and open source 3D printers in particular, are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom.[95][96][97] Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented "revolution" in STEM education.[98] The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students, but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs.[99] Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment.[99][100]
