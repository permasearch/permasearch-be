Tina remained close to Mick (without knowing that he is really her nephew, rather than her brother). Mick met a local girl called Linda Peacock (Kellie Bright) when he was six years old and they went to school together. When they were 15, Linda fell pregnant by Mick, which upset her father and three months after his death, she gave birth to their son Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard). Two years later, they had a daughter, Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill), followed by the premature birth of their youngest son, Johnny Carter (Sam Strike/Ted Reilly). Shirley burnt down their first pub, which led to Mick being estranged from Shirley and they lived with Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman).
