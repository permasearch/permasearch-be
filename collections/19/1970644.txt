This is a communication-based relationship, therefore, a responsibility to interact, educate, and share information genuinely is placed upon the nurse.[18] The fourth statement of the CNO Standard is, Protecting Clients from Abuse. It is stated that it is the nurse’s job to report abuse of their client to ensure that their client is safe from harm. Nurses must intervene and report any abusive situations observed that might be seen as violent, threatening, or intended to inflict harm. Nurses must also report any health care provider’s behaviors or remarks towards clients that are perceived as romantic, or sexually abusive.[4]
