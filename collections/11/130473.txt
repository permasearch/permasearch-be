Reviewers praised the use of sound in The Last of Us. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that the sound design was significantly better than in other games,[65] while Game Informer's Helgeson dubbed it "amazing".[66] Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added to the effect of the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies.[67] Kelly of Computer and Video Games found that the environmental audio positively impacted gameplay, and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was "sparse and delicate".[63] Both Game Informer's Helgeson and Destructoid's Sterling called the score "haunting",[66] with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay.[76]
