The Mk Vb Spitfire, AB910, escorted convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic. She then flew escort patrols during bombing raids on the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, then (as part of No. 133 squadron), she fought in the Dieppe Raid. Capping this long career, as part of No. 402 Squadron RCAF, she flew cover patrols over the Normandy beaches on D-Day and in the subsequent weeks â€“ as did another of the flight's Spitfires, with No. 443 Squadron RCAF. AB910 now[when?] wears the 133 squadron codes 'MD-E' which she actually wore during the Dieppe Raid.
