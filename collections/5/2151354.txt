A teratoma is a tumor made up of several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, or bone.[4] They typically form in the ovaries, testicles, or tailbone and less commonly in other areas.[4] Symptoms may be minimal if the tumor is small.[2] A testicular teratoma may present as a painless lump.[1] Complications may include ovarian torsion, testicular torsion, or hydrops fetalis.[3][1][2]
