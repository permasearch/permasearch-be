One of the features advertised for Napoleon was a uniform editor. Upon release The Creative Assembly announced that the uniform editor would be delayed; while it was not advertised "on the box", it was advertised as a feature by all online retailers (including Steam) and the official game website. Five months after Napoleon: Total War's release, mention of the uniform editor was removed from the game's list of features on its official website; it is, however, still being advertised on most online retailers selling the game. Almost eight months after the game's release, Mike Simpson stated that the original uniform editor was never meant for public use, and that The Creative Assembly was making a unit editor capable of both editing and creating new units. This new unit editor was scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2011.[17] To date no further reference to the uniform editor has been made and it is now seen by fans as unlikely to be released in the future.
