According to Lucie Arnaz, who was interviewed on the TV show Archive of American Television he became like part of the family. "Desi considered him his best friend and was responsible for teaching him the drums. He came over our house on many weekends and traveled with them during the summer. My mother kind of adopted him. He is in all of our home movies and photograph's and was a great kid and still is." [EmmyTVLegends.org]
