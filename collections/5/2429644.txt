SkyDome, called Rogers Centre since 2005, was designed by architect Rod Robbie and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed by the EllisDon Construction company of London, Ontario and the Dominion Bridge Company of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium's construction lasted about two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost of construction was C$570 million[7] ($978 million in 2016 dollars[15]) which was paid for by the federal government, Ontario provincial government, the City of Toronto, and a large consortium of corporations.[16]
