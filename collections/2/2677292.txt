All sightings in the wild were of single dogs or pairs.[24] Some dogs are more comfortable in pairs and others in small groups, but based on singing dogs in captivity, it has been inferred that wild singing dogs do not form permanent packs.[26] Flanneryâ€™s short 1988 report on dogs in the mountains of Papua New Guinea is regarded as the only available report on direct observation of wild specimens. He described them as "extraordinarily shy" and "almost preternaturally canny".[27] According to Robert Bino (a student from the University of Papua New Guinea), these dogs use their resting places under roots and ledges in New Guinea only sporadically. Bino theorized that these dogs are highly mobile and forage alone and concluded that they therefore might use several hiding places in their home range.[28]
