Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and of the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.[107][108] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.[109] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Prize and the Hughes Medal.[110][111] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977.[112] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.[113][109]
