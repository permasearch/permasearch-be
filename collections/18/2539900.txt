The hotel was named after the Eden Roc pavilion at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France. The hotel housed the Cafe Pompei, a supper club that offered entertainment with dinner. The Mona Lisa Room was an intimate formal dining room, and Harry's American Bar was the hotel's nightclub (not named after the hotel owner, Harry Mufson, but rather a famous bar â€“ considered by many an institution - in Venice, Italy, and a name Morris Lapidus borrowed for the storied nightclub within the Eden Roc).[3]
