In 1999, Hart provided the voice of Sabrina's two aunts for Sabrina: The Animated Series. This series lasted one season and produced 65 episodes, the television/direct-to-video movie Sabrina: Friends Forever, and the continuation-spinoff series Sabrina's Secret Life. Both of Sabrina animated shows and a movie are all produced by DiC Productions, now called DHX Media.
