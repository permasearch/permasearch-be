The most common cloth used by library binders to cover the boards of the book is buckram coated with acrylic. Acrylic coatings are generally resistant to water, mold, insects, and ultra-violet light. The buckram used is a 100% cotton, bulky fabric designed to withstand wear and tear (Jones 1993).  Smaller books may be bound in c-cloth, a lighter weight cloth that may or may not have an acrylic coating.  The information about the volume (such as title and call number) is hot-stamped onto the spine.  Bound serials are typically all bound in the same color of buckram, in order to indicate the relationship of the volumes.
