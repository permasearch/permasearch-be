For Sunnis, after the Qur'an the most widely accepted and famous collection of traditions is Sahih al-Bukhari. Imam Bukhari, the author of the book is said to have spent over 16 years gathering over 1,600,000 traditions and finding the best 7,397 of them. Most of these traditions deal with the life of Muhammad.[14]
