The British and Irish sort codes are only used for domestic money transfers.[citation needed] If money is being transferred across international borders, an international network is used. At the beginning of 2014 all European countries using the euro switched to the IBAN as a means of identifying bank accounts and previously used coding systems such as the BLZ, BIC and even account numbers are not in use anymore. However, transfers to, amongst others, the United States and Australia make use of the BIC codes. Characters 9 to 14 of British and Irish IBANs hold the bank account sort code.[10]
