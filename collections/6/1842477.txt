Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.[citation needed] They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.[59]
