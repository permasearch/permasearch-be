In the myth Pluto abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm.[66] Pluto (Πλούτων, Ploutōn) was a name for the ruler of the underworld; the god was also known as Hades, a name for the underworld itself. The name Pluton was conflated with that of Ploutos (Πλούτος Ploutos, "wealth"), a god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because Pluto as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.[67] Plouton is lord of the dead, but as Persephone's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility.[68]
