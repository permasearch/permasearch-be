The number of Central Committee meetings rose again during Brezhnev's early tenure as elected First Secretary,[51] but the number of meetings and their duration steadily decreased during Brezhnev's rule.[73] Before Stalin's consolidation of power, the Central Committee featured open debate, where even leading officials could be criticised.[74] This did not occur during the Brezhnev era, and Politburo officials rarely participated in its meetings; from 1966 to 1976, Alexei Kosygin, Podgorny and Mikhail Suslov attended a Central Committee meeting once; it was in 1973 to ratify the Soviet Union's treaty with West Germany.[74] No Politburo or Secretariat members during the Brezhnev era were speakers during Central Committee meetings.[74] The speaker at the Central Committee meeting which elected the Council of Ministers (the Government) and the Politburo was never listed during the Brezhnev era.[74] Because the average duration of a Central Committee meeting decreased, and fewer meetings were held, many Central Committee members were unable to speak.[75] Some members consulted the leadership beforehand, to ask to speak during meetings.[75] During the May 1966 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev openly complained that only one member had asked him personally to be allowed to speak.[75] The majority of speakers at Central Committee plenums were high-standing officials.[75]
