In crafting the character of Leo McGarry, series creator Aaron Sorkin said he envisioned John Spencer in the part but had not imagined he would be available.[1] Although he had recently decided he did not want to do another TV drama series due to the long hours, Spencer was so impressed by the pilot script that he took the part.[2] Like the character, Spencer was a recovering alcoholic, and said he found he could relate to McGarry because "Leo's in recovery, too."[3]
