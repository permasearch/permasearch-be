The buildings in Duddingston Road were demolished between January and June 2017 in preparation for the construction of a new building for St John's Primary School. Once the new building is occupied, the old St John's will be demolished and the site made into the Treverlen public park [14]to replace the park land used to build the new Portobello High School on Milton Road.
