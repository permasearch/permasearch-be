The London Gateway container port on the Essex side of the Thames Estuary was developed on the old Shell Haven site and will have, when fully complete, 6 deep-water berths capable of docking the next generation of ultra large container ships.[27][28] The Port of Tilbury is also located on the Thames Estuary, to the west of London Gateway.
