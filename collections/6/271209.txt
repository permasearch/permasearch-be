Azerbaijan also strictly bans any visit by foreign citizens to the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh[626] (the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh), its surrounding territories and the Azerbaijani exclaves of Karki, Yuxarı Əskipara, Barxudarlı and Sofulu which are de jure part of Azerbaijan but under control of Armenia, without the prior consent of the government of Azerbaijan. Foreign citizens who enter these occupied territories will be permanently banned from entering the Republic of Azerbaijan[627] and will be included in their "list of personae non gratae".[628] As of April 2018 the list contains 710 persons.
