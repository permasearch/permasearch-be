Over her relatively short life, Virginia Woolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than five hundred essays and reviews,[217] some of which, like A Room of One's Own (1929) were of book length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death, Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays,[336] published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave,[337] and several more volumes of essays followed, such as The Captain's death bed: and other essays (1950).[338]
