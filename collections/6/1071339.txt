The music video made its U.S. television debut on Solid Gold on January 31, 1981,[4] and not only became the first rap video ever broadcast on MTV, but was part of its first 90-video rotation.[5] Set in the East Village section of Manhattan, the "Man from Mars" or "voodoo god" (dancer William Barnes in the white suit and top hat) is the introductory and central figure. Barnes also choreographed the piece.[6] Much of the video is a one-take scene of Debbie Harry dancing along the street, passing by graffiti artists, Uncle Sam, an American Indian and a goat. Fab Five Freddy and graffiti artists Lee Quinones and Jean-Michel Basquiat make cameo appearances. Basquiat was hired when Grandmaster Flash did not show for the filming.[7] The UK 7" version of the song is used in the video.
