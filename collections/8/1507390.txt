By 1960, Ahmedabad had become a metropolis with a population of slightly under half a million people, with classical and colonial European-style buildings lining the city's thoroughfares.[37] It was chosen as the capital of Gujarat state after the partition of the State of Bombay on 1 May 1960.[38] During this period, a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city, making it a centre for higher education, science and technology.[39] Ahmedabad's economic base became more diverse with the establishment of heavy and chemical industry during the same period. Many countries sought to emulate India's economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea, copied the city's second "Five-Year Plan".[citation needed]
