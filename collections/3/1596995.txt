Jersey Cash 5 began on September 30, 1992 as a pick-5-of-38 game. Players won a parimutuel prize by matching at least three numbers. The original version of Jersey Cash 5 did not have a rolling jackpot; instead, if no set of five numbers was a perfect match, the first-prize pool was added to second prize winners (those who matched four of five numbers.) In September 2003, two numbers were added to make Jersey Cash 5 a 5/40 game, and the top prize level was changed to a progressive jackpot.[5] On September 14, 2014, Jersey Cash 5 increased its field of numbers from 40 to 43. Now a 5/43 game, its estimated starting jackpot prize was also increased - from $50,000 to $75,000.[7]
