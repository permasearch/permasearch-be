Boussinesq[11] derived the velocity profile and volume flow rate in 1868 for rectangular channel and tubes of equilateral triangular cross-section and for elliptical cross-section. Proudman[12] derived the same for isosceles triangles in 1914. Let     G = âˆ’ d p  /  d x =  constant    {\displaystyle G=-dp/dx={\text{constant}}}   be the constant pressure gradient acting in direction parallel to the motion.
