Marini was cast in a guest appearance in the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation as Brandi Maxxxx, a pornographic film actress. Marini had previously participated in a workshop with Dorian Frankel, the show's casting director, before auditioning for the Brandi Maxxxx role. Marini was concerned she didnâ€™t do her best at the audition, but was nevertheless chosen for the role.[2] She first appeared in the third season episode "Jerry's Painting", which originally aired on April 28, 2011.[2] In the episode, Brandi appears on a television news program along with Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) in which Leslie is defending a painting that depicts her as a centaur with her breasts exposed. While Leslie defends the artistic merit of the painting, Brandi defends the painting while simultaneously comparing it to pornography, unwittingly undermining Leslie's arguments.[9] Marini later reprised the role in the fourth season episode "The Debate", where Brandi Maxxxx ran for city council against Leslie and participated in a political debate against Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd) and two other candidates.[2][10]
