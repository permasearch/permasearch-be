The origin of the word truffle appears to be the Latin term tūber, meaning "swelling" or "lump", which became tufer- and gave rise to the various European terms: Croatian tartuf / тартуф, Danish trøffel, Dutch truffel, English truffle, French truffe, German Trüffel, Italian tartufo, Polish trufla, Romanian trufă, Spanish trufa, and Swedish tryffel.
