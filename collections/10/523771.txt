The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party–giving rise to the Conservatives' colloquial name of Tories–and was one of two dominant political parties in the nineteenth century, along with the Liberal Party. During the 1890s, it formed a coalition government with the Liberal Unionist Party, a break-away faction of the Liberal Party. In 1912, the two parties merged to form the current Conservative and Unionist Party. In the 1920s, the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party became the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the twentieth century, including Winston Churchill (1940–45, 1951–55) and Margaret Thatcher (1979–90). Thatcher's tenure led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation. The Conservative Party's domination of British politics throughout the twentieth century has led to them being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world.[14][15]
