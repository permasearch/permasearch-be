Sebum, secreted by the sebaceous gland in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (≈41%), wax esters (≈26%), squalene (≈12%), and free fatty acids (≈16%).[6][14] The composition of sebum varies across species.[14] Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products anywhere else in the body.[4] Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne.[15] Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.[16]
