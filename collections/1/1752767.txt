Work Completed: The van was stripped down and sandblasted to reveal how bad the damage was. The van was given a new lease of life with new paint in the original white colour and the logo was repainted on the sides. Due to the van being in constant use over the years the rust had damaged all parts, Ant had to hand bend and weld bespoke panel pieces to the van.
