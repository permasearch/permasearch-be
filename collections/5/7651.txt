weather= 39 °F (Light rain) After their scoring fest in Week 10, the Eagles and Dallas Cowboys played a defensive struggle in a Week 15 game that would mean home-field advantage throughout the playoffs if the Eagles were to win. The teams had long drives, but could not get into field goal range in the first quarter. In the second, the Eagles broke through with a drive capped by a 2-yard touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb to Chad Lewis. David Akers missed the extra point, making it a 6–0 game. McNabb was later sacked and fumbled the ball away to Dallas, with Vinny Testaverde taking advantage by firing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson. The missed extra point now seemed more critical as the Eagles trailed 7–6 going into halftime. On the opening drive of the third quarter, McNabb found his favorite target, Terrell Owens for a 20-yard gain, but Dallas safety Roy Williams, made a horse-collar tackle on Owens, breaking his ankle. The play would prompt a new NFL rule the next season, barring horse-collar tackles. McNabb was intercepted two plays later and again later in the quarter as neither offense could score. Cowboys kicker Billy Cundiff missed a 46-yarder in the fourth quarter, giving the Eagles new life. McNabb, going back to one of his old tricks in the absence of Owens, made scrambles of 12 yards and 19 yards, setting up an eventual Dorsey Levens touchdown run from 2-yards out. The two-point conversion failed and it remained 12–7 Eagles. However, Lito Sheppard picked off Testaverde on the next series to end the game. Proving again that they could win a close game, the Eagles prevailed under adversity and in improving their record to 13–1, completed a sweep of their NFC East opponents while locking up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Unfortunately, the word after the game was that Owens, the Eagles' sharpest offensive weapon, would be out until at least the Super Bowl.
