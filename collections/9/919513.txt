In its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding Huari empire.  The Cerro Blanco site of Huaca del Sol appears to have been the Moche capital.  Largely destroyed by natural events around 600 CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters.[63]
