However, the evidence for this hypothesis has not always been straightforward and the model proposed by Kondrashov has been criticized for assuming mutation parameters far from real world observations.[41] In addition, in those tests which used artificial gene networks, negative epistasis is only found in more densely connected networks,[16] whereas empirical evidence indicates that natural gene networks are sparsely connected,[42] and theory shows that selection for robustness will favor more sparsely connected and minimally complex networks.[42]
