"Party" was officially remixed with vocals from American rapper J. Cole, replacing those of André 3000. The verses of André 3000 were supplanted by those from Cole; all other elements of the remix are identical to the original. His rap is much shorter than that of André 3000. In his verse, Cole thanks God and Ice Cube for Friday, references Sade and Petey Pablo and name-drops the Bugatti brand. Cole revealed that he was originally supposed to appear on the album version and that Beyoncé later enlisted him to appear on the official "Party" remix. It was released worldwide as a digital download on October 24, 2011 as a single.
