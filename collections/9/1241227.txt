Women “all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances”[20]; be it age, skin tone, or size. Men are falling victims to this issue as well. A large facet of “social currency for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance”[17]. With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look; social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements, also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate commodity, and used for the selling of products[21]. The ultimate purpose of advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fuelling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems, are more likely to purchase. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.
