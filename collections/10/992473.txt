Feng, Elizabeth, and Barbossa are interrupted by the East India Trading Company, lead by Mr. Mercer.[3] During the battle, Feng and Will confront each other while Mercer secretly listens in. Will tells Feng that if he wishes to make a deal with the E.I.T.C. then he needs what Will offers â€” the two strike a deal. Will wants the Black Pearl to free his father from Davy Jones. In exchange, Feng can have Jack Sparrow to barter to the East India Trading Company for his own freedom. Feng agrees and provides Will with a ship and crew, then covers Will and the others' escape from Singapore. Unbeknownst to Will, however, Feng makes his own deal with the East India Trading Company to turn over all the pirates, including Will, in exchange for the Black Pearl and his own freedom.
