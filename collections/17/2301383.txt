Chelsea, Barbara, and Bob visit the SS Tipton. Cody is worried about how he's going to tell Barbara about his feelings for Bailey, but Barbara has to dump Cody because she and Bob are now dating. Right before Cody tells her about Bailey, Barbara tells him about her and Bob. To make Barbara jealous, Cody tells her that he and Bailey are also dating, thinking he can get away with the lie because Bailey is off the ship, only for her to return early. London tells Chelsea that her cabin is her shoe closet, and that Woody is her servant. Woody agrees to help her because he has a crush on Chelsea. During movie night, Cody tries to make Barbara think that he and Bailey are dating, but Bailey eventually finds out. Cody apologizes and Bailey forgives him and says if he wanted her to be his pretend girlfriend, all he had to do is ask. To show it, she tickles him, wraps her arms around him, and finishes with a kiss on the cheek (causing Cody to faint) saying that would have made Barbara really jealous. Chelsea finds out that London is just a regular student, but instead of telling everyone, tells London she will tell everyone that London was "abducted by aliens" instead. Bob also apologizes to Zack for never getting to spend any time with him.
