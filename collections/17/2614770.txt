Researchers use language deficits seen in the aphasic population to draw conclusions about the psycholinguistic models of language including message formation, lexical selection and morphosyntactic encoding. Cho-Reyes, Mack & Thomson (2016) discovered that patients with aphasia access syntactic representations, including thematic representations, during sentence production, similarly to the typically developing cohorts.  Also, because the participants showed lasting priming effects, the incorporation of structural priming within treatment is hypothesized to aid production of complex structured utterances[13] (Cho-Reyes, Mack & Thompson, 2016, p. 213).
