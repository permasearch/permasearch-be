SpaceX plans to launch its Dragon 2 spacecraft on an uncrewed test flight to the ISS in August 2018, and in December 2018, a crewed Dragon will send US astronauts to the ISS for the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle.[106] In February 2017 SpaceX announced that two would-be space tourists had put down "significant deposits" for a mission which would see the two private astronauts fly on board a Dragon capsule around the moon and back again.
