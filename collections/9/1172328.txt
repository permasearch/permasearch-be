The non-geographic postcode XX10 1DD is currently used by Amazon.com to direct customer-returned items carried by Royal Mail to its Fulfilment Centre in Dunfermline, Scotland.[6] XX10 1AA appears to be in use for the same purpose by ASOS.com, although when questioned by numerous customers in 2016 and 2017, staff manning their Facebook page seemed to know nothing of it.[7] John Lewis returns also use the XX postcode. (XX10 1EE)
