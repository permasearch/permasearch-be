Mysteries at the Museum is a successful series, and spawned a spin-off from its Monumental Mysteries: A Mysteries at the Museum Special called Monumental Mysteries. Monumental Mysteries and two other Travel Channel series called Hotel Secrets & Legends and Castle Secrets & Legends have been renamed Mysteries at the Monument, Mysteries at the Hotel, and Mysteries at the Castle, respectively, to capitalize on the Mysteries at the Museum name.[citation needed] A conspiracy show called Mysteries at the National Parks has also been developed and broadcast. The show also spawned a series of specials such as the Greatest Mysteries specials.[citation needed]
