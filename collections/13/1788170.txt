Epilepsy may occur as a result of a number of other conditions including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth.[28][29] Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases.[49] The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly.[49] Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 40–60%.[49] Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy.[49] In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly.[24][49] Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma.[49] Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold.[49] In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.[49]
