Some alkaline batteries are designed to be recharged (see rechargeable alkaline battery), but most are not. Attempts to recharge may cause rupture, or the leaking of hazardous liquids which will corrode the equipment. However, attempts at recharging alkaline cells a highly limited number of times (10 or fewer times with reduced capacity after each charge) are reported and chargers are available commercially. Recent research has shown the possibility of recharging at a very high energy density.[10][11] Gautam G. Yadav discovered the rechargeability of manganese dioxide to its theoretical second electron capacity for over 6000 cycles in alkaline batteries by intercalating the interlayers by copper ions.[10] The energy density (>160Wh/L) of these rechargeable batteries with copper intercalated manganese dioxides is reported to be the best among the aqueous-based chemistries.[11] It is also capable of energy densities (>250Wh/L) comparable to lithium-ion if zinc utilization in the batteries is improved.[10]
