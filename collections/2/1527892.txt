The word moped was coined by the Swedish journalist Harald Nielsen in 1952, as a portmanteau of the Swedish words "motor" and "pedaler". The claimed derivation from the term motor-velocipede is incorrect.[1][2] According to Douglas Harper, the Swedish terms originated from "(trampcykel med) mo(tor och) ped(aler)", which means "pedal cycle with engine and pedals" (the earliest versions had auxiliary pedals).[3] Like some of the earliest two wheeled motorcycles, all mopeds were once equipped with bicycle pedals.
