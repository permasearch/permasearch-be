Only small number (0.5-5%) of sporozoites enter the blood stream into the liver. In the liver, the activated CD8+ T cells from the lymph bind the sporozoites through the circumsporozoite protein (CSP).[51] Antigen presentation by dendritic cells in the skin tissue to T cells is also a crucial process. From this stage onward the parasites produce different proteins that help in suppressing communication of the immune cells.[53] Even at the height of the infection when RBCs are ruptured, the immune signals are not strong enough to activate macropages or natural killer cells.[54]
