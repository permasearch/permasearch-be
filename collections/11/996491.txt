On October 19, 2014, against the San Francisco 49ers on NBC Sunday Night Football, Manning threw his 509th career touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas, passing Brett Favre to become the NFL's all-time leader in passing touchdowns.[232] By the end of the regular season, Manning would be selected to his 14th Pro Bowl appearance, tying him with Tony Gonzalez, Bruce Matthews, and Merlin Olsen for most Pro Bowl selections in a career. However, his season ended after the Broncos lost in the Divisional Round of the playoffs to his former team, the Colts, 24â€“13.[233]
