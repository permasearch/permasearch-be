On November 25, 2015, Griffin recorded season highs with 40 points and 12 rebounds in a loss to the Utah Jazz, with the Clippers dropping to 7–8 after starting the season 4–0.[95] On December 26, he was ruled out indefinitely with a partially torn left quadriceps.[96] While expected to return to action on January 26, Griffin was instead ruled out for an estimated four to six weeks due to a right hand injury he sustained on January 23 from hitting a member of the team's equipment staff, who was also his friend, during an argument at a restaurant in Toronto.[97][98] The Clippers were sternly critical of Griffin, and indicated that further punitive action would follow.[98] According to the Toronto Police Service, a police report was not filed.[99]
