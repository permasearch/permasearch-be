The comma ( , ) is a punctuation mark that appears in several variants in various languages. It has the same shape as an apostrophe, or single closing quotation mark in many typefaces, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in numeral 9.
