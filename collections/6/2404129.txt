In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner.[1] In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly usedâ€”unless a distinction needs to be made between people with the same surname. The idioms "on a first-name basis" and "being on first-name terms" refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.[1]
