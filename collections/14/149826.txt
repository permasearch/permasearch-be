Thoreau never married and was childless. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan. However, his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual.[67][68] There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual.[67][69][70] The elegy Sympathy was inspired by the eleven-year-old Edmund Sewell, with whom he hiked for five days in 1839.[71] One scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to Edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to Edmund's sister,[72] and another that Thoreau's "emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns",[73] but other scholars dismiss this.[67][74] It has been argued that the long paean in Walden to the French-Canadian woodchopper Alek Therien, which includes allusions to Achilles and Patroclus, is an expression of conflicted desire.[75] In some of Thoreau's writing there is the sense of a secret self.[76] In 1840 he writes in his journal: "My friend is the apology for my life. In him are the spaces which my orbit traverses".[77] Thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time, and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire.[78]
