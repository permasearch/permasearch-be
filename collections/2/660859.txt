The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific tertiary structure. The scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary structural elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable "domains" of secondary structure like hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops.[21] Since RNA is charged, metal ions such as Mg2+ are needed to stabilise many secondary and tertiary structures.[22]
