Devils are found in all habitats on the island of Tasmania, including the outskirts of urban areas, and are distributed throughout the Tasmanian mainland and on Robbins Island (which is connected to mainland Tasmania at low tide).[60] The north-western population is located west of the Forth River and as far south as Macquarie Heads.[1] Previously, they were present on Bruny Island from the 19th century, but there have been no records of them after 1900,[1] and they were introduced to Badger Island in the mid-1990s but are thought to have died out by 2005.[36] A study has modelled the reintroduction of DFTD-free Tasmanian devils to the mainland in areas where dingoes are sparse. It is proposed that devils would have fewer impacts on both livestock and native fauna than dingoes, and that the mainland population could act as an additional insurance population.[61] In September 2015, 20 immunised captive-bred devils were released into Narawntapu National Park, Tasmania.[62] Two later died from being hit by cars.[63]
