It is a high floodplain with a gentle slope to the east, and experiences relatively little rainfall (400Â mm/year). Some areas are flooded occasionally, during which time the appearance of species adapted to such an environment is seen. The soils in the region are salty, and their use is limited because of their aridity. The Chaco is irrigated by the rivers Pilcomayo and Paraguay, both of which sprout many tributaries.
