Bungie and Microsoft first showed ODST in a playable form at E3 2009, where the game's release date and retail versions were finalized. Bungie initially marketed ODST as a title smaller in scope than previous numbered entries in the series. When the game's retail versions were announced, however, the game received a standard price of US$60, which Bungie and Microsoft attributed to the game growing beyond the planned scope. "Over the course of development it got a lot bigger than we were anticipating," said Bungie's Lars Bakken. "We thought of it more as an expansion and then it grew well beyond that."[64] Creamer explained that since the development platform was stable, "we were able to create quite a bit more content than we originally thought we would".[65] The game's length increased from original estimates of 3–5 hours to 8–10.[66] The discrepancy was not discussed until E3 2009 when Microsoft decided it was a full game.[64] Unlike the post-launch support for Halo 3, ODST does not have downloadable content.[67]
