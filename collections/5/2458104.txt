Inconsistencies have been pointed out by critics and skeptics,[17] presenting as difficulties the different numbers and names for the same feature and different sequences for what is supposed to be the same event. Responses to these criticisms include the modern documentary hypothesis, two-source hypothesis (in various guises), and assertions that the Pastoral Epistles are pseudonymous. Contrasting with these critical stances are positions supported by traditionalists, considering the texts to be consistent, with the Torah written by a single source,[18][19] but the Gospels by four independent witnesses,[20] and all of the Pauline Epistles, except possibly the Hebrews, as having been written by Paul the Apostle.
