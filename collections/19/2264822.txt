Ayahs 1-3: These ayahs are talking about how Allah (S) created human beings from Alaq (clay). After this ayah was revealed, Muhammed (S) responded by saying that he didn’t know how to read. After angel Jibraeel squeezed Muhammed’s chest a few times, and the 3rd ayah was revealed, Muhammed (S) read even though he did not know how to read or write. Ayahs 4-5: These ayah stress the importance of an education for a Muslim. As time goes on, things progress and advance, and everything comes from Allah (S). Allah (S) opens peoples brains to new things, and this ayah stresses the importance of furthering your education. This hadeeth in relation to this ayah was revealed which says: “a person who reads is handsome in the eyes of Allah (S).” Ayah 6-8: Even though Allah (S) does so many things for us we still disobey him. Some people say that they do not need Allah (S). It does not matter because everyone will return back to him on the Day of Judgement. Ayahs 9-10: In this ayah “the one who discourages” references Abu Jahl when he tried to stop Muhammed (S) from making devotions towards Allah (S), and anyone else for that matter. Ayahs 11-14: These ayahs question whether the “one who discourages” is being “guided” or even “concerned” about god. They also emphasize that if someone is praying not to stop them because Allah (S) is always watching. Ayahs 15-19: These ayahs explain why the person who interrupts someone in prayer is said that they will be draged from their “lying, sinful, forehead.” This phrase comes from Abu Jahl, who in the battle of Badr was killed by the hands of 2 child orphans of Medinah. His body was thrown into a well and they dragged him by his hair, which is specifically in reference to ayah 15.
