Juan Cortina was born in Camargo, Tamaulipas, the son of EstÃ©fana Goseacochea and Trinidad Cortina, a wealthy cattle-ranching family. When he was 3, his family moved to the Rio Grande Valley, as his mother had inherited vast tracts of land in the area surrounding Matamoros and Brownsville. In 1846, at age 22, he joined the Mexican Army under the orders of Gen. Mariano Arista, who had arrived at Matamoros in an attempt to stop the advancing forces of Gen. Zachary Taylor. Arista asked Cortina to form a force from the local Vaqueros (Mexican antecedent of Cowboys) who worked for him and the nearby ranches. This irregular cavalry regiment (called the "Tamaulipas") was placed under his command, and as the Mexican-American War began, it took part in the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.
