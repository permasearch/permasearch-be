Although the One Big Union organisations frequently formed with the help of IWW members or members of IWW offshoot-organisations such as the WIIU, the OBU organisations frequently incurred criticism from the original industrial union organisations.[57] The IWW advocated organizing bottom-up, the OBU in Australia operated increasingly top-down. The IWW advocated job control, the Australian OBU did not.[57] Shop committees and rank and file participation which had been so important to IWW members were de-emphasised.[35] The OBU in Australia was described as "the plum extracted from the IWW cake to keep down discontent among the dupes".[56]
