Khmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels, but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect (Western Khmer).[9] The distinction arose historically when vowels after Old Khmer voiced consonants became breathy voiced and diphthongized; for example *kaa, *ɡaa became *kaa, *ɡe̤a. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel (*kaa, *ke̤a); later the phonation disappeared as well ([kaː], [kiə]).[34] These processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the Khmer script.
