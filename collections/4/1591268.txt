Similarly in Greek mythology, the world was surrounded by Oceanus, the world-ocean of classical antiquity. Oceanus was personified as the god Titan, whose consort was the aquatic sea goddess Tethys.[76] It was also thought that rainfall was due a third ocean above the "Firmament of the Sky" (a vast reservoir above the firmament of the sky is also described in the Genesis creation narrative). A comprehensive understanding of the Earth's water cycle did not exist until the "Origins of Springs" was written by Pierre Perrault in 1674 AD.
