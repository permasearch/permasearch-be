Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging.[2] Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time.[2] Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed.[2] This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives.[2] Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise.[2][4] Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight.[1] The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth.[2] Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol.[2] There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.[3]
