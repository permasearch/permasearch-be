Immanuel (Hebrew: עִמָּנוּאֵל‬ meaning, "God with us"; also romanized Emmanuel, Imanu'el) is a Hebrew name which appears in the Book of Isaiah as a sign that God will protect the House of David.[1] The Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 1:22–23) quotes part of this, "a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel", as a prophecy of the birth of the Messiah and the fulfillment of Scripture in the person of Jesus.[2]
