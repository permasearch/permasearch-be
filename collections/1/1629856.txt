Similar to TALENs, Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) are used to create a double stranded break in the DNA at a specific locus in the genome.[23] The ZFN editing complex consists of a zinc finger protein (ZFP) and a restriction enzyme cleavage domain.[25] The ZNP domain can be altered to change the DNA sequence that the restriction enzyme cuts, and this cleavage event initiates cellular repair processes, similar to that of CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing.[25]
