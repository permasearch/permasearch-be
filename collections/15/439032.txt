Jasmine Delaney (also Delany),[33] played by Sam Frost, made her first appearance on 18 December 2017. Frost's casting was announced on 17 July 2017.[34] She was asked to audition for the show while she was appearing on Hell's Kitchen Australia. Frost did not think she would win the role, after going up against several actresses, but she was told that she had secured the part after a second audition.[35] Frost commented "I grew up watching Home and Away and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be on set and part of the cast."[35] The role marks Frost's acting debut.[35] Frost's casting attracted criticism from some actors, who dubbed it a publicity stunt.[36] The artistic director of the Australian Acting Academy, Brendan Glanville admitted that he was "disappointed" by the casting, saying "To me it demonstrates that Home and Away has lost faith in its writers if directors are resorting to this kind of stunt, rather than using their storylines to pull viewers. I can't comment on Sam Frost's acting because some people have a natural ability, but this is a non-artistic choice that is disappointing."[36]
