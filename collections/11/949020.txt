A telephone booth appeared in the house for Kathy's BB Takeover, and she told the HouseGuests about the Last Laugh twist. Da'Vonne answered the seventh call and earned the power to stop three of the HouseGuests from voting in the upcoming eviction, which meant that she only needed five votes to survive the eviction. Da'Vonne and Jason suspected that Liz had been playing with a twin and alerted the other HouseGuests. Da'Vonne tried to use this information as leverage to secure Liz's vote. At the live eviction, Da'Vonne used the power of the Last Laugh to stop Becky, Jackie, and Jeff from voting, but it didn't matter, as she was evicted anyway after everyone except Audrey and Jason voted against her, and she became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski kicked off his BB Takeover, Gronk's Party Week, by announcing that there would be no Have-Nots that week.
