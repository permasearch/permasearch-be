Batman pursues Joker to the edge of a large drop. Batman claims that he knows Joker's true identity. As Batman threatens to whisper it in his ear, Joker jumps over the edge and falls out of sight, his face separated from him. Batman finds a notebook which Joker claimed held the secret identities of the Bat-family, but discovers it is blank. Meanwhile, the Bat-family are gassed into attacking each other, but manage to fight off the gas' influence. Later, in Wayne Manor, Batman tells a recovering Alfred that after finding the joker playing card in the cave, he confronted Joker about it in Arkham Aslyum as Bruce Wayne. Joker failed to acknowledge him and Batman realized that he did not care who Batman was under his mask. The members of the Bat-family refuse to meet with Batman. Later, Batman studies the chemical makeup of the gas Joker used on the Bat-family, and finds an inert isotope; the chemical compound "Ha".[13]
