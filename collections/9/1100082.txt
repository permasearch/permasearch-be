"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans" (sometimes "Black and Tan") is an Irish rebel song referring to the Black and Tans, the British paramilitary police auxiliary force in Ireland during the 1920s. The song was written by Dominic Behan as a tribute to his father Stephen although authorship of the song is often attributed to Stephen. The melody was adapted from an old air, Rosc Catha na Mumhan (Irish for Battlecry of Munster) by Piaras Mac Gearailt (Pierce FitzGerald c.1709-c.1792), which is also used for the loyalist song, The Boyne Water, as well as several other songs in English and Irish.
