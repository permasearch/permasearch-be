In the 2006 season, Backe was the Astros No. 4 starter. But after two starts he went onto the disabled list for three months. He returned in late July, but on August 19 he sprained a ligament in his right elbow was placed on the disabled list again. This injury required Tommy John surgery, which was successfully performed on September 7, 2006.
