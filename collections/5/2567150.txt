After World War II, with the economy recovering, demand for both libraries and knowledgeable library professionals greatly increased and the need for more widely available library education began to increase within library associations across the prairies.  In 1965 the University of Alberta Board of Governors at last decided to create a library school at its Edmonton Campus.[3] The plan for the new School of Library Science was completed in 1966, and the first students began the Bachelor of Library Science(BLS) program in 1968.[4]
