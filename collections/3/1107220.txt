Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,[41] and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier[42] date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but also note that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.
