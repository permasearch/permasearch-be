People with Addison's are often advised to carry information on them (e.g., in the form of a MedicAlert bracelet or information card) for the attention of emergency medical services personnel who might need to attend to their needs.[21][22] It is also recommended that a needle, syringe, and injectable form of cortisol be carried for emergencies.[22] People with Addison's disease are advised to increase their medication during periods of illness or when undergoing surgery or dental treatment.[22] Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occur, as these conditions can precipitate an Addisonian crisis. A patient who is vomiting may require injections of hydrocortisone instead.[23]
