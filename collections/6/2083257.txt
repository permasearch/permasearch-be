"In the Pale Moonlight" considers a similar moral dilemma when the Dominion captures an important Federation planet, Betazed, in a surprise attack. The subjugation of a planet familiar to the audience was used to heighten the sense of danger and the stakes for the characters.[58] In this episode, Sisko fuels a conspiracy intended to improve the war situation that ultimately results in the character of Elim Garak committing murder. In the context of the Dominion War, it is resolved to conceal the truth for the greater good.[55][59] Writer Michael Taylor has suggested, "It showed how Deep Space Nine could really stretch the Star Trek formula. It pushes the boundaries in a realistic way, because the decisions Sisko makes are the kinds of decisions that have to be made in war. They're for the greater good."[60]
