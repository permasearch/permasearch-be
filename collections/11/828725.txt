The difficulties of the military campaigns took a great physical toll on Cornwallis, and he sought to return to England.  John Shore, his replacement, did not arrive until March 1793, and Cornwallis remained until August to assist in the transition.[86] He also oversaw the capture of the French outpost at Pondicherry following the arrival of news that war had again broken out in Europe.[87] On 14 August 1793, without ceremony, he quietly sailed from Calcutta for Madras, and on 10 October he finally sailed for England on board the Swallow.[86]
