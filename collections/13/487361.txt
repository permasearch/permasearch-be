Daisy falls in love with Boss' handsome, rich nephew, Jamie Lee Hogg (Jonathan Frakes), who comes to Hazzard to purchase his uncle's grits mill. The Romeo and Juliet-type romance progresses quickly, and it isn't long before Jamie Lee and Daisy are headed to the altar. But Bo and Luke, overprotective as they are, suspect that something is not right with Jamie Lee, and they confirm their suspicions to be true when they reveal him to be a counterfeiter.
