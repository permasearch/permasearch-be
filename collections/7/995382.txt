Although there is only one capital, London, of the United Kingdom, there are also three other cities which serve as capitals of their respective nations. Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh are the capital cities of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland respectively, while London is also the capital of England. The government, parliament, royal residence and supreme court are actually located in the City of Westminster, Greater London rather than the City of London.
