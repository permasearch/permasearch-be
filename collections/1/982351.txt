Skye deciphers the coded message, learning that it is intended to instigate an uprising within SHIELD, instructing Hydra sleeper agents to come out of hiding. Attempting to contact Fury, May learns of his death. Taking vital information with them on a drive encrypted by Skye (including details on GH325), Coulson, May, Skye, Fitz, Ward and Garrett allow the Bus to be captured by Hand (whom they believe to be the Clairvoyant), escaping into the Hub. Meanwhile, Simmons and Triplett learn of the uprising from Anne Weaver upon trying to contact her for help after finding the GH325 in Skye's blood. Hand captures them and reveals that she is not a Hydra agent, but believes Coulson is due to his recent suspicious behavior.
