"As the repression builds, art comes to be regarded as 'time off for good behaviour' or as 'therapy'" and how the ease and carefreeness of the arts are supposed to bring joy and a sense of calmness."[2] It is used to destroy the monotony of a regular school day, put a dent in the relentlessness of arithmetic and reading. Art should be seen as means of therapy, never something made to cause unrelenting stress and difficulty. If a student becomes less tense and wired up from stress in their learning environments, then they will raise up their grades in other classes, such as math, English, or science. To give off a relaxed vibe, putting art on the wall tends to provide a calming environment that produces a sense of peace and serenity.[3]
