The main hardware platform for Android is the ARM (ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86, MIPS and MIPS64, and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android.[99][100][101] The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for the x86 architectures ahead of the official support.[102][103] MIPS architecture was also supported before Google did. Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[104] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. Since AndroidÂ 5.0 "Lollipop", 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.[99]
