They had played in the 1966 World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, in which England had beaten West Germany 4–2 after extra time. Revenge came just four years later, in the quarter-final of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico when the English side forfeited a comfortable 2–0 lead, losing 2–3 after extra time. West Germany then defeated England in the semi-final of the 1990 competition, this time on penalties. In Euro 1996, Germany again defeated England in a semi-final on penalties. Germany won 1–0 in October 2000 in the last ever match at England's home stadium of Wembley, before it was closed for redevelopment, causing England manager Kevin Keegan to resign from the post.
