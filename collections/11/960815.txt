The duties only extend to persons in business or acting by way of trade, even though not for profit, and only to matters within their control (s.6(7)). Persons who import into the UK are not relieved of liability for activities such as design and manufacture that took place outside the UK and over which they had control.[12] Finance companies who supply articles or substances by way of hire purchase or credit agreement have no duties under section 6 (s.6(9)).
