The Mets made a double switch in the top of the ninth, with Mazzilli taking Strawberry's spot in right field while Rick Aguilera came in to face Jim Rice, Evans and Rich Gedman. After striking out Rice, Aguilera saw shortstop Kevin Elster misplay the ball at shortstop and allow Evans to reach base. He escaped trouble when Gedman grounded to Backman, who turned a double play with Elster and Hernandez to keep the game tied.
