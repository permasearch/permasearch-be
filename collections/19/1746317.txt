At seawater pH, most of the CO2 is immediately converted back into HCOâˆ’ 3. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO2 from the ocean/atmosphere into the lithosphere.[39] The result is that each Ca2+ ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO2 molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO2 from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.[38]
