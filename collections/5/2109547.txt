At the end of episode 5.19 ("Communication Breakdown") Lindsay, still in Montana, texts Danny that their baby is a girl. By episode 5.23 ("Greater Good") she has returned to the lab and goes into labor in the hallway. Adam takes her to the hospital, where, with Danny at her side, she gives birth to a girl. Though they initially disagree on the baby's name (Lindsay wants to name the baby "Lydia," but Danny prefers "Lucy"), they do agree that they want Mac to be the baby's godfather, which he accepts without hesitation. In episode 5.24 ("Grounds For Deception") they have apparently agreed that their daughter's name is Lucy, and have brought her to the lab, where their co-workers coo endlessly over her, including a male co-worker to whom Lucy responds positively, annoying the jealous father.
