On May 12, 2013, NBC announced that Seth Meyers would become the new host of Late Night in 2014, succeeding Jimmy Fallon, who would take over as the new host of The Tonight Show. In September 2013, Lorne Michaels confirmed that Meyers, who would stay on at SNL for at least the first half of the show's 39th season, would be joined at the "Weekend Update" anchor desk by a new co-anchor, Cecily Strong, beginning with the show's season premiere on September 28, 2013. Strong, who joined SNL the previous season, was no stranger to the segment, making visits to the Update desk as her recurring character "The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation With at a Party". Michaels, who also produces Late Night, hinted at Meyers potentially dropping in as Update co-anchor, noting that Meyers's Late Night will not tape on Friday nights.[11] Meyers and Strong sign off with "For 'Weekend Update', I'm Seth Meyers!" "And I'm Cecily Strong, good night!" before performing a fist bump or blowing kisses to the audience.
