The GT comes with a 361 hp (269 kW)[15] 6.0 L (364 cu in) Generation IV V8,[13] featuring a 6-speed 6L80 automatic and Active Fuel Management, capable of reaching 60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.2 seconds,[16] with quarter-mile times as low as 13.4 seconds.[16] The G8 GT averages a fuel economy of 15/24 mpg (city/highway). A 6-speed manual was being considered as an option on the GT model, but Pontiac decided against offering it, stating that it would instead be offered as an option on the G8 GXP. One change in 2009 was the deletion of the center stack oil pressure and voltage gauges. Midway through the 2009 model year a few changes were made to the G8 GT, including an additional pair of catalytic converters which reduced engine output to 355 hp (265 kW), the addition of bluetooth and the removal of the rear cup holders that pulled out from under the rear seats (cupholders in the fold-down rear center armrest took their place).
