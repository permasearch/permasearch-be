In regulations enacted in 2012 under the Dodd-Frank Act the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)[12] extended its regulation under a "Remittance Rule" that added some additional protection for US consumers who send money electronically to foreign countries.[13] The rule targets any remittance institution defined as consumer-to-consumer transfers of low monetary value, made via money transmitters, banks or credit unions, through wire transfers or automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, to businesses as well as to individuals in foreign countries.
