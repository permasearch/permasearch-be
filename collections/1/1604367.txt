Haydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under Napoleon launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighborhood. According to Griesinger, "Four case shots fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble."[40] More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May.[41] Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named SulÃ©my came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from The Creation.[42]
