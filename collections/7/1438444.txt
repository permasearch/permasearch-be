The overall technocratic approach to strengthen political unity across the Mediterranean Sea via a large-scale infrastructure project has some parallels to Desertec, as well some technical aspects as the idea of fostering a cross-border electricity grid in the region. A major difference lies in the stepwise approach taken by Desertec, which took previous failures of large-scale technical visions into account. Atlantropa relied on a single large-scale infrastructure and was never, despite its longstanding popularity, close to technical realization. Desertec was led by a similar macro-engineering vision but attempted to start via small-scale steps, which at least partially succeeded.[17]
