Both male and female D. melanogaster act polygamously (having multiple sexual partners at the same time).[24] In both males and females, polygamy results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies, more so in males than females.[24] Evening activity consists of the activities that the flies participate in other than mating and finding partners, such as finding food.[25] The reproductive success of males and females varies, due to the fact that a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility.[25] Mating with multiple partners provides no advantage over mating with one partner, and therefore females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals.[25] For males, however, mating with multiple partners increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring.[25] This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment.
