Vietnam was drawn into group D together with two Asian powerhouses, Iran and Iraq, as well as Yemen, effectively making Vietnam the only East Asian team to play in the group. Iran, similar to Japan in 2007 AFC Asian Cup, is the leading Asian team in FIFA and AFC rankings, thus repeating Vietnam's fate to share group with Asia's leading team again.
