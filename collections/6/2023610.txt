Youngest member of the Zuka Club's leading council, Hinako Tsuwabuki (石蕗雛子, Tsuwabuki Hinako), also known as "The Lady of the Daisy", is in her first year of high school at Lobelia Girls' Academy. She is the most energetic of the three girls and, as acknowledged by Chizuru, seems to be very intelligent. Her club tends to bother Haruhi, thinking that she should not wear a boy's uniform and insisting that Haruhi should join the Zuka Club.
