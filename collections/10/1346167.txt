Almost exactly 35 years after Hemingway's death, on July 1, 1996, his granddaughter Margaux Hemingway died in Santa Monica, California. Margaux was a supermodel and actress, co-starring with her younger sister Mariel in the 1976 movie Lipstick.[206] Her death was later ruled a suicide, making her "the fifth person in four generations of her family to commit suicide."[207]
