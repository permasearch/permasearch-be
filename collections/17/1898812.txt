The school under the new ownership and management of Atlanta Georgia based, International Educational Management Resources LLC, led by CEO Milo Pinckney and University president Dr. Renu Agnihotri, set up new administration and operations on the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten in September 2013, and obtained a charter from Sint Maarten in January 2014. It soon received its business license from the Sint Maarten government. In September 2014 the university secured authorization from the Sint Maarten Ministry of Education to change its name to "American University of Integrated Sciences, Sint Maarten School of Medicine" and began operating under its new name [4] better reflecting its incorporation of the teaching of alternative medicine practices into its existing US-curriculum-based programs. This initiated the final phase of the new ownership and transfer of the university charter to Sint Maarten. In May of 2016 the University began negotiations with country of Barbados as a possible location for a new campus. The administration was welcomed due to its international recognition in several areas including education, real estate and technology. In November 2016 the University was awarded a charter by the Ministry of Education, and opened its campus in May 2017.
