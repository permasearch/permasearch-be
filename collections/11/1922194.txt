A complete Khmer sentence consists of four basic elementsâ€”an optional topic, an optional subject, an obligatory predicate, and various adverbials and particles.[54] The topic and subject are noun phrases, predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.[54]
