Since the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.[73] These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.[134] For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the People's Action Party of Singapore (PAP) maintains its total domination over Singaporean politics through its "low-key presence, but total control."[135] According to the CPC's own analysis of Singapore, the PAP's dominance can be explained by its "well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups."[135] While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a liberal democracy, they view it as a guided democracy led by the PAP.[135] Other differences are, according to the CPC, "that it is not a political party based on the working classâ€”instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the parliamentary system, not a revolutionary party."[136] Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the United Malays National Organisation, which has ruled Malaysia democratically since 1957, and the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, which dominated Japanese politics for over five uninterrupted decades.[137]
