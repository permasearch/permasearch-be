After an unsuccessful attempt in the proposed Legal Tender Modernization Act of 2001,[49] the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 required that none of the funds set aside for either the Treasury or the Bureau of Engraving and Printing may be used to redesign the $1 bill.[50]  This is because any change would affect vending machines and the risk of counterfeiting is low for this small bill.[51]  This superseded the Federal Reserve Act (Section 16, Paragraph 8) which gives the Treasury permission to redesign any banknote to prevent counterfeiting.[52]
