The United Kingdom has three legal systems, each of which applies to a particular geographical area.[1] English law applies in England and Wales, Northern Ireland law applies in Northern Ireland, and Scots law applies in Scotland. While these three systems diverge in the more detailed rules, there are also substantive fields of law which apply across the United Kingdom.
