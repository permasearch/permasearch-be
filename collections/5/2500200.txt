If all the preventive measures fail and there is a clear and present danger, then there is a need for detection of chemical attacks,[131] collective protection,[132][133][134] and decontamination. Since industrial accidents can cause dangerous chemical releases (e.g., the Bhopal disaster), these activities are things that civilian, as well as military, organizations must be prepared to carry out. In civilian situations in developed countries, these are duties of HAZMAT organizations, which most commonly are part of fire departments.
