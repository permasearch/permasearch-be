Also in 1619, 90 young single women from England went to Jamestown to become wives of the men there, with the women being auctioned off for 150Â pounds of tobacco each (to be paid to the shipping company), as that was the cost of each woman's travel to America.[21] Such voyagers were often called "tobacco brides". There were many such voyages to America for this purpose (the 1619 voyage being the first), with the tobacco brides promised free passage and trousseaus for their trouble.[22]
