Visual hallucinations associated with DLB create a particular burden on caregivers;[48] educating caregivers on how to distract or change the subject when confronted with hallucinations is more effective than arguing over the reality of the hallucination.[15][49] Coping strategies may help and are worth trying, even though there is no evidence for their efficacy.[25] These strategies include having the person with DLB look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.[25] Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.[15]
