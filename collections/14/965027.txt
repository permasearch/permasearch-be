Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp is a 2015 satirical comedy web television series written by David Wain and Michael Showalter, and directed by Wain. The eight-episode Netflix series is a prequel to Wain's 2001 film Wet Hot American Summer, a parody of teen sex comedies which has since developed a cult following.[2] Although many of the original film's ensemble cast have gone on to high-profile work, all of the then-adult actors returned for this series, playing even younger versions of their original roles. The episodes were released for online viewing at the end of July 2015.[3]
