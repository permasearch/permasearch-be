In 2015, TxDot published the plans for the all new SL 335 Freeway Loop that encircles the city of Amarillo.[14] TxDot has planned multiple multi-level interchanges that intersect with Interstate 40. The first, on the East side of Amarillo, is a multi-level interchange that provided access to both directions of the IH-40 Expressway and SL 335. The second interchange with IH-40, however, is a full stack interchange. [15]. A new mainlane bridge that accommodates up to 6 lanes is also in the works for IH-40 near Helium Rd. providing easier access to the new freeway.[16]  Although construction started in 2016, the project is not expected to be complete until 2022.[17]
