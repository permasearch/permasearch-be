Section I of Article Two of the Georgia State Constitution is made up of three paragraphs which detail the method of voting and the right to register and vote.[1] The first paragraph of this section stipulates that all elections by the people will be through secret ballot and will follow legal procedures.[1] Furthermore, in Paragraph II the age and residency of Georgians who are allowed to vote is described as well as the responsibility of the Georgia General Assembly to provide for the "registration of electors".[1] The final paragraph deals with exceptions to the right to register and vote and states that no one who has been convicted of a felony, or anyone who has been determined, by the judiciary, to be "mentally incompetent", may register to vote.[1]
