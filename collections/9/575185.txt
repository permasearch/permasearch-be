Through battles such as Courtrai (1302), Bannockburn (1314), and Morgarten (1315), it became clear to the great territorial princes of Europe that the military advantage of the feudal cavalry was lost, and that a well equipped infantry was preferable.[86] Through the Welsh Wars the English became acquainted with, and adopted, the highly efficient longbow.[87] Once properly managed, this weapon gave them a great advantage over the French in the Hundred Years' War.[88]
