Systematic oppression of pro-Ukrainian intellectuals, conveniently and uniformly dubbed as "nationalists", was carried under the propaganda campaign against Ukrainian nationalism threatening the Soviet way of life.

Switching to Russian, as well as choosing to send children to Russian schools was expedient for educational and career advancement.
