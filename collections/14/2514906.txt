Provided there is more than one link between two switches, the STP root bridge calculates the cost of each path based on bandwidth. STP will select the path with the lowest cost, that is the highest bandwidth, as the preferred link. STP will enable this preferred link as the only path to be used for Ethernet frames between the two switches, and disable all other possible links by designating the switch ports that connect the preferred path as root port.[8] The STP path cost default was originally calculated by the formula 1 Gigabit / second/bandwidth. When faster speeds became available, the default values were adjusted as otherwise speeds above 1Â Gbit/s would have been indistinguishable by STP. Its successor RSTP uses a similar formula with a larger numerator: 20 Terabit / second/bandwidth. These formulas lead to the sample values in the table on the right:[7]:154
