Another possibility[1] is that it was named by Italian ice-cream sellers (many from mountainous areas in the Veneto, Trentino, Bellunes Alps and Friuli) in honour of the final wave of conscripts from the First World War, born in 1899 and referred to as "i Ragazzi del 99" - the Boys of '99. They were held in such high esteem that some streets in Italy were named in honour of them. The chocolate flake may have reminded them of the Alpini Regiments' hat, with a long dark feather cocked at an angle.
