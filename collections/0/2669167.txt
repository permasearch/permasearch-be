Representatives of the American Humane Association were on set at all times to ensure the health and safety of all animals involved,[93] and the Association awarded the film an "outstanding" rating for the care that was taken of all the animals during the production.[94] However, a 2013 suit by former AHA employee Barbara Casey alleges that a horse was killed on set, but the organisation chose to "cover-up the death" to protect Spielberg's reputation.[95] An animatronic horse was used for some parts of the scenes where Joey is trapped in barbed wire;[96] the wire was rubber prop wire.[94]
