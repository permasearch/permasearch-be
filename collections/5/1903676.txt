In its earliest form, Monterey Jack was made by the Mexican Franciscan friars of Monterey, Alta California, during the 18th century.[3] California businessman David Jack sold the cheese commercially. He produced a mild white cheese that came to be known eponymously as "Jack's Cheese", and eventually "Monterey Jack".[4] Other ranchers in the area also produced the cheese. Andrew Molera built up a successful dairy operation on the family ranch in Big Sur. His Monterey Jack cheese was especially well-liked.[5]
