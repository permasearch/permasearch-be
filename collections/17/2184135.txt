McQueen's third wife, Barbara Minty McQueen, in her book Steve McQueen: The Last Mile, writes of McQueen's becoming an Evangelical Christian toward the end of his life.[73] This was due in part to the influences of his flying instructor, Sammy Mason, Mason's son Pete, and Barbara herself.[74] McQueen attended his local church, Ventura Missionary Church, and was visited by evangelist Billy Graham shortly before his death.[74][75]
