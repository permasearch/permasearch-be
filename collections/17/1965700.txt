Marina Beach lies on the stretch of coast where olive ridley sea turtles, a species classified as Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (critically endangered), nest during mating season, chiefly between late October and April peaking from mid-January to mid-February.[24] The Ennoreâ€“Mamallapuram zone,[24] on which the beach lies, is one of the three major nesting grounds on the Indian coast.[25] However, with the expansion of the shrimp trawling fishery in the eastern coast of India in the mid-1970s, several individuals of the species are washed ashore dead every year.[22][25][26] The eggs laid by the females along the beach are also sold in the local market by the fishermen and traders.[24] In 1977, a recovery programme was started by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.[24] Many volunteer organisations in the city, such as the Students' Sea Turtle Conservation Network and the Sea Turtle Protection Force of the TREE Foundation, get involved in conservation of the species along the coast.[22][27]
