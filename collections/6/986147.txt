Many Anti-Masons were opposed to the presidential candidacy of General Andrew Jackson, a Mason, and Fillmore was a delegate to a New York convention that endorsed President John Quincy Adams for re-election, as well as serving at two Anti-Masonic conventions in the summer of 1828.[2] At the conventions, Fillmore and one of the early political bosses, newspaper editor Thurlow Weed, met and impressed each other.[33] By then, Fillmore was the leading citizen in East Aurora, and successfully sought election to the New York State Assembly, serving in Albany for three one-year terms, 1829 to 1831.[2] Fillmore's 1828 election was in contrast to the victories of the Jacksonian Democrats (soon the Democrats), who swept the general to the White House and their party to a majority in Albany, thus Fillmore was in the minority in the Assembly.[34] He proved effective anyway, working to get the legislature to allow court witnesses the option of affirming to tell the truth rather than taking a religious oath, and in 1830 gaining the abolishment of imprisonment for debt.[12] By then, much of Fillmore's legal practice was in Buffalo and later that year he moved there with his family; he did not seek re-election in 1831.[35][33]
