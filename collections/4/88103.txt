The Lord Howe Island stick insect disappeared from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918.[139][140] In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub on the slopes of Ball's Pyramid,[141] has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island.[142] The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months.[143] Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats.[139] Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.
