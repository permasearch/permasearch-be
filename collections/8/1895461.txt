The Eisho-ji dojo was a relatively small affair, consisting of a twelve mat training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being Tomita Tsunejirō and Shiro Saigo.[14] In August, the following year, the pair were granted shodan (初段, first rank) grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.[15]
