Christopher Henry Gayle, OD (born 21 September 1979) is a Jamaican cricketer who plays international cricket for the West Indies.[2] Gayle captained the West Indies' Test side from 2007 to 2010. Considered one of the greatest batsmen in limited-overs cricket, Gayle has set and tumbled numerous records across all three formats of cricket. He is widely acknowledged as the most destructive and greatest Twenty20 batsman in the history of the game. He is well known for hitting sixes very often; in 2012 he became the first player to hit a six off the first ball of a Test match.[3]
