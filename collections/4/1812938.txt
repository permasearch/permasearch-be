where L is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the gnomon makes with the dial plate),      H  H     {\displaystyle H_{H}}   is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true North) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon.  For example, the angle      H  H     {\displaystyle H_{H}}   of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of sin L, since tan 45° = 1.  When L equals 90° (at the North Pole), the horizontal sundial becomes an equatorial sundial; the style points straight up (vertically), and the horizontal plane is aligned with the equatorial plane; the hour-line formula becomes      H  H     {\displaystyle H_{H}}   = 15° × t, as for an equatorial dial.  A horizontal sundial at the Earth's equator, where L equals 0°, would require a (raised) horizontal style and would be an example of a polar sundial (see below).
