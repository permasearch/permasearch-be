Moreover, Cirulla players whose hand of three cards adds up to less than 7 (9 in some regions) have to put all of them down on the table and mark three points as if he scored that many "scopa". To the end of such calculations the seven of cups (hearts in Milanese-types) counts as "matta" ("joker"): the player decides its value. With such a high degree of point-awarding combinations and the possibility of scoring dozens of points in a single hand Cirulla games are tense affairs, where seemingly desperate situations can be reversed in a matter of minutes and where the ultimate goal can be set at hundreds of points, up to 1001 in some cases.
