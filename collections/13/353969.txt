Fr Woods had been very concerned about the lack of education, particularly Catholic education, in South Australia.[1] In 1866, he invited MacKillop and her sisters Annie and Lexie to come to Penola and open a Catholic school.[1] Woods was appointed director of education and became the founder, along with MacKillop, of a school they opened in a stable there. After renovations by their brother, the MacKillops started teaching more than fifty children.[2][3] At this time MacKillop made a declaration of her dedication to God and began wearing black.[4]
