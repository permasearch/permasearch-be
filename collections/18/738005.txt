In a single-phase split-phase motor, reversal is achieved by changing the connection between the primary winding and the start circuit. Some single-phase split-phase motors that are designed for specific applications may have the connection between the primary winding and the start circuit connected internally so that the rotation cannot be changed. Also, single-phase shaded-pole motors have a fixed rotation, and the direction cannot be changed except by disassembly of the motor and reversing the stator to face opposite relative to the original rotor direction.
