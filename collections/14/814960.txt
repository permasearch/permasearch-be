Lopez's debut single, "If You Had My Love", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[36][37] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single "...Baby One More Time" four months prior.[38] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[39] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career."[40] "Waiting for Tonight", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song.[41] Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the "popular actor even more popular". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by "this woman who seemed to have so many different talents".[40] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[42] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[38]
