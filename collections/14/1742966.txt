In South Africa,[1] there are two main branches of legal practitioner: attorneys, who do legal work of all kinds, and advocates,[2] who are specialists litigators. Attorneys may form professional firms and practice in partnerships,[3] ranging in size to the "Big Five" law firms. The profession is regulated by the Attorneys Act, 1979 (Act No. 53 of 1979).[4] See: Advocates in South Africa. There are currently around 21400 attorneys and 5000 candidate attorneys in South Africa, each of which are represented by the LSSA (Law Society of South Africa)[5]
