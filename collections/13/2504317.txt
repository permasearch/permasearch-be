Extant species range in size from the buff-faced pygmy parrot, at under 10 g (0.4 oz) in weight and 8 cm (3.1 in) in length,[21]:149 to the hyacinth macaw, at 1 m (3.3 ft) in length,[27] and the kakapo, at 4.0 kg (8.8 lb) in weight.[28] Among the superfamilies, the three extant Strigopoidea species are all large parrots, and the cockatoos tend to be large birds, as well. The Psittacoidea parrots are far more variable, ranging the full spectrum of sizes shown by the family.[28]
