During the Sengoku period (1467â€“1603), the highest rank of a lady-in-waiting was "female assistant to the major counselor", who ran the affairs of the daily life of the imperial household.[28] The second rank was hoto no naishi ("female palace attendant"), who acted as intermediary between the emperor and those seeking audience and issued his wishes in writing.[28] Ladies-in-waiting acted as imperial secretaries and noted the events at court, visitors and gifts in the official court journals.[28]
