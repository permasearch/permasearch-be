Counting has been considered an ability that shows intelligence. Anecdotal evidence from the 1960s has suggested that crows may count up to 3.[2] Researchers however need to be cautious and ensure that birds are not merely demonstrating the ability to subitize, or count a small number of items quickly.[3][4] Some studies, such as one done at Moscow State University, have suggested that crows may indeed have a true numerical ability.[5] It has been shown that parrots can count up to 6.[6][7]
