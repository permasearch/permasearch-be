The Estonian literature refers to literature written in the Estonian language (ca. 1Â million speakers).[323] The domination of Estonia after the Northern Crusades, from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early written literary works in the Estonian language. The oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century. Originates Livoniae in Chronicle of Henry of Livonia contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The Liber Census Daniae (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.[324] Many folk tales are told to this day and some have been written down and translated to make them accessible to an international readership.[325]
