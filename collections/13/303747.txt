A 1988 scheme was designed to draw foreign investment into Ireland, described in a 1998 Seanad debate as the "Passports for investment scheme"[12] Each had to invest $1,000,000 and live in Ireland for varying periods. The scheme was scrapped in 1998.[13] Before long it was being described as the "sale" of passports in the media, but only 143 passports were passed on under the scheme. Notable applicants included some of the Getty family,[14] Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz and Khalid Sabih Masri. Masri had lent IRÂ£1,100,000 to the petfood company of then-Taoiseach Albert Reynolds.[15]
