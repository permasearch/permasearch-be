In the late eighth century the Visigothic kingdom fell to the Moors, who ruled most of the peninsula for the next seven centuries, leaving only a handful of small Christian realms in the north. Following the Moorish conquest, Europeans began a gradual process of retaking the region known as the Reconquista,[11] which by the late 15th century culminated in the emergence of Spain as a unified country under the Catholic Monarchs. In the early modern period, Spain became one of history's first global empires, leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world's second most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese.
