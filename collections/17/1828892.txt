An off-road vehicle is considered to be any type of vehicle which is capable of driving on and off paved or gravel surface.[1] It is generally characterized by having large tires with deep, open treads, a flexible suspension, or even caterpillar tracks.[citation needed] Other vehicles that do not travel public streets or highways are generally termed off-highway vehicles, including tractors, forklifts, cranes, backhoes, bulldozers, and golf carts.[citation needed]
