Dodner said that during development of the game, she travelled to New Zealand once a month with builds of the game for the filmmakers to play, and on which to give their feedback, and that in total, EA had acquired a quarter of a million different assets from the production.[36] Schofield further pointed out "we even hired the same stunt doubles from the movie to help us render the most realistic movements in the game."[34] Dobner also said "we want the game to not just look like the films but to be exactly like the films."[37] She commented that no details in the game were made up; "when we were reproducing Minas Tirith [...] we felt the team would benefit from being able to see and feel a piece of the actual movie set. Unfortunately, the set had already been dismantled. So, while in New Zealand, I searched the various warehouses to find remnants of the dismantled set. After much work, I returned to San Francisco proudly bearing four bricks from the Minas Tirith set."[37]
