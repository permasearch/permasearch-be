TBS typically begins game coverage with the pregame show MLB on Deck, followed about 38 minutes later by the first pitch of the first game. Each day's coverage ends with Inside MLB (which is formatted similarly to sister network TNT's Inside the NBA). TBS does not show commercial breaks after the third and sixth innings (and also after the ninth inning, if the game goes into extra innings). Instead, it airs a "Game Break" allowing the studio host and analysts more airtime (similar to what is done for British television coverage of an American sporting event). The studio shows originate from Studio J at Turner Sports's headquarters in Atlanta, which is also used for TNT's NBA coverage.
