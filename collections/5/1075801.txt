The Silver Line is a proposed 13.5-mile (21.7Â km) rapid transit corridor to be operated as bus rapid transit (BRT) (or possibly as a light rail line) between the CPCC Levine Campus in Matthews and the proposed Gateway Station in Uptown Charlotte. Proposals call for it to be complete through Idlewild Road by 2022, Sardis Road North by 2024 and finally to CPCC Levine by 2026.[24] As aligned, the completed line will have 16 stations and be completed at an estimated cost of $582 million.[24] By October 2012, the MTC had decided in favor of a busway on interior lanes of the highway.[38] In May 2013, however, a 30-member funding task force suggested a light rail line for the proposed route, at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion.[23] So far, no definite plans to begin construction have been made.
