Internet access varies due to electricity shortages.[19] The Internet has yet to make a significant impact in Burma, where according to official statistics, as of July 2010, there were only 400,000 Internet users (0.8% of the population).[39] More recently, following the reduction in SIM card prices from between $200 and $1,500 before 2012 to $1.50 by 2014[40] these numbers are likely to have dramatically increased because of the widespread popularity of smart-phones. 3G and 4G mobile phone services are available.[citation needed]
