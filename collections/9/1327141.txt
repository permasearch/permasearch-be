Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986.[24][1] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[25] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[26] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[27]
