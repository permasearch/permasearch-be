The first inequality follows from the fact that        (   n k   )    =   n k   ⋅    n − 1   k − 1    ⋯    n − ( k − 1 )  1     {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={\frac {n}{k}}\cdot {\frac {n-1}{k-1}}\cdots {\frac {n-(k-1)}{1}}}   and each of these     k   {\displaystyle k}   terms in this product is     ≥   n k     {\displaystyle \geq {\frac {n}{k}}}  . A similar argument can be made to show        (   n k   )    ≤    n  k    k !      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}\leq {\frac {n^{k}}{k!}}}  . The final strict inequality follows from multiplying       (   n k   )   k     {\displaystyle \left({\frac {n}{k}}\right)^{k}}   by the Taylor series for      e  k     {\displaystyle e^{k}}  .
