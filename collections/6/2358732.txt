In 1931 Housatonic Valley Insurance Agency was established, and became one of the founding members of the New Milford Chamber of Commerce later that year. Today Housatonic Valley Insurance Agency is still located on the New Milford Green in the charming historic white colonial house built in 1795, directly next door to Town Hall.
