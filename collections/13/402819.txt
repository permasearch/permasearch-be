"Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You" is a song written by composers Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin.[1] It was originally recorded in 1984[2] by American singer and guitarist George Benson,[2] and released in 1985 on his studio album 20/20, by Warner Bros. Records.[2] This original version was produced by its own author Michael Masser,[1] and was released as a single only in Europe in 1985.[1] The song was not released as a single in the United States, but nevertheless, Benson recorded two video clips in the U.S. the same year, which were displayed on television programs.[4][5] Two years later, the song became even more well known for a re-recording by Hawaiian singer Glenn Medeiros, whose 1987 cover eventually topped the charts in several countries.
