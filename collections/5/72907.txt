Xbox One S supports video output at 4K resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR) color using HDR10. 4K video can be played from supported streaming services and Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc,[224][227][228] Games are upscaled from 1080p to 4K.[187] Rod Fergusson, head of Microsoft's Gears of War studio The Coalition, stated that Xbox One S also had upgraded CPU and GPU components, which were capable of providing more consistent performance in Gears of War 4 during graphics-intensive sequences than the previous hardware.[229] While Xbox planning lead Albert Penello initially stated that the additional CPU and GPU access granted to developers for Xbox One S is to enable HDR and would have "literally no impact" on the performance of games,[230] games with dynamic resolution or uncapped frame rates can see increased performance due to higher GPU clock speed and ESRAM bandwidth.[231] Xbox One S also ships with a revision of the Xbox One controller, with textured grips and Bluetooth support.[224][232]
