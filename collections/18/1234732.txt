The Furio, VTR and VTS are the sports models which made the C2's predecessor, the Saxo, famous as an affordable, sporty looking and very fast 'pocket rocket'. The Furio has the same sports body kit as the more expensive VTR and VTS models but lacks their alloy wheels. Earlier models of the Furio had 15" Coyote alloys, but these were later replaced with wheel trims from the end of 2003 onwards.
