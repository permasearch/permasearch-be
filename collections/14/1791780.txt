Shutter Island is a period piece with nods to different films in the film noir and horror genres, paying particular homage to Alfred Hitchcock's works.[12] Scorsese stated in an interview that the main reference to Teddy Daniels was Dana Andrews' character in Laura, and that he was also influenced by several very low-budget 1940s zombie movies made by Val Lewton.[13] The main frame of the plot resembles that of William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration,[14][15][16] as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.[16][17][18] La Croix noted that Shutter Island was a "complex and puzzling" work which borrowed from genres as diverse as detective, fantasy, and the psychological thriller.[19]
