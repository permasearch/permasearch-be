Barney and Robin each suffer panic attacks at 5:28 p.m. on Sunday, just 32 minutes before the wedding. Robin considers escaping through the window, as Ted and Victoria had from Victoria's wedding a year earlier. After she brings up how she wishes that Barney had found her locket as a sign of his reliability, Ted secretly gives the locket, which he retrieved from the river, to Barney and instructs him to take credit for finding it. When Robin realizes the truth, she remembers Barney's dishonesty and begins to consider that Ted is the right person for her after all. Ted swallows his feelings, and refuses to run away with her, telling Robin that they aren't the same people who loved each other once and that she and Barney are meant to be together. Unconvinced, Robin decides to run away on her own and crashes into the band's bass player, the event that Future Ted describes as "how Robin met your mother."
