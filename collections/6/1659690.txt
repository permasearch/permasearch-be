During 1942 and 1943 the OWI boasted two photographic units whose photographers documented the country's mobilization during the early years of the war, concentrating on such topics as aircraft factories and women in the workforce. In addition, the OWI produced a series of 267 newsreels in 16Â mm film, The United Newsreel which were shown overseas and to US audiences. These newsreels incorporated U.S. military footage.
