To do so, they summon a mysterious cosmic entity which merges with her.[74] Wanda, under the influence of the entity, launches a campaign of terror against the Avengers, blaming them for the death of her children. The Vision is destroyed, Hawkeye is killed, and Scott Lang is almost killedâ€”but is saved by Wanda's future self, who teleports him to the future. Doctor Strange defeats Wanda, and Magneto leaves with her.[73]
