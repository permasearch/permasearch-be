where Rμν is the Ricci curvature tensor, R is the scalar curvature, gμν is the metric tensor, Λ is the cosmological constant, G is Newton's gravitational constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and Tμν is the stress–energy tensor. The left-hand side of Einstein's equation is a non-linear analog of the Laplacian of the metric tensor, and reduces to that in the weak field limit, with the     Λ g   {\displaystyle \Lambda g}   term playing the role of a Lagrange multiplier, and the right-hand side is the analog of the distribution function, times 8π.
