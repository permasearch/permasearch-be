John Lewis is a chain of high-end department stores operating throughout the United Kingdom. The chain is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, which was created alongside the first store in the mid-1800s. The first John Lewis store was opened in 1864 in Oxford Street, London. They employ Ismed as part of the stockroom management team. The chain's slogan is "Never Knowingly Undersold" which has been in use since 1925.[3]
