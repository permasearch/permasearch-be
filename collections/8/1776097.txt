Zampese’s father, Ernie Zampese, spent 36 years as a coach in the NFL, spending time with the New York Jets, San Diego Chargers, Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, Washington Redskins, and both the Los Angeles Rams and St. Louis Rams. Ernie Zampese is known best for his role on the Chargers’ offensive coaching staff in the 1970s and '80s, when he helped engineer the famed "Air Coryell" offense. The "Air Coryell" offense—still considered one of the best passing offenses in NFL history—featured Hall of Famers Dan Fouts, Charlie Joiner and Kellen Winslow, along with John Jefferson and Wes Chandler. These dynamic players operated in a scheme that led the league in passing yards an NFL-record six consecutive seasons (1978-1983).
