In her first lead solo performance since the first season, Mays performed "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from The Rocky Horror Show during the themed episode "The Rocky Horror Glee Show"; it was the song she'd used when auditioning for the role of Emma.[23] Anthony Benigno of the Daily News named it the best song of the episode, and graded it "A+".[45] Despite finding the episode "abrupt, uneven [and] sanitized", Flandez felt that it was saved by this performance.[46] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone remarked that having Emma in the role of Janet was "ideal", but preferred the song visually to vocally.[47] Slant Magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz disliked the change in Emma's characterization which brought about the number, and while he wrote that "Mays was so charming that she almost, almost saved it", he ultimately found the "motivational contortions" insulting to the audience.[48] The track was included on the EP Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show.[49] It charted at number 72 in the UK,[50] and 96 in Canada.[51]
