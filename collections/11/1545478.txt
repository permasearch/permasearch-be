Between the second and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further conflict in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC.[146] They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War,[147] against the Istrians in the Istrian War,[148] against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War,[149] and against Achaia in the Achaean War.[150]
