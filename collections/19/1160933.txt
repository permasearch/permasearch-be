In 1981, Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson developed the first widely used instrument for assessing burnout, namely, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).[12] Consistent with Maslach's conceptualization, the MBI operationalizes burnout as a three-dimensional syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.[12][3] Other researchers have argued that burnout should be limited to fatigue and exhaustion.[13]
