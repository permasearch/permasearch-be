In 1995, Stern signed an advance deal with ReganBooks worth around $3 million to write his second book, Miss America.[125] Stern wrote about various topics, including his cybersex experiences on the Internet service Prodigy, a private meeting with Michael Jackson, his suffering with back pain and obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, and his run for Governor of New York.[126] Following its release on November 7, 1995, Miss America sold 33,000 copies at Barnes & Noble stores which set a new one-day record for the chain,[127] and 120,000 in its first week. It entered The New York Times Best-Seller list at number one and stayed on the list for 16 weeks.[100] According to Publishers Weekly, 1.39 million copies were sold in 1995 alone which ranked it the year's third best-selling book.[128] As with Private Parts, Stern's book signings attracted thousands. His November 30, 1995, appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno caused controversy after he appeared on the show with two bikini-clad women who kissed each other and received spanks from Stern. Leno, who urged that both acts would be edited out from the final broadcast, walked off the stage after the segment without thanking Stern.[129]
