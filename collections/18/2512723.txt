Another of McCoy's catchphrases is his "I'm a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)..." statements,[46] delivered by Kelley 11 times,[5]:166 and three times (by Karl Urban) in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as the "classic moment" when he is confronted with the unusual silicon-based Horta alien in "The Devil in the Dark" (1967), saying, "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."[47] The phrase also appears in the 2009 film, in which McCoy (Karl Urban) says "I'm a doctor, not an astrophysicist!" to Spock. Similarly, in 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness, McCoy (Urban again) tells Spock, "Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!" In 2016's Star Trek Beyond, McCoy starts to say the line, but is beamed out of the scene before he can finish it.
