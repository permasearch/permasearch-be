Beta decays can be classified according to the angular momentum (L-value) and total spin (S-value) of the emitted radiation. Since total angular momentum must be conserved, including orbital and spin angular momentum, beta decay occurs by a variety of quantum state transitions to various nuclear angular momentum or spin states, known as "Fermi" or "Gamow-Teller" transitions. When beta decay particles carry no angular momentum (L=0), the decay is referred to as "allowed", otherwise it is "forbidden".
