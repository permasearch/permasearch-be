Reaction to Matt Hullum's statement made on August 15, 2014, about RWBY being anime has been mixed. Lindsay Jones said "Funnily enough, we showed our Japanese cohorts RWBY and they started arguing about whether it was anime or not! But seeing the reception from audiences is so surreal, and we never expected it."[52] A Movie Pilot blog listed the RWBY as anime topic among its "flame wars you don't want to be part of".[53] Anime News Network writers Paul Jensen and James Beckett wrote: "We don't have any formal reviews of RWBY here on ANN, but it is kind of cool to see an American production make it to the release encyclopedia."[54] Michael Mauer of The Cornell Daily Sun wrote that the issue was still being debated among the anime community,[55] while Sabrina Pyun of ComicsVerse wrote "The show is known for many things, from its dubious status as an anime to its unique 3D animation style."[56] However, mainstream news articles dated after Hullum's statement and previewing later seasons and the franchise have referred to RWBY as an American anime, including Variety,[57] Collider,[58] iDigitalTimes,[59] Entertainment Weekly,[2] Adweek,[60] and Deadline Hollywood.[61]
