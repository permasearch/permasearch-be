There has been debate as to the true left field distance, which was once posted as 315 feet. A reporter from The Boston Globe was able to sneak into Fenway Park and measure the distance. When the paper's evidence was presented to the club in 1995, the distance was remeasured by the Red Sox and restated at 310 feet.[67] The companion 96 meters sign remained unchanged until 1998, when it was corrected to 94.5 meters.[68]
