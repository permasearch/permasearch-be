Shadow of War will be released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows both via Steam and through Microsoft's "Play Anywhere" program for Windows 10 with the Xbox One version. The Play Anywhere feature will extend to Microsoft's upcoming premium console, the Xbox One X, upon that console's launch, which is planned for the end of 2017.[18]
