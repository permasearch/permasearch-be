By November 1978, the Dolphins' winning streak in the series had reached 17 games, a mark tied for the longest streak in NFL history for one team against another. The press in the Buffalo area frequently noted this fact.[7] The Dolphins broke the record with a 25–24 result in Buffalo's Rich Stadium on November 12 of that year.[8] With 9–7 and 17–7 victories in 1979, Miami's streak reached 20 by the end of the decade.[1]
