By the time that commercial music began to be recorded, the verse melody of "My Old Kentucky Home" had become so widely known that recording artists sometimes quoted it in material that was otherwise unrelated to Foster's song.  Henry Burr's 1921 recording of "Kentucky Home" quotes the melody in an interlude midway through the record.[39]  And vaudeville singer Billy Murray's 1923 recording of  "Happy and Go-Lucky in My Old Kentucky Home" adds the melody in the record's finale.[40]  An earlier recording by Murray, 1915's "We'll Have a Jubilee in My Old Kentucky Home", takes the further step of incorporating a portion of Foster's melody (but not his lyrics) into each chorus.[41]  And a  few decades earlier than that, a young Charles Ives, while still a student at Yale University in the 1890s, used Foster's melody (both the verse and the chorus) as a strain in one of his marches.  Ives often quoted from Foster and musicologist Clayton Henderson has detected material from "My Old Kentucky Home" in eight of his works.[42]
