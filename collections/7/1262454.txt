Channel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives.[5]  Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.[11]
