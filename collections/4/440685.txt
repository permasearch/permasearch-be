The drafting of a story for a Conan film started in 1976; Summer conceived a script with the help of Roy Thomas,[30] a comic-book writer and Conan expert who had been writing the character's adventures for years for Marvel Comics.[27]  Summer and Thomas's tale, in which Conan would be employed by a "dodgy priest to kill an evil wizard", was largely based on Howard's "Rogues in the House". Their script was abandoned when Oliver Stone joined the project.[71] Stone was, at this time, going through a period of addiction to cocaine and depressants. His screenplay was written under the influence of the drugs[72] and the result was what Milius called a "total drug fever dream", albeit an inspired one.[73] According to Schwarzenegger, Stone completed a draft by early 1978.[74]  Taking inspiration from Howard's "Black Colossus" and "A Witch Shall be Born", Stone proposed a story, four hours long,[75] in which the hero champions the defense of a princess's kingdom.  Instead of taking place in the distant past, Stone's story was set in a postapocalyptic future where Conan leads an army in a massive battle against a horde of 10,000Â mutants.[38]
