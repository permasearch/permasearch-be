It is clear that animals of quite a range of species are capable of solving problems that appear to require abstract reasoning;[80] Wolfgang KÃ¶hler's (1917) work with chimpanzees is a famous early example. He observed that chimpanzees did not use trial and error to solve problems such as retrieving bananas hung out of reach. Instead, they behaved in a manner that was "unwaveringly purposeful," spontaneously placing boxes so that they could climb to reach the fruit.[81] Modern research has identified similar behavior in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent, if appropriate pre-training is given.[82] Causal reasoning has also been observed in rooks and New Caledonian crows.[83][84]
