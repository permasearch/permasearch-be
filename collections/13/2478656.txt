"Home" marks the return of writers Morgan and Wong, who left the show following its second season. The duo attempted to make their first episode upon return as ambitious and shocking as possible. They were inspired by real-life events, including a story from Charlie Chaplin's autobiography about an encounter in an English tenement home. The graphic content of the script attracted controversy from early in the production process. Commentators have identified themes within the episode that satirize the American dream, address the concept of globalization, and explore the nature of motherhood. It has been cited as a seminal episode of The X-Files by critics and crew members.
