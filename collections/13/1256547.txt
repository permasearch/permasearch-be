Emily was a female character who was Charlie Brown's partner in a school dance. She first appeared on February 11, 1995. It was revealed that Emily was merely a figment of Charlie Brown's imagination as the teacher said that there was no one in the class named Emily. However, in her later appearances, Emily was never mentioned to be an imaginary character and Snoopy was also able to see her as well. The question of whether Emily was an imaginary character or not was never resolved.
