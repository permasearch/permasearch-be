In October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money.[15] Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled.[15] The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).[15]
