For the signature challenge the bakers are asked to bake a Double-crusted Fruit Pie with a filling of their choice. For their fourth Technical challenge, the bakers were required to bake a Tart that has almost a 700-year history; the Egg Custard Tart. For the showstopper, the challenge was to make a Filo Pie centrepiece using the Filo pastry that they had made from scratch.
