Golf is a Scottish import to many countries but it is said to have been played in this region by St Cuthbert on the dunes of the Northumberland coast. The oldest club in Northeast England was Alnmouth founded in 1869 â€“ the fourth oldest in the country and is now Alnmouth Village Club and an interesting 9 hole links course.[112] There are three fine old links courses in this region at Seaton Carew, Goswick and Redcar.
