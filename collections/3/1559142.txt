In July 2013, while they were staying at a hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, someone overheard a dispute coming from their room and called the police. After a "heated argument", they had begun hitting each other.[17] When the police arrived, they arrested Roberts. Peters was not arrested because Roberts did not have any immediately visible injuries.[18] Peters declined to press charges and Roberts was released several hours later.[19] In a joint statement, the couple called it "an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding", and stated that they were "working together to move past it."[19]
