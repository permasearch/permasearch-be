For example, a 3-ary (ternary) Gray code would use the values {0, 1, 2}. The (n, k)-Gray code is the n-ary Gray code with k digits.[27] The sequence of elements in the (3, 2)-Gray code is: {00, 01, 02, 12, 11, 10, 20, 21, 22}. The (n, k)-Gray code may be constructed recursively, as the BRGC, or may be constructed iteratively. An algorithm to iteratively generate the (N, k)-Gray code is presented (in C):
