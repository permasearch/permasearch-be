Marissa Benson (Mary Scheer) is Freddie's stereotypically overprotective, and sensitive safe-cautious mom, first appearing in "iWanna Stay with Spencer". She is very neurotic and constantly treats her son like a child. She is worried about him getting hurt or having relationships with girls (especially Carly), but in "iWill Date Freddie", she wanted Carly to love him. Marissa constantly embarrasses Freddie in public, often by making him follow all of her strange rules. She does not seem to care about other people's apologies as seen in the special "iSaved Your Life". She has a somewhat negative relationship with Carly and Spencer, except for "iParty with Victorious," when she and Carly actually have a nice conversation. She also has a fear of germs shown in "iToe Fat Cakes" and "iCan't Take It".
