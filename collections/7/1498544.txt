Thirteen reservoirs have been identified at Calakmul.[10] The combined capacity of all the reservoirs is estimated at over 200,000,000 litres (44,000,000 imp gal).[10] This quantity of water could have supported 50,000 to 100,000 people; there is no evidence that the reservoirs were used to irrigate crops.[73]
