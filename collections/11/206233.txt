Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 replaces Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite.[119] It includes new modeling tools,[120] such as the Architecture Explorer, which graphically displays projects and classes and the relationships between them.[66][121] It supports UML activity diagram, component diagram, (logical) class diagram, sequence diagram, and use case diagram.[121] Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases are impacted by modifications to the source code, without actually running the test cases.[122] This speeds up testing by avoiding running unnecessary test cases.
