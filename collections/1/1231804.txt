At the Last Chance Workout, the Red and Blue Teams strategize and prepare for one of their team members to be sidelined at the weigh-in. The Blue Team assumes that Damien will be chosen and it will be up to the three ladies to pull their weight for the team. They're up for the challenge and are excited to have Damien's back the way he had theirs the week before. Meanwhile, Jen takes the White Team to the beach for their last workout and a strategy session.
