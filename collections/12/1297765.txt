The 900 can also be attempted on a BMX bike, skis, snowboard, inline skates or a scooter. BMX-Rider Mat Hoffman was the first person to successfully land the 900 on film at a competition in Canada in 1989.[31] At the 2002 X Games, Hoffman took the trick a step further by landing a no-handed 900.[32] Simon Tabron's signature trick is the 900.[33] In the 2007 X Games 13 Simon Tabron landed the first back-to-back 900s.[34]
