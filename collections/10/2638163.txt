New Gold Wing engine design goals were smoothness, quietness and enormous power.[15][55] Ultimately, a redesigned Gold Wing made its debut at the 1987 Cologne Motorcycle Show, 13 years after the original GL1000 was first shown to the public at the same venue, and the GL1500 brought the most changes seen to the Gold Wing series since its inception. The biggest difference was that the flat-four engine was replaced with a flat-six engine.[84] Although the GL1500 still used carburetors, there were just two large 36Â mm CV Keihins supplying all six cylinders, the first time any Gold Wing had less than one carb per cylinder.[48]
