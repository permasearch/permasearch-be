67. "The Big Mothers for Others Episode": Phyllis recruits Mona, Spencer and Adam to help out with a telethon on Mother's Day. Big Dee Dee and Dee Dee also decide to participate. Phyllis grows so frustrated with Big Dee Dee's interference at a pre-telethon meeting that she blurts out that Big Dee Dee was pregnant before she got married. Dee Dee is shocked and hurt by the fact that this was kept a secret from her, while Mona gives Phyllis the silent treatment because she is fed up with her bluntness and inability to keep her mouth shut.
