The Stag Man (voiced by Robert Englund) is a part-stag, part-human creature and the main villain of "Camping Can Be Cool". He is angry with Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen, and Margaret for trespassing in his forest and intends to hunt them down, but plays fair and lets them get a head start. He proceeds to chase them down until he is hit by a truck and is last seen taken into custody by the forest rangers.
