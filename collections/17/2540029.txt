After Elvis Presley began his musical career, he purchased a $40,000 home for himself and his family at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis, TN.[10] As his fame grew, especially after his appearances on television, the number of fans that would congregate outside the house multiplied.[10] Presley's neighbors, most of whom were happy to have a celebrity living nearby, soon came to find the constant gathering of fans and journalists a nuisance.[10] After several complaints, Presley decided it was necessary for him to move to a property more suitable.[citation needed]
