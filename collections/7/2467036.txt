History Sasha came to town when her former co-worker, Phyllis Romalotti, contacted her in order for her to switch her son's, Daniel, paternity tests as her then-husband, Danny Romalotti, wanted one, feeling that Phyllis was not being honest about it. Christine Blair was also investigating Daniel's paternity for Danny. Sasha did what Phyllis wanted, and Phyllis outsmarted Christine. Phyllis then paid a former love of hers, Peter Garrett, to romance Sasha. The two began dating and moved to New York City together.
