Two weeks after the expansion's official release, the PlayStation 4 version was re-released to fix performance issues.[33] In a performance analysis by Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, it was discovered that although Fallout 4 typically ran at 30 frames per second (fps), when the player was outside and, in Far Harbor's foggy biomes, the frame rate could drop to 15 fps, and could drop even lower during action-oriented events such as firefights. In the same analysis, the Xbox One version was found to run at 20â€“30 fps but experienced various issues, such as stuttering and software lock-ups.[34] The update toned down the level of fog, and was successful in making the game more stable.[35]
