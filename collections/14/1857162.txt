An administrative installation creates an uncompressed source image for a product, typically to be used for installing or running an application from a network location.[10] An administrative installation is not a typical installation, in that it does not create any shortcuts, register COM servers, create an Add or Remove Programs entry, and so on. Often an administrative installation enables a user to install the product in such a way that its features run from the uncompressed installation source.
