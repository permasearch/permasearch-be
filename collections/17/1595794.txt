Performance, maintenance, service life, and recovery costs from recycling are factors that determine the cost effectiveness of building components. While copperâ€™s initial cost is higher than some other architectural metals, it usually does not need to be replaced during the life of a building. Due to its durability, low maintenance, and ultimate salvage value, the additional cost for copper may be insignificant over the life of a roofing system.[44]
