Business analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs.   Essentially, they want to define the right application.  This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to ‘customer’ feedback,  and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program.  If a business analyst has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written – resulting in rework as discussed below.  The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the development cycle.  Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused.  Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or "Keep it Simple" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going maintenance of the implemented solution.
