Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first "transistor") and the amplifying function (the second "transistor"); it is the same naming convention used in resistor–transistor logic (RTL) and diode–transistor logic (DTL).
