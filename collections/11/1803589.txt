"Good Day Sunshine" was written by McCartney, whose piano playing dominates the recording.[202] The track was one of several contemporary songs that evoked the unusually hot and sunny English summer of 1966.[203] Music critic Richie Unterberger describes it as a song that conveys "one of the first fine days of spring, just after you've fallen in love or started a vacation".[204] The verses reflect aspects of vaudeville, while McCartney also acknowledged the influence of the Lovin' Spoonful on the composition.[204] Overdubbed by Martin,[205] the piano solo on the track recalls the ragtime style of Scott Joplin.[206] The song ends with group harmonies repeating the title phrase,[207] creating an effect that Riley likens to a "cascade" of voices "enter[ing] from different directions, like sun peeping through the trees".[206]
