The Art Institutes (Ai) are a system of art colleges owned by Dream Center Education Holdings. At its height, The Art Institutes had greater than 50 campuses. However, as the for-profit education sector came under scrutiny, many campuses saw a marked decrease in enrollment. As such, at least 30 schools closed in 2017.
