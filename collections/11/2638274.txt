Another source of cotton fibre comes from the cotton ginning process.  The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as linters for their short length and resemblance to lint.  Linters are too short for successful use in fabric.  Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts.  The first cuts are longer.
