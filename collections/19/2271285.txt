In particle physics, a kaon /ˈkeɪ.ɒn/, also called a K meson and denoted K,[nb 1] is any of a group of four mesons distinguished by a quantum number called strangeness. In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark (or antiquark) and an up or down antiquark (or quark).
