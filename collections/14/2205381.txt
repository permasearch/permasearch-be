Data from the Ministry of Justice from 2005â€“2014 shows that 378 people have been convicted of Hunting Act offences over that period, but only 24 of the offenders were involved with registered hunts. More than 94% of Hunting Act convictions did not involve hunts but were related to poaching or other casual hunting activities.[39] Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said in a written answer to Parliament in June 2011 that "it is not possible to separately identify those specific cases proceeded against under the Hunting Act 2004 related to hunts recognised and regulated by the Council of Hunting Associations" since "statistical information available centrally does not include the circumstances of each case."[40] In 2014, the number of successful convictions under the act had risen to 430.[41]
