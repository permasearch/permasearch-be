Following Pope John Paul II's trip to Mexico in 1978, the Knights produced an English-language video documenting the visit.[37] The following year the pontiff returned to Poland. Bishop Paul Marcinkus, President of the Institute for the Works of Religion, later told the order that raw footage of the trip existed, but there were no funds available to edit it into a usable format.[37] The Knights provided the money, and the videos were shown on Polish television and in movie theaters.[37] During his visit to the United States in October of the same year, the order once again provided funding to video record it at the request of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.[37]
