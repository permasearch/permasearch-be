Centipeetle (vocal effects by Dee Bradley Baker) is an acid-spitting, centipede-like corrupted Gem monster that first appeared in the series premiere "Gem Glow", in which the Crystal Gems fight and defeat her and encase her in a bubble. In the midâ€“first-season episode "Monster Buddies", Steven frees her from her bubble and befriends her; in the third season, he is able to partially and temporarily heal her gem's corruption, and he learns of her history as a member of the Homeworld army who was left behind when the Homeworld Gems fled Earth and became corrupted by the Diamonds' attack. At the end of the fifth season, Steven convinces Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond to attempt to fully cure her corruption; she is briefly restored to her original self as Nephrite (voiced by Aparna Nancherla), but soon reverts back to Centipeetle again.
