Tofu-making was first recorded during the Chinese Han dynasty some 2,000 years ago.[8] Chinese legend ascribes its invention to Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). Tofu and its production technique were introduced to Japan[9][10][11] during the Nara period (710–794). Some scholars believe tofu arrived in Vietnam during the 10th and 11th centuries.[12] It spread to other parts of Southeast Asia as well.[13] This probably coincided with the spread of Buddhism as tofu it is an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet of East Asian Buddhism.[9] Li Shizhen, during the Ming Dynasty, described a method of making tofu in the Compendium of Materia Medica.[14] Since then, tofu has become a staple in many countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Korea, with regional variations in production methods, texture, flavor, and usage.
