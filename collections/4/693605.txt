The theorem may also be proven using trigonometry: Let     O = ( 0 , 0 )   {\displaystyle O=(0,0)}  ,     A = ( − 1 , 0 )   {\displaystyle A=(-1,0)}  , and     C = ( 1 , 0 )   {\displaystyle C=(1,0)}  . Then B is a point on the unit circle     ( cos ⁡ θ , sin ⁡ θ )   {\displaystyle (\cos \theta ,\sin \theta )}  . We will show that ∆ABC forms a right angle by proving that AB and BC are perpendicular — that is, the product of their slopes is equal to –1. We calculate the slopes for AB and BC:
