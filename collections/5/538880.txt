The retired Police Commissioner and father of Frank (grandfather of Danny, Erin, Jamie, and the late Joe; great-grandfather of Nicky, Sean, and Jack). His childhood during the 1920s and 1930s was hard due to his father, Charles, an Irish immigrant, World War I veteran and former police officer, being an alcoholic and unable to hold a job. Henry was a Marine in World War II and Korea, and joined the NYPD in 1952. He got married in 1955. Like his grandson Danny, Henry is socially conservative and hates the political correctness of modern law and order. His wife of 46 years, Betty, died December 2, 2001. It is later revealed that Henry and Betty had another son, Peter Christopher, who died of leukemia at the age of 18 months, over a year before Frank was born.
