On Tuesday, 24 July 1705, The Post Man announced West of Kent v Chatham, an 11-a-side game to be played in Kent on Tuesday, 7 August. The primary source gives the venue as "Maulden" which must have been a typeset error as there is no such place. It was possibly Maidstone or Malling. The title "West of Kent" suggests a team representative of several parishes, so this is arguably the earliest known important match in Kent. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called "West Kent" and "East Kent". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.[71][94]
