As of the end of the 2016–17 season, the Austrian team has won 30 consecutive Nations Cups, while topping the men's standings for 25 straight years. Austria is the only nation to have finished in the top 3 of the Nations Cup standings in all 50 years in which World Cup competition has been held, winning in 38 of those years, runner-up in 11 years, and third place in a single year.  Austrian men have failed to make the podium in only one season: 1972.  Austrian women have failed to make the podium in only 2 seasons: 1981 and 1982. Switzerland with 7 wins and France with 5 wins are the only other nations to have won the nations cup. In the midst of the ongoing Austrian juggernaut, the Swiss or Italian teams have usually held second place.  The German team reached the runner-up spot for the first time in 1997–8, as did the Norwegians the next season.  The US enjoyed its best placings ever starting in 2004–5, grabbing second in the Nations Cup for two straight years.
