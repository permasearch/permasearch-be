In the episode "The Hole in the Heart", he is killed by renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky, who shoots him in the heart. His last words, spoken to Booth and Brennan, are "Don't make me leave". Brennan initially interprets Vincent's last words as a plea to not be fired from his job at the Jeffersonian, although Booth later tells her that Vincent was declaring that he did not want to die. Vincent's death acts as a catalyst for Brennan and Booth to sleep together. Vincent is later honored by Angela and Hodgins, who name their son Michael Staccato Vincent Hodgins.[1] It is also revealed in this episode that he was Brennan's favorite intern.
