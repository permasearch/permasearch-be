Orso Ipato's successor, Teodato Ipato, moved his seat from Eraclea to Malamocco in the 740s.[1] He was the son of Orso and represented the attempt of his father to establish a dynasty. Such attempts were more than commonplace among the doges of the first few centuries of Venetian history, but all were ultimately unsuccessful. During the reign of Teodato Ipato, Venice became the only remaining Byzantine possession in Italy.
