The name "Finland" originally signified only the southwestern province that has been known as "Finland Proper" since the 18th century. First known mention of Finland is in runestone Gs 13 from 11th century. The original Swedish name for the realm's eastern part was Österlands in plural, meaning the area of Finland proper, Tavastia and Karelia, but it was later transferred into singular form Österland (lit. Eastern Land) which was in use between 1350-1470.[25] In the 15th century Finland began to be used synonymously with Österland. The concept of a Finnish "country" in the modern sense developed slowly from the 15th to 18th centuries.
