Once an informal information broker in Vice City ("informal" in that Tommy Vercetti roughed him up whenever he wanted information), Paul returned to England where he became a record producer extraordinaire, bringing a new English band, The Gurning Chimps (led by Maccer), to San Andreas for publicity. However, he was left stranded in the desert with Maccer after partying with The Truth. Paul and Maccer are eventually rescued by CJ who takes them to see Ken Rosenberg (an acquaintance of Paul's). The trio are later held by Salvatore Leone, the don of the Leone family until CJ formulates a plan to deceive Leone into thinking that Paul, Maccer and Rosenberg are dead. Paul later reappears in Los Santos where he begins producing music for Madd Dogg whilst the rapper is beginning to rebuild his career.
