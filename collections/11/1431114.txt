"Whistle" was written by Flo Rida, David Glass, Marcus Killian, DJ Frank E, Breyan Isaac, and Antonio Mobley while production was handled by DJ Frank E and Glass.[2] The song premiered online in April 2012.[3] During an interview with Billboard magazine, Flo Rida described the song as "the biggest record I've done yet".[4] Later, during an interview with MTV News, Flo Rida revealed that the lyrics of the song are sung in a metaphorical way, saying that it had sexually suggestive lyrics. He noted, "Well, put your own swing on it, but for the most part I keep it clean, but if you listen to it, you can take it another way as well". When asked how does he know where to draw the line between sexually suggestive and downright dirty lyrics, he acknowledged that when he's in the studio, "I have my boys in there and they'll tell me and give me their suggestions and what they think..... If it's too much I'll go back."[5]
