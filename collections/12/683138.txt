Shadow Hammer (Aaron Aguilera) is a criminal who appears in "iSam's Mom". He had never been caught on video because he sneaks in before robbing a place and disables the cameras. This changes when Freddie uses his spy glasses and catches him, but when T-Bo and a newscaster talk about what he did, Freddie worries that Shadow Hammer will find him and beat him down. Spencer fixes the problem by changing the sign at his apartment to 8H instead of 8D. At the end of the episode, Shadow Hammer looks for apartment 8D, and leaves when he sees the sign at Freddie's apartment reading 8H.
