According to Susan Page and Naomi Jagoda of USA Today in 2010, the Tea Party was more "a frustrated state of mind" than "a classic political movement".[188] Tea party members "are more likely to be married and a bit older than the nation as a whole".[188] They are predominantly white, but other groups make up just under one-fourth of their ranks.[188] They believe that the federal government has become too large and powerful.[188]
