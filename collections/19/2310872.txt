Stephen Moore released two pop singles—Marvin/Metal Man[5] and Reasons to Be Miserable/Marvin I Love You (double B-side)—in the UK in 1981, though neither reached the top 40. Two of these were re-recorded and rearranged to coincide with the 2005 Hitchhiker's movie release, "Reasons To Be Miserable (His Name Is Marvin)" and "Marvin" now being performed by Stephen Fry (singing in the third-person, not as Marvin).
