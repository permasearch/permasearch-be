In a Facebook announcement titled "Does the truth hurt?" on 19 January 2015, current keyboardist Chris Marion offered his side of the story and exclaimed; "Heck, I’ve now been in the band longer than Beeb Birtles."[76] Little River Band founding member and hit songwriter Graeham Goble responded "LRB's current keys player Chris Marion’s Facebook rant is full of inaccuracies, too many for me to address. I just want to make one retort, concerning his comment that he’s now been in LRB longer than Beeb Birtles. As if length of tenure is any claim to talent or anything. Beeb has a timbre to his voice & a vocal harmony talent that maybe 5 guys in music history can equal. I say the same about Glenn Shorrock’s voice. There are millions of Chris Marions in this World and five of them are in the current touring LRB.[77]
