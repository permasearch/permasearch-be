In 2011 an officer accused the police chief, Michael Jez, of giving officers ticket quotas, which are illegal in the state of Texas. In November city council voted to place Chief Jez on administrative leave. The council did not give a reason and Jez cited philosophical differences for the separation. Much speculation was made that the decision was a reaction to the allegation made, but neither side ever admitted to any wrongdoing.[19][20]
