The genre reached national exposure when it was represented by vocal groups such as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean.[11] Dale is quoted on such groups: "They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn't surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ... That was the difference ... the real surfing music is instrumental."[12]
