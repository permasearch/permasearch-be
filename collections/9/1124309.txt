In 1999, Shevchenko joined Italian club Milan for a then-record transfer fee of $25 million. He made his league debut on 28 August 1999 in a 2–2 draw with Lecce.[12] Alongside five other players — Michel Platini, John Charles, Gunnar Nordahl, Istvan Nyers, and Ferenc Hirzer — he managed, as a foreign player, to win the Serie A scoring title in his debut season, finishing with 24 goals in 32 matches. Shevchenko maintained his excellent form into the 2000–01 season, scoring 24 goals in 34 matches. Shevchenko also managed to score nine goals in 14 matches in the Champions League. Milan, however, failed to get past the second group stage.
