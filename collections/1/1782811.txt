Russian canoeists have qualified a total of ten boats in each of the following distances for the Games through the 2015 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships.[37] Meanwhile, one additional boat was awarded to the Russian squad in men's K-1 1000 m by virtue of a top two national finish at the 2016 European Qualification Regatta in Duisburg, Germany.[38] As a response to the "multiple positive cases" of doping by Belarus and Romania, two further spare boats were accepted by the Russian team to round out the roster size to ten.
