Maya describes Riley's place of uniqueness as "Rileytown", but mere mention of that word causes Riley to become irate and call Maya a "bully". At the same time, the two girls and the rest of Cory's class learn how to resolve conflicts. With the Aaron Burr-Alexander Hamilton conflict as the class example, Riley decides to challenge Maya to a duel, and they carry it out at Topanga's, using ice cream as their weaponry. After Maya backs out, Riley ice-creams her. Maya becomes aware that something is wrong with Riley, and Farkle, recalling when he was bullied, thinks someone is bullying Riley. Maya talks to Riley and wants her to open up about what is going on. Riley explains that she is being bullied by someone sending her threatening text messages, and that the term "Rileytown" caused her to feel different and humiliated, causing her to take it out on Maya. Farkle, Lucas, and Zay come to talk to her as well, saying she can come to them if something is bothering her, which is further discussed in her father's class. The bully has been taking videos of Riley at school which include Riley giving herself "award ceremonies" every Friday, and threatens to send the rest of the school those videos. To confront her unseen bully, Riley shows she is not ashamed of her quirky personality by performing one of her award ceremonies in front of the whole school. The unseen bully realizes that she can no longer damage Riley's confidence and runs away.
