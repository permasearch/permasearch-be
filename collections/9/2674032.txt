Polymorphism as used in zoology and biology involves morphs of the phenotype, and the term polyphenism can be used to clarify that the different forms arise from the same genotype. The term genetic polymorphism is also used somewhat differently by geneticists and molecular biologists to describe certain mutations in the genotype, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (with detection methods RFLPs and amplified fragment length polymorphism), that may not always correspond to a phenotype, but always corresponds to a branch in the genetic tree. See below.
