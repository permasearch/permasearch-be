Burney and Chandler soon formed the Folkadots, while Wiseman formed Gary & the Wiseman. Burney and Chandler, along with Morrill, also formed the band Slaw. Around this time, Reddick formed the band Terminal Seasons. Not too long after, Jaret Reddick and Lance Morrill formed coolfork!, which Chris Burney later joined. The band was in full swing by 1993, playing such venues as the Refuge. A few months later, after forming a band called Rubberneck, the group took the name Bowling for Soup (inspired by Bowling for Dollars) in 1994, and the band was officially formed in Wichita Falls on June 4, 1994 by Jaret Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Burney (guitar, backing vocals), Erik Chandler (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar), and Lance Morrill (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Morrill left the band in 1998 (on good terms) and was replaced by friend Gary Wiseman (joining in July 1998) of Gary and the Wisemen. The band's name was derived from a comedy act by Steve Martin.[2]
