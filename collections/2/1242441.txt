Lily was later written into a romance with Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) intertwined with a modeling career.[21] The couple was designed as star-crossed true loves,[35][36] and the relationship was said to add further growth to Lily's character.[37] Khalil said that Lily had been in "kind of an immature relationship" and she thought being with a "real man" would make Lily grow up and "start thinking about her life and situation in a different way" and "would change Lily for the better".[37] Goddard compared the romance to Lady Chatterley's Lover, as both characters grew and learned from the relationship.[38] Storylines for the lovers included the characters' age gap, a miscarriage and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller).[39][40] In the love-rectangle story, Chloe deceives Cane into thinking they conceived a child.[41][42] Goddard said he liked the storyline because of its originality. Love triangles and questioned paternity occur frequently in soap operas, but he felt that Maria Arena Bell made the plots fresh.[35][43] Khalil said that she "loved" the storyline and the actors in it;[44] she thought it "was a possibility" for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and Lily "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love each other in a more mature and honest way".[45] In 2009, the pair were married. For their wedding, Lily wore the dress her mother Drucilla (Victoria Rowell) wore at her 1995 wedding to Neil.[46][47][48] Rowell's dress was altered, at Khalil's request; she said it was an "old-fashioned, a typical '90s-style gown", and she "didn't really like it".[47] Khalil spoke with Bell and the head of the wardrobe department about updating the dress. Bell agreed; there were "little details" about the original dress she wanted to keep, and it became "a really beautiful dress".[47][48]
