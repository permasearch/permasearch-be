At the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gaslighting.  Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells.  The best telling of the phenol story is found in “The Aspirin Wars.”[96] Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate.  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.
