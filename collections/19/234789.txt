In South Korea, a sweet and sour meat dish known as tangsuyuk (탕수육) is one of the most popular Korean Chinese dishes. Made with either pork or beef, the bite-sized pieces are usually coated with potato/sweet potato/corn starch or glutinous rice flour, and double-fried in oil.[12][13][14] The dish is served with sweet and sour sauce, typically made by boiling vinegar, sugar, and water, with variety of fruits and vegetables like carrot, cucumber, onion, wood ear mushroom, and pineapple. Starch slurry is used to thicken the sauce.[12]
