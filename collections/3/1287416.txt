Although accounts left by visitors to the EsterhÃ¡zy estate indicate that the quartets were completed by 1797, an exclusivity agreement caused them not to be published until 1799.[1]  Correspondence between Haydn and his Viennese publishers Artaria reveal confusion as regards their release: Haydn had promised Messrs. Longman Clementi & Co. in London the first publishing rights, but a lack of communication led him to worry that their publication in Vienna might also be, unintentionally, their first appearance in full. In the event, their publication in London and Vienna was almost simultaneous.[1]
