In the 100th episode, Blair's wedding day finally arrives, along with a vengeful Georgina Sparks and her co-conspirator husband who are determined to ruin Blair's wedding by any means necessary. Meanwhile, Serena decides that she has to tell Dan how she feels while Nate unknowingly meets the real Charlie Rhodes working as a waitress at the reception. Elsewhere, Chuck must decide whether or not to make a final grand gesture to show Blair how he feels until Blair's mother, Eleanor, approaches him to persuade him to stop the wedding. Blair's estranged father Harold, and her stepfather, Cyrus, try to get Blair to choose one of them to escort her down the aisle, while Louis' mother, Sophia, again tries to tell him that Blair is not, and never will be, trustworthy. During the wedding, Gossip Girl leaks a video which shows Blair confessing her love for Chuck. However, an interrupted wedding continues and Blair is officially declared the Princess of Monaco. However, at the reception, Louis reveals to Blair that the wedding stands as contracted and "a show", and their love does not exist, to which Blair reacts in distress and runs away with Dan. The identity of Gossip Girl's successor is revealed at the end of the episode.
