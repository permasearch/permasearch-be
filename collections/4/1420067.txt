A library may make use of the Internet in a number of ways, from creating their own library website to making the contents of its catalogues searchable online. Some specialised search engines such as Google Scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers. The Online Computer Library Center allows anyone to search the world's largest repository of library records through its WorldCat online database.[154] Websites such as LibraryThing and Amazon provide abstracts, reviews, and recommendations of books.[154] Libraries provide computers and Internet access to allow people to search for information online.[155] Online information access is particularly attractive to younger library users.[156][157][158][159]
