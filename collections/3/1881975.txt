Triceratops were herbivorous, and because of their low head, their primary food was probably low growth, although they may have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk.[49][57] The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.[44]
