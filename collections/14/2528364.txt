ESPN described Ronaldinho as being "skillful by nature, his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet. One of the coolest players in pressure situations" and a "fast, brash, skilful, tricky, an uninhibited playmaker" who provides "a mix of goals, assists, skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves".[160] Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability: "There are not many players who can offer goalscoring passes like he can. He is just marvellous. He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere."[160] In spite of his performances at his peak, however, he was also criticised on occasion in the media for his lack of discipline in training, as well as his hedonistic lifestyle off the pitch, which some pundits believed had an impact on the overall longevity of his career.[161] Referring to Ronaldinho as “Brazil’s childlike genius who never grew up”, Tim Vickery writes that it was the tragic death of his father at such a young age that may have saw Ronaldinho stop making the sacrifices needed to remain at the summit of the sport, with the attitude of “life is short and can end unexpectedly–so enjoy it while you can.”[8]
