Thanos is eventually resurrected,[22] and collects the Infinity Gems once again.[23] He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.[24] This act and several other acts are soon undone by Nebula and Adam Warlock.[25] Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil[26] and then good[27] personas, and cure Thor of "warrior Madness".[28]
