In the United States, the competition between Bieber and One Direction began when the British boy band announced the release date of Made in the A.M., set to be their last album before their hiatus in March 2016.[128] Many compared the "war" between the two pop forces to 50 Cent and Kanye West's 2007 battle for number one.[129][130] However, Bieber's Purpose debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart for the week ending November 19, 2015, with 649,000 equivalent album units, including 522,000 traditional album sales.[131] It marked Bieber's sixth number-one album and largest sales week. It also surpassed his previous high, logged with Believe, which sold 374,000 units in 2012. Additionally, Purpose's debut marked the largest weekly unit total for an album since the Billboard 200 began tracking popularity based on overall equivalent units earned in 2014 and beat the debut week of Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late (which sold 535,000 equivalent units in 2015). Also, Purpose's 522,000 mark the largest sales week since Taylor Swift's 1989 debuted with 1.29 million (November 2, 2014) and the largest sales for a male artist album since Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2 sold 792,000 (November 3, 2013).[132] Purpose also broke the global and US streaming record for an album in its first week of release with 205 million global streams and 77 million in the United States.[133] In its second week, Purpose earned 290,000 units (down 55%). It sold 184,000 in traditional album sales (down 65%) and was beaten to the top by Adele's 25, which debuted at number one with a record-breaking 3.38 million.[134] In December 2015, the album surpassed the 1 million mark in US sales, becoming Bieber's fifth million-selling album.[135] Eventually, the album was announced as the third best-selling album of 2015 in the US, with sales of 1,269,000 copies.[136] As of December 2016, "Purpose" has sold 2.016 million copies in the nation.[137]
