The town was first take over by Charat Singh around 1760 together with other towns in the District.[2] Maharja Ranjit Singh occupied the town in 1809 and Avitabile was appointed as the Nazim of the city. He built an entirely new town, with a straight broad bazar running through it, and side streets at right angles.[2]
