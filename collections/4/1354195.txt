If the logical sector size is larger than 512 bytes, the remainder is not included in the checksum and is typically zero-filled.[22] Since some PC operating systems erroneously do not accept FAT formatted floppies if the 0x55 0xAA[nb 4] signature is not present here, it is advisable to place the 0x55 0xAA in this place (and add an IBM compatible boot loader or stub) and use an unused word in the private data or the boot code area or the serial number in order to ensure that the checksum 0x1234[nb 5] is not matched (unless the shared fat code overlay would be both IBM PC and Atari ST executable at the same time).
