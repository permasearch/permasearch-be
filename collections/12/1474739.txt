A particle's spin is generally represented in terms of spin operators. It turns out for particles that make up ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, electrons, quarks, etc.) particles are of spin 1/2,[3] meaning that only two eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian exist for a spin 1/2 state, implying that there are only two values of energy that can be measured. Thus showing that the inherent quantum property of energy quantization is a direct result of electron spin.
