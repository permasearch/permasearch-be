The jury found no place in the 1950 Indian Constitution, and it was ignored in many Indian states.[36] The Law Commission recommended its abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report.[36] Jury trials were abolished in India in most courts except for Matrimonial Disputes of Parsis by a very discrete process during the 1960s, finishing with the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, which is still in force today.[36]
