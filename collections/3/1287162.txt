Deep-fried food contests are frequently held at fairs such as the Texas State Fair, where they hold an annual contest for the most creative deep-fried food.[56] Notable past winners have included fried Coke and deep-fried butter, both invented by Abel Gonzales.[57] Since 2013, an American reality competition show called deep-fried Masters, produced by Discovery Networks, holds deep frying competitions at several state fairs across the country.[58]
