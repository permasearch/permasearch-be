Often, violations of the laws of war are confused with violations of rules of engagement. Command responsibility is one means to distinguish between the two. The rules of engagement is a standard internal to the military, composed of orders that the military has deemed that its forces should follow during an operation. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions that have been ratified by U.S. Senate are U.S. law under Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution. Likewise, the laws of war are part of international law, and also have the status of law, as recognized by the Supreme Court in The Paquete Habana. Breaches of treaties such as the Geneva Conventions and other laws of war might, therefore, fall outside of the ROE.
