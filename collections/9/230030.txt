"It's a Long Way to Tipperary" is a British music hall song written by Jack Judge and co-credited to Henry James "Harry" Williams.[1] It was allegedly written for a 5-shilling bet in Stalybridge on 30 January 1912 and performed the next night at the local music hall. Now commonly called "It's a Long Way to Tipperary", the original printed music calls it "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary." It became popular among soldiers in the First World War and is remembered as a song of that war.
