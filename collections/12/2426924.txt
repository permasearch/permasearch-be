On the night of February 10, 1981, an arson fire started at the Las Vegas Hilton, which at the time was being retrofitted with modern fire safety equipment. Firefighters, using the knowledge they had learned from the MGM Grand fire, used local television networks to notify people to stay in their rooms and not go out to the halls and stairwells. Because of the lessons learned, only eight people died in this fire compared with the 85 people who died in the MGM Grand fire. Famed singer Natalie Cole was trapped inside the Hilton during the fire, possibly sustaining lung damage from smoke inhalation that was not detected by doctors in 1981.[5] In 1982, Philip Bruce Cline was sentenced to eight life sentences for his role in starting the fire.[6]
