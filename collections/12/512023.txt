In addition to such public plans as Medicare and Medicaid, the federal government also sponsors a health benefit plan for federal employeesâ€”the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). FEHBP provides health benefits to full-time civilian employees. Active-duty service members, retired service members and their dependents are covered through the Department of Defense Military Health System (MHS). FEHBP is managed by the federal Office of Personnel Management.
