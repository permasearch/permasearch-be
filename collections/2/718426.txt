The EDA provides instructions for making a protein called ectodysplasin A.[66] It encodes transmembrane protein that is part of TNF (tumour necrosis factor) family of ligands. EDA gene defects cause ectodermal dysplasia, which is also known as X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.[67]  Common dental features of ectodermal dysplasia are multiple missing teeth and microdontia.[68]
