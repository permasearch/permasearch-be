The Street scenes, as Palmer described them, were "the glue" that "pulled the show together",[85] so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. On the basis of their experience on Captain Kangaroo, Cannell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts' opinions were "nonsense";[86] Cooney agreed.[71] Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street".[85] The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,[85][87] specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters.[78] In addition, the producers found Saunders' role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by Matt Robinson,[67] who was initially the show's filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly responsible for what Gladwell called "the essence of Sesame Streetâ€”the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults".[85][note 14]
