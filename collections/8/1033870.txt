The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. Polygon's Kollar called the game's locations "beautiful",[18] while Eurogamer's Harman wrote that the level design significantly improved the environments.[15] Moriarty of IGN praised the setting within the mall, due to its regularity in "the real, pre-apocalyptic world".[2] Mc Shea of GameSpot also felt that the game's focus on exploration allowed the "well-realized environments [to] breathe",[17] and Martin of The Daily Telegraph noted that Ellie's body size allowed for "quieter and faster" movement throughout the environments.[22]
