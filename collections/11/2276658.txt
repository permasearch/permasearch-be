The distance at which a planet can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapmanâ€“Ferraro distance. This is modeled by a formula wherein      R  P     {\displaystyle R_{P}}   represents the radius of the planet,      B  s u r f     {\displaystyle B_{surf}}   represents the magnetic field on the surface of the planet at the equator, and      V  S W     {\displaystyle V_{SW}}   represents the velocity of the solar wind:
