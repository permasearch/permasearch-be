Obateru is the first black person to buy the 2014 model of Bentley automobile.[5] On July 2013, in an interview with The Sun, Obateru said: "The first time I saw a car was 1961 in Sapele. At that time, Sir Festus Okotie-Eboh had a hotel in Sapele, Waterside Hotel. It was the first time I saw a hotel in my life. We used to describe hotels as bars. That was the first time I knew the difference between a hotel and a bar."[6]
