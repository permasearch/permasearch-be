That cultural differentiation was especially noticeable in the books and paintings of early Oriental studies, the European examinations of the Orient, which misrepresented the East as irrational and backward, the opposite of the rational and progressive West.[26][29] Defining the East as a negative vision of the Western world, as its inferior, not only increased the sense-of-self of the West, but also was a way of ordering the East, and making it known to the West, so that it could be dominated and controlled.[30][31] Therefore, Orientalism was the ideological justification of early Western imperialismâ€”a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other, non-white peoples.[28][32]
