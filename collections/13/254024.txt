The biblical perception that people with leprosy were unclean may be connected to a passage from Leviticus 13: 44-46, among others. Judeo-Christian belief, for some, held that leprosy was of moral consequence, and, as in many societies, early Christians believed that those affected by leprosy were being punished by God for sinful behavior. Moral associations have persisted throughout history. Pope Gregory the Great (540-604) and Isidor of Seville (560-636) considered people with the disease to be heretics.[78]
