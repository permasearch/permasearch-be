For assessment with flow cytometry the washed cells are incubated with the chosen probe, (possibly washed again) and then sampled in a flow cytometer.  After gating the cell population according to forward- and side-scatter the resulting data can be analysed (E.g. mean fluorescences compared).  With this technique a probe for viability, like propidium iodide (PI) could also be included in order to exclude dead cells from the acrosome assessment, since many sperm cells will spontaneously lose their acrosome when they die.
