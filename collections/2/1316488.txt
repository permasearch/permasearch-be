While some of those factors, like age, race or gender, are random,[7] Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification – how social class, social status and political affiliation affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain groups have in common a specific causal component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of economic factors:[8][9] how the power of those with property, compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.[9]
