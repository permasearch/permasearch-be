A replacement throne that closely resembled the original was probably constructed for the Mughal emperor, after the Persian invasion.[17] The throne was located on the eastern side of the Divan-i-Khas, towards the windows. This throne however was also lost, possibly during or after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent looting and partial destruction of the Red Fort by the British.[18] The marble pedestal on which it rested has survived and can still be seen today.[19][20]
