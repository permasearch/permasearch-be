The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan, Stan Winston and Jeffrey Abelson.[6] A T-800 Terminator is assembled, given the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and dispatched to assassinate the band at one of their concerts. The video consists of clips from the movie, including its teaser trailer, intercut with footage of the band performing the song as the T-800 makes its way to the front of the crowd. After the song ends, it confronts the band as they leave the venue through a back door and analyzes each member individually; Izzy Stradlin is absent at this point, replaced by a man named Dizzy. The T-800 scans W. Axl Rose last and concludes that killing the band would be a "Waste of Ammo." Lowering its shotgun, it gives Rose a brief smirk and walks away.
