Stacy and Tracy Oboe â€“ Smart, nerdy twin sisters who both play the oboe. They are both extremely shy; they would never talk to anyone but each other, and were afraid to be apart. In the episode "'Shyness," Ned and Moze tried to help the twins overcome their shyness, though Tracy did so by copying another person almost exactly and putting "tr" before the vowel (i.e. with Lisa she called herself Trisa).
