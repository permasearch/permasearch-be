There are three formats of the album; a 'Deluxe Edition' which includes a bonus 24 minute documentary feature on "The Making of NWFT" with interviews, footage from the studio, three never before heard acoustic demos (the other two from In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 had previously leaked), a booklet with scenes from The Amory Wars, and over 50 photos from recent tours; a 'stripped' version, containing just the CD and a slip sleeve cover; and a 'double gatefold vinyl' version, in which the album comes on 2 LPs, featuring artwork by Ken Kelly. If pre-ordered, they would come with an autographed booklet but stock ran out the day after the prerelease was announced. Another promotional item, the No World for Tomorrow magnet, is still in stock.[10]
