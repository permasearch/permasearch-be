Outside opinion By clicking on the geocoords and going to wikimapia, I see the falls labeled where the geocoords pointed; zoomed in, it is here: [57]. Assuming the area visible in the aerial photo is indeed the falls, switching it to map view and zooming out a few clicks makes the state borders visible. To me, it looks to be on the border.
