Of all of Keats's poems, "To Autumn", with its catalogue of concrete images,[15] most closely describes a paradise as realized on earth while also focusing on archetypal symbols connected with the season. Within the poem, autumn represents growth, maturation, and finally an approaching death. There is a fulfilling union between the ideal and the real.[16]
