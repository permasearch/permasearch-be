The Post Position Draw of the entries for the Kentucky Derby was held Wednesday, May 4, 2016 at the Churchill Downs Racetrack clubhouse.[6] After the draw was made, the undefeated Nyquist was installed as the 3-1 morning line favorite.[7] In spite of having been undefeated in his seven previous races and having already defeated several of the other entries, including second-favorite Exaggerator, Nyquist was viewed as vulnerable, in part because of the statistical improbability of the race favorite winning for four years in a row.[8] Pundits also noted the unusual number of gray horses in the field, four in total and three of them sons of Tapit, a gray stallion who is ranked as the leading sire in America.[9]
