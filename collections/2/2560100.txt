At the front of the court, on a raised platform, is a large bench. This is where the judge sits.[14] His/her rank can be distinguished by the colour of gown worn, and different forms of address are appropriate for different ranks of judge, with "Your Honour" used for circuit judges and recorders at most locations, and "My Lord" or "My Lady" being used for High Court Judges, as well as for all judges at the Central Criminal Court. The judge enters and exits the court from a door typically at the side of the platform, preceded by a cry of "All Rise" from the usher or clerk of the court who sits below and in front of the judge's bench. Everyone present is required to show their subjection to the court by standing as the judge enters (or exits) until he/she sits down.
