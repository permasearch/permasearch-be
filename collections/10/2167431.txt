Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally.[25][43] Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development.[43] In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants[43] and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease.[44][45] This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections.[46] Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent.[47][48][49] The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age.[25] The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over 2 years.[50]
