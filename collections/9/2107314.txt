It has been confirmed through The Fall of Five that Albert is a male and is the oldest of the Cêpans.  He later dies on Earth around the time Number Five states that he was found by the Mogs within the first six months he arrived on Earth from Lorien.  His death was caused by a "vile human disease", as said by Five, not by the Mogadorians like the rest of the Cêpans.  However, his real name is revealed to be "Rey" instead of "Albert" in "Five's Legacy". He might be the "Kentra" mentioned in "The Lost Days of Lorien"
