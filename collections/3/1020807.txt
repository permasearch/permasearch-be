In Dasam Granth, the Sikh scripture attributed to the tenth Sikh guru Guru Gobind Singh prophesizes the Mahdi (referred to as "Mahdi Meer") to be born for a purpose of defeating Kalki. As Kalki becomes egoistic and begins referring to himself as the Almighty, the powerful Mahdi will slay him and rule the world and when Mahdi Meer walks the same line as the Kalki Avtaar, i.e., equating himself with God, then he also will die from an insect created by God, which will enter into his body and will disease him.
