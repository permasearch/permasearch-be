Opponents[who?] also cite the genetic health and social behaviors of species because hunters often kill the largest male. This crumbles the social make up, if applicable, which can then disrupt both the immediate safety of the other animals and the reproductive health of the species in the long-run. This indicates the animals that are left to reproduce are not the strongest or healthiest to pass on genetic codes to future offspring.[citation needed]
