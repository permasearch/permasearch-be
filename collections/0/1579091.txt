Macdonald was replaced by Colin Quinn, who started on the first episode after Macdonald had been removed, and served through the 1999â€“2000 season. His first edition of Weekend Update began with "Have you ever gone to a bar and found that your favorite bartender was replaced with a guy named Steve? -pause- Well I'm Steve, what can I get you?" His sign-off was "I'm Colin Quinn, that's my story and I'm sticking to it" (a line from the Collin Raye song "That's My Story").
