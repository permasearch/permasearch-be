Although it is touched on briefly, I feel the article fails to document the extent to which ToT is *extremely* unpopular in most parts of England, where it has no historical tradition. At best it is perceived as adults allowing their children to go out begging (generally a taboo practice in England, and dangerous too) and at worst as a form of demanding money with menaces practised by teenage thugs. It leads to widespread antisocial behaviour and leaves some elderly people in genuine fear for their safety. The practice is pushed hard by supermarkets, particularly the Wal-Mart owned Asda. Some parents feel pressured to allow their children to do it through pester power, and of course some just don't care. Thanks America. --Ef80 (talk) 19:15, 22 October 2009 (UTC)
