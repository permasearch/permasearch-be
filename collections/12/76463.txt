Women's suffrage was granted after about two decades of campaigning by women such as Kate Sheppard and Mary Ann MÃ¼ller and organisations such as the New Zealand branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. On 19 September 1893 the governor, Lord Glasgow, signed a new Electoral Act into law.[49] As a result, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections.[7] Women first voted in the 1893 election, with a high 85% turnout (compared to 70% of men).[50]
