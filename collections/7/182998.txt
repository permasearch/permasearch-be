On April 23, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the raising of a  colonial army consisting of 26 company regiments.  New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut soon raised similar but smaller forces. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000).[2] It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia to be used as light infantry,[2] who became the 1st Continental Regiment in 1776.
