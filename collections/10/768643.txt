On September 13, 2000 Apple released a $29.95[11] "preview" version of Mac OS X (internally codenamed Kodiak) in order to gain feedback from users.[12] It marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface, and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001.[13]
