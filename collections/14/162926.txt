Jughead was a sophomore at Riverdale High School but following the arrest of his father F.P. Jones, the leader of the Southside Serpents, he was placed into foster care and, as a result, had to transfer to Southside High. While attending the gang and drug-infested high school, he re-opened the school newspaper, The Red and Black, where he was an editor, alongside new recruit, Toni Topaz, the newspaper's photographer, with Robert Phillips, their adviser until his arrest. However, with the closing of Southside High, Jughead has since returned to Riverdale High. He is a close friend of Archie Andrews and Betty Cooper, with whom heâ€™s in a relationship with. He is also a member of the Southside Serpents, which he recently joined following his father's arrest, despite being advised against it, which he has yet to be reprimanded for.
