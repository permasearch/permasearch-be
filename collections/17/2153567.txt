In this case Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo handling job. Invoking seniority he transferred to a less demanding mailroom job but this position later became open to seniority based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees. Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less demanding mailroom job. US Airways denied his request and he lost his job.
