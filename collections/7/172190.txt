The Fab Five, the 1991 recruiting class of five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having gone to the championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts,[36][37] which was later popularized by Michael Jordan,[38] and for wearing black athletic socks.[38][39] Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited.[38] Although Webber was the only member of the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished.[40] Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans.[3][41] and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors.[18] All but Jackson played in the NBA.[42] They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream,[43] which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie.[44] In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.
