Stewart Gilligan[1] "Stewie" Griffin is a main character from the American animated television series Family Guy. Initially obsessed with violence and matricide, Stewie (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the youngest child of Peter and Lois Griffin, and the brother of Meg and Chris Griffin. Over the duration of the series, the violent aspects of Stewie's personality have been toned down, and he has evolved into a more eccentric, flamboyant character. He has also come to have a very close friendship with the family's anthropomorphic dog, Brian. Stewie is considered to be the show's breakout character.[2] Wizard magazine rated him the 95th greatest villain of all time.[3]
