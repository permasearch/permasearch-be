In the late 1990s, the company ran into financial trouble, losing money, deferring maintenance, and closing 12 of its locations. In 1999 the Rector family sold the chain to Florida businessman, Robert Swain, for $7.6 million. Swain tried to expand the business's geographic coverage into Massachusetts and Connecticut. The expansion was unsuccessful, and was followed by contraction.[4] The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2000.[7] In 2001, Jan Companies, a local Burger King franchisee, purchased the company for only $1.55 million.[8]
