In October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson,[240] but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day.[241] In several songs on Doctor's Advocate, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy,[242] and apologized for his actions.[243] According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology[244] and The Game has resumed his calls for a "G-Unot" boycott at concerts. Jackson released "So Disrespectful" on Before I Self Destruct, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck.[245] The Game responded with "Shake", poking fun at the music video for Jackson's "Candy Shop".
