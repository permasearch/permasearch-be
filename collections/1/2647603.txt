In 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem (named "God Save the Queen") at the end of BBC One transmissions each day since the practice's halt in 1997,[23] to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain's subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, the BBC's Newsnight programme ended its nightly broadcast with a statement that it was happy to accede to Rosindell's request. The production crew however instead played out with a clip of the Sex Pistols' similarly named song, much to Rosindell's discontent.[24]
