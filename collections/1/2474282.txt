French and British naval forces had cleared the Red Sea of Ottoman gunboats early in the war.[29] The port of Jidda was attacked by 3500 Arabs on 10 June 1916 with the assistance of bombardment by British warships and seaplanes.[26] The seaplane carrier HMSÂ Ben-my-Chree provided crucial air support to the Hashemite forces.[30] The Ottoman garrison surrendered on 16 June.[26] By the end of September 1916 Arab armies had taken the coastal cities of Rabegh, Yenbo, Qunfida, and 6000 Ottoman prisoners with the assistance of the Royal Navy.[26] The capture of the Red Sea ports allowed the British to send over a force of 700 Ottoman Arab POWs (who primarily came from what is now Iraq) who had decided to join the revolt led by Nuri as-Sa'id and a number of Muslim troops from French North Africa.[30] Fifteen thousand well-armed Ottoman troops remained in the Hejaz.[26] However, a direct attack on Medina in October resulted in a bloody repulse of the Arab forces.
