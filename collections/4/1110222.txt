Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations.[54] LGBT people in some parts of the world have very little legal protection from DV, because engaging in homosexual acts is itself prohibited by the "sodomy laws" of those jurisdictions (as of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by imprisonment in 70 countries and by death in another 5 countries)[193] and these legal prohibitions prevent LGBT victims of DV from reporting the abuse to authorities.[194] In the face of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, 13 US states have refused to remove sodomy laws from legislation as of 2013.[188]
