Lee Marvin accepted the lead role instead of appearing in The Wild Bunch.[2] He received $1 million while Eastwood was paid $750,000.[2][5] Faye Dunaway turned down the role of Elizabeth before Seberg was cast.[6] Diana Rigg and Julie Andrews were also considered for the role.[2] Eastwood and Marvin did their own singing while Seberg's songs were dubbed. The early incarnation of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had a cameo in the song "Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans". Some songs from the original musical were dropped and some were added by Alan Jay Lerner and André Previn, while others were used in different contexts.
