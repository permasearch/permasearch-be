Indio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso which has a disguised safe containing "almost a million dollars". Manco arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, who arrived earlier. He sees Mortimer deliberately insult the hunchback Wild (Kinski), who is reconnoitring the bank. Manco confronts Mortimer and, as neither will give way, they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades Manco to join Indio's gang and "get him between two fires". Manco frees a friend of Indio from prison and, despite Indio's suspicions, is accepted into the gang.
