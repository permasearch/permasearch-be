Almost three years after the Philippine Independence in 4 July 1946, two towns broke off from the municipality, namely: Padada, on 15 July 1949; and Digos on 19 July in the same year. In 1960's, a new municipality, Roxas, was carved out from the town, covering the present-day barangays of Inauayan, Darong, Astorga, Coronon, and Sibulan; however, the Supreme Court of the Philippines nullified the creation of the municipality since this meant the collapse of the jurisdiction of once the most Christianized town in Mindanao.
