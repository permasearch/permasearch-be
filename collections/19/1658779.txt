Foucault was an atheist.[161][162] He was also a fan of classical music, particularly enjoying the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,[163] and became known for wearing turtleneck jumpers.[164] After his death, Foucault's friend Georges Dum√©zil described him as having possessed "a profound kindness and goodness", also exhibiting an "intelligence [that] literally knew no bounds."[165] His life-partner Daniel Defert inherited his estate.[citation needed]
