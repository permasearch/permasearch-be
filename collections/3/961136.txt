It was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavoured drink, was launched in France. It was launched in other countries later,[51] including Belgium and Luxembourg in September. The drink had first been developed to start by Coca-Cola in 2001 in Belgium.[52] The drink is targeted for adults, and is low in sugar with four flavors in 2014.[51]
