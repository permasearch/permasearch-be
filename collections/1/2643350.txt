A cephalohaematoma (British English) or cephalohematoma (American English) is a hemorrhage of blood between the skull and the periosteum of any age human, including a newborn baby secondary to rupture of blood vessels crossing the periosteum.  Because the swelling is subperiosteal, its boundaries are limited by the individual bones, in contrast to a caput succedaneum.
