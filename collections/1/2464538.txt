In mid-October, it was speculated that the band had settled their differences with original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop and that some sort of collaborative effort would be made after several pictures were posted of Worsnop and Bruce in the studio together.[80] However, it was revealed two days later that Worsnop had actually returned to the band as an official member after the departure of Denis Stoff. Ben Bruce explained that after a long period of time of not communicating with the band, Stoff stated, "Asking Alexandria does not exist unless I get what’s owed to me".[81][82] Worsnop also opened up about his return to the band, stating that "this is something that [he] can embrace again".[83] When the band performed again for the first time with Worsnop since Stoff's departure, their set list excluded all songs from their most recent album The Black and instead consisted of songs that they had not performed in years.[84] As time went on more information regarding Stoff had been released, such as that Stoff had lip-synced the band's older songs during live performances, an accusation made by Worsnop's lawyers who notified him after sending Stoff a cease and desist. When asked about Stoff's time as his replacement, Worsnop replied stating that "Replace is a strong word. He was just keeping my seat warm. Honestly, I don’t know the kid so I have no opinion of him as a person…”[85][86] Stoff claims that his departure was due to personal stress caused by the unrest in his home country of Ukraine.[87]
