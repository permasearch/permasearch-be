The gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the Pallava kings, and relate to the central shikhara towers of North India.  Between the twelfth and sixteenth century, during the Pandya, Nayaka and Vijayanagara era when Hindu temples increasingly became a hub of the urban life, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the gopuram's colossal size and courtyards.[4] It also dominated the inner sanctum in amount of ornamentation. Often a shrine has more than one gopuram.[1] They also appear in architecture outside India, especially Khmer architecture, as at Angkor Wat.
