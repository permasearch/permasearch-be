Eustace has a greater role as a dragon in the film such as not only allowed to proceed with the ship to the next islands in that state, but also proves a valuable asset for the crew for the remainder of the voyage. This is so he could take a major part in the action and not merely do expedition work duty as in the book. The book's stream of consciousness description about Eustace gradually realizing that he had become a dragon while sleeping is effective as text, but it could not easily be translated onto film. Further, a noted passage from the book where Aslan peels Eustace's dragon skin off in layers is not used.[33] Walden President Micheal Flaherty remarked about it that "people don't earn grace; they receive it once they are humbled and aware of their need."[31][34] The old dragon which Eustace finds, and sees it die of old age, in the valley in the book, is not used in the film.
