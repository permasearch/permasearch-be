Starting in 2016, construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel will take seven to eight years, giving a target completion date of 2023.[2] Once constructed, the main tunnel will have an internal diameter of 7.2 m (24 ft) and will run from −30 m (−98 ft) at Acton in the west of London for over 25 km (16 mi) under central London down to −70 m (−230 ft) at Abbey Mills in the east.
