The Time Act 1974 empowered the Governor-General to declare by Order in Council a period when daylight saving time is to be observed.[9] This was a one-hour shift (on top of the earlier half hour shift) from the first Sunday in November to the last Sunday in February, promptly changed the next year by The New Zealand Time Order 1975 which fixed the period of observance from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in March.
