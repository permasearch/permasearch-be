In 2000, a facelift (designed in mid-1999) was introduced for the 2001 model year, which was the only year with any major changes in the second generation GS. New clear tail lights with turn signal indicators were added to the trunk area, as well as a slightly revised grille and very subtly tinted headlights on the front end. Xenon high-intensity discharge headlights were now standard on the V8 and optional on the straight-six. Inside, more wood trim was added, and steering wheel shift buttons were now also featured on the GS 300. The V8 engine also received a 0.3-liter increase in displacement and the model was renamed GS 430 (UZS161). Peak power was unchanged, but torque increased to 441 N⋅m (325 lb⋅ft). The GS 430 took 5.7 seconds to do 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h). For the 2001 model year, Lexus also added a limited production GS 300 "SportDesign" edition for North America, featuring the sport suspension from the GS 430, wider tires, and polished alloy wheels.[13] The SportDesign interior added perforated leather upholstery along with brushed aluminum and dark stained walnut trim. For the third quarter of 2001, production of the GS 300 SportDesign was limited to a run of 3,300 units (vs. 25,000 annual GS sales annually).[13] Production of the limited model occurred through 2004.
