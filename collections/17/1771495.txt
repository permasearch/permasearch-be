Is the OriginalAirDate becoming outdated, and perhaps needing to become something more like "OriginalAvailabilityDate"? More and more channels morph into a sort of On-Demand system, where content is made available on a different date than the classical "TV Programming". Content Management systems are starting to mature, in such a way that they are less and less intrusive, plus the ability to splice commercials into the episodes with these systems that are difficult to block make this all possible (and profitable) for these networks. Showtime already shows some episodes before the TV programming, and I think HBO does as well, but don't quote me on that. This tendency towards on-demand systems isn't likely to slow down, therefor the classical programming schedule will probably go the way of the dodo in the coming decades, or years (although I don't think Classic TV channels will really completely go away, if only for national information channels etc.). Would it be convenient to either change this parameter, or add a parameter next to it that shows the original (and legal) availability date? Xiph1980 (talk) 16:44, 27 February 2013 (UTC)
