Here the first sort is done using column 2. -k2,2 specifies sorting on the key starting and ending with column 2. If -k2 is used instead, the sort key would begin at column 2 and extend to the end of the line, spanning all the fields in between. The n stands for 'numeric ordering'. -k1,1 dictates breaking ties using the value in column 1, sorting alphabetically by default. Note that bob, an and chad have the same quota and are sorted alphabetically in the final output.
