Rwanda's legal system is largely based on German and Belgian civil law systems and customary law.[59] The judiciary is independent of the executive branch,[85] although the President and the Senate are involved in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.[86] Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty,[87] but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions.[88] The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised.[89] Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts[89] and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations.[90] Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation.[91] Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects.[92] The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.[93]
