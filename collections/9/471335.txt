Traditionally, the Merseyside derby was referred to as the "friendly derby" because of the large number of families with both Liverpool and Everton supporters[2] and was one of the few that did not enforce total fan segregation.[3] The 1984 Football League Cup Final at Wembley saw almost all sections of the ground mixed and combined chants of "Merseyside, Merseyside" and "Are you watching Manchester?"[citation needed] Since the mid-1980s, however, the rivalry has intensified on and off the field, and since the inception of the Premier League has had more red cards than any other game.[4][5]
