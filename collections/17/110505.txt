Since 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of New Order, no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats, resulting in coalition governments. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan), which secured the most votes in the 2014 elections, is the party of the current President, Joko Widodo.[112] The Great Indonesia Movement Party (Partai Gerindra) is the third largest political party.[113] Other notable parties include Party of the Functional Groups (Partai Golkar), Democratic Party (Partai Demokrat), and National Awakening Party (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa). The current DPR consists of 10 political parties, with a parliamentary threshold of 3.5% of the national vote.[114]
