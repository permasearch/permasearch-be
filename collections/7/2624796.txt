On Sukkot, Leviticus 22:26â€“23:44, which sets forth the holidays throughout the year, and the sacrifices for each, is read on both the first day, and on the second day, which is only observed in the diaspora.[23] This reading is also read on the second day of Passover, again observed only in the diaspora.
