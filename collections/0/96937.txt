The rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in Brahmagupta's Brahmasputha Siddhanta (7thÂ century). This work considers not only zero, but negative numbers, and the algebraic rules for the elementary operations of arithmetic with such numbers. In some instances, his rules differ from the modern standard, specifically the definition of the value of zero divided by zero as zero.[37]
