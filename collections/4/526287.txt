In early 1987, Agnetha recorded an album "Kom följ med i vår karusell" ("Come Join Us on Our Carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album Agnetha recorded duets with her son and with a choir of children. She also recorded a few solo songs. The single "På Söndag" ("On Sunday") was much played at the radio and even made the Swedish top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.
