In the database container or navigation pane in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., table, query, macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, though this is not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule.[34][35] It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for tables, qry for queries).
