Although an important character to the Psycho story, Norma only appears as a corpse in the original films and sequels. She is not depicted as a living character until the 1990 prequel/sequel film Psycho IV: The Beginning, portrayed by Olivia Hussey. Vera Farmiga later portrayed Norma in the television series Bates Motel (2013 - 2017) which retells the Psycho story over the years prior to the events of the novel and film.
