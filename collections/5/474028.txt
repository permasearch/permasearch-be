In July 2016, Edward Snowden criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content.[26] When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs.[26] Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld.[26] WikiLeaks, on the other hand, makes little effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[26]
