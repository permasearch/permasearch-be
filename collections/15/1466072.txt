Section 37 of the Militia act of 1807 again addressed the formation of volunteer or independent troops of horse and companies of artillery, grenadiers, light infantry, and riflemen. Service in these independent companies was by encouraged by exempting members from fines for failure to attend musters of the regular militia and "[e]very trooper who shall enroll himself for this service, having furnished himself with a horse, uniform clothing and other accoutrements, shall hold the same exempted from taxes, and all civil prosecutions, during his continuance in said corps".[22]
