Thompson has been a campaigner since her youth.[160] Since becoming a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues, prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken.[160] In 2010, The Daily Telegraph asked: "Emma Thompson: a national treasure or Britain's most annoying woman?"[161] She has justified her assertiveness by saying, "what I feel is that we all need to speak up and a woman who has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed."[160]
