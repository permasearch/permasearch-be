After fifteen years of working for other companies,[4] Fossett founded his own firms, Marathon Securities and Lakota Trading, from which he made millions renting exchange memberships.[1][9][12] He founded Lakota Trading for that purpose in 1980.[13] In the early 1980s,[4] he founded Marathon Securities and extended that successful formula to memberships on the New York stock exchanges. He earned millions renting floor trading privileges (exchange memberships) to hopeful new floor traders, who would also pay clearing fees to Fossett's clearing firms in proportion to the trading activity of those renting the memberships. In 1997, the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange.[6] Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in London.[4] Fossett would later use those revenues to finance his adventures.[1][9][12] Fossett said, "As a floor trader, I was very aggressive and worked hard. Those same traits help me in adventure sports."[6]
