The east coast of the United States provided a specifically dense area for raw materials especially around Massachusetts. There was an abundance of oak forests that provided wood for the ships.[13] In the late 1680s “there were more than 2 dozen sawmills around the Maine and Massachusetts areas[14] These sawmills, along with a dense supply of wood, helped to increase the business of colonial shipbuilding. The wood was usually white oak, but “cedars, chestnuts, and black oaks were perfect for the underwater portion of the ships.”[15] Demand was high for wood, colonial Americans needed faster ways of producing more wood. This led to inventions of different types of sawmills. One of the first types of sawmills was the water sawmill. This process allowed for faster, more efficient wood to be made for shipbuilding. “Early sawmills simply adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel to speed up the process.”[16]
