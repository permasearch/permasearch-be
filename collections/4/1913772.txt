The Glassâ€“Steagall Act of 1933 was passed in reaction to the collapse of a large portion of the American commercial banking system in early 1933.  One of its provisions introduced the separation of bank types according to their business (commercial and investment banking).   In order to comply with the new regulation, most large banks split into separate entities. For example, JP Morgan split into three entities: JP Morgan continued to operate as a commercial bank, Morgan Stanley was formed to operate as an investment bank, and Morgan Grenfell operated as a British merchant bank.[29]
