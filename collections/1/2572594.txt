Historical research throws serious doubts on whether the incident actually ever occurred. Hitler took his second leave from military service on 10 September 1918 for 18 days. This means that he was in Germany on the presumed date of the facts.[22] Having a great sense for theatrical drama, Hitler may well have created the story upon seeing the painting for propaganda reasons and to contribute to his mythical status.
