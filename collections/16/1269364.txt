On the night before the Veto ceremony, Danielle and Jason decided to strike a final five deal with the Ballsmashers alliance with the promise to backdoor Justin. However, Danielle and Jason were not genuine with this deal and only made it to blindside them. On Day 42, Jason used the Power of Veto on Danielle, and he chose Morgan as the replacement nominee. On Day 43, Alex was evicted from the Big Brother house by a unanimous vote of 4-0-0.
