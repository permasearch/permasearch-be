As the immune system is relatively conserved between zebrafish and humans, many human infectious diseases can be modeled in zebrafish.[72][73][74][75] The transparent early life stages are well suited for in vivo imaging and genetic dissection of host-pathogen interactions.[76][77][78][79] Zebrafish models for a wide range of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have already been established; for example, the zebrafish model for tuberculosis provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of mycobacteria.[80][81][82][83] Furthermore, robotic technology has been developed for high-throughput antimicrobial drug screening using zebrafish infection models.[84][85]
