Snowballs is a giant snow monster can breathe fire (despite the fact that it is made of ice) who appears in "Appreciation Day". It is brought to life by Mordecai and Rigby after they foolish write lies in the book of park records. It steals the book and rips out its pages while wreaking havoc in the park. Although the duo manage to collect all the pages, Snowballs still had the book's cover, which is needed to defeat the monster. Skips and Rigby both manage to retrieve the cover from Snowballs, allowing Mordecai to write an ending to make Snowballs disappear.
