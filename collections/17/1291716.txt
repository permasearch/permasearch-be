In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London published the forerunner of the electric clock, the electrostatic clock.[146] It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather.[147] He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable across a range of meteorological conditions.[148]
