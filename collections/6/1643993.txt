Silanes are named by adding the suffix -silane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix. Hence, disilane, Si 2H 6; trisilane Si 3H 8; tetrasilane Si 4H 10; pentasilane Si 5H 12; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, with the exceptions of nonasilane which has a Latin prefix, and undecasilane and tridecasilane which have mixed-language prefixes.
