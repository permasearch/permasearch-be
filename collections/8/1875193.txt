In the Mistborn universe, magic is depicted as a supernatural force harnessed by three distinct disciplines: Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy. All three magic systems are based on metals, which are used by the magician to grant them specific abilities. Their power originates in the Shards, Preservation and Ruin; the two god-like deities that are present in the Mistborn world.
