The mine comprises nineteen stories, of which eleven are below ground. From the entrance, the mine extends about 730 meters (2440 ft) into the mountains, and the total length of its tunnels is about 40 km (25 miles).[4][30] Quarrying is done using the room and pillar method, mining only half of the salt and leaving the remaining half to support what is above.[31] The temperature inside the mine remains about 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) throughout the year.[15] The 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge Khewra Salt Mines Railway track laid during the British era is used to bring salt out of the mine in rail cars.[13]
