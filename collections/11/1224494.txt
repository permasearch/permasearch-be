When the truth about Connie comes out, Maxie and Spinelli decide that they want their daughter back. Lulu decides she wants to keep the baby, and all four go to court, where Lulu and Maxie attack each other. The judge grants Spinelli sole custody of Connie, with Maxie being barred from seeing her daughter for six months. Devastated over losing her daughter, Maxie tries to commit suicide, but she's stopped by Robin, revealed to be alive. When Ellie finds a job in Portland, Spinelli is reluctant to follow because of Maxie and their daughter. However, Maxie encourages him to go with the baby so she won't violate the court ruling. Before leaving with Ellie, Spinelli reveals he's decided to rename their daughter Georgie, in honor of Maxie's sister. After they leave, Maxie decides to leave town to find a way to move on.
