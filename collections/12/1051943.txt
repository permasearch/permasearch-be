Briarcliff Entertainment released the documentary in 1,719 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018, the widest-ever for a Moore film; it was released alongside Life Itself, The House With a Clock in Its Walls, and Assassination Nation.[13] Based on early tracking, Fahrenheit 11/9 was initially expected to gross $4â€“10 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. Variety said the opening-weekend gross "won't come close to trumping" Fahrenheit 9/11, which grossed $23.9 million at 868 theaters in the United States and Canada.[14][15] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 82%, including an average 4.5 out of 5 stars.[16] After making just $1.1 million on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $3 million. The film went on to debut to just $3.1 million[17], finishing eighth with a per-theater average of $1,804. Deadline Hollywood noted the film should have begun a limited run in larger cities (such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Chicago, where it ended up performing best) and built up positive word-of-mouth, instead of going wide to over 1,000 theaters in its opening weekend.[16] It fell 63% in its second weekend to $1.1 million, finishing 12th.  To date, it has grossed $6.2 million domestically.  [18]
