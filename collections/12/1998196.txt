Lady Annabelle Comstock (Laura Bailey) is the wife of Zachary Hale Comstock and the adoptive mother of Elizabeth. Shortly after meeting Comstock, she became one of his most dedicated followers, but soon became disillusioned when Comstock resorted to increasingly violent tactics to impose his will on the city of Columbia.[28] She grew to resent Elizabeth, and as she grew evermore unstable, she was unable to keep the secret of Elizabeth's parentage and threatened to undermine Comstock's rule over Columbia. Comstock murdered her and blamed Daisy Fitzroy and the Vox Populi for her death, using the act to further establish control over the city. Lady Comstock now exists in a spectral form, fuelled by her own rage and hatred. In this form, known as 'the Siren,' she has the ability to raise the dead to do her bidding. She attempts to kill Elizabeth several times until Elizabeth convinces her that they are both Comstock's victims.
