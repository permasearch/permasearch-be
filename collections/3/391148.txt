Phoebe commits herself to too many activities and Max helps her out by creating a clone so she can be at two places at once. However, like many of Max's activities, it doesn't work out very well. Clone Phoebe turns out to be really dumb. Phoebe and Max attempt to restrain the clone by selling brownies at Phoebe and Cherry's bake sale, but it escapes, leaving Phoebe tied and gagged under the table. Max eventually manages to stop the clone. Meanwhile, Nora and Billy must find a dance routine for their school talent show.
