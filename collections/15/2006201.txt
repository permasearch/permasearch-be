U.S. 287 originates at its southern terminus in Port Arthur, TX as a branch of State Highway 87. From Port Arthur, U.S. 287 is co-signed with U.S. 69 and U.S. 96 to Lumberton, where U.S. 96 diverges to the northeast and the co-signed U.S. 287/69 continues northwest until U.S. 287 and U.S. 69 diverge in Woodville. Continuing northwest, U.S. 287 merges with I-45 in Corsicana and follows the interstate to Ennis, where it branches off and continues through Waxahachie, crossing I-35E and continuing north through Tarrant County, where it encounters and briefly merges with three different interstates (I-820, I-20, and I-35W). From Fort Worth, U.S. 287 continues north to Wichita Falls and continues just south of the Oklahoma border before entering the Texas Panhandle. A Section of U.S. 287, between Midlothian and Waxahachie TX, was dedicated as the Chris Kyle Memorial HWY, in honor of fallen SEAL Chris Kyle, whose hometown was Midlothian.
