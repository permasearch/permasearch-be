Australia and Indonesia are both members of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area, signed in February 2009.[3] Both countries are currently negotiating an Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), intended to build upon existing agreements. The first round of discussions was held in Jakarta in September 2012.[74] Indonesia applies most favoured nation status to Australian imports, while Australia applies equivalent concessions through its developing country tariff rate.[75]
