Lozada's successor, Carlos Mesa, made a referendum about the gas into which the question Do you agree with President Carlos Mesa's policy of using gas as a strategic recourse to achieve a sovereign and viable route of access to the Pacific Ocean? was added. 54.79% of the votes said "yes" to this question. Mesa even took the question about a sea access to the OAS where he had a verbal intercourse with Chilean president Ricardo Lagos who said that it was a bilateral topic. Mesa resigned following the 2005 Hydrocarbons Law.
