NASA maintains a database for tracking PAHs in the universe.[269][309] More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs,[269][269] possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe,[291][292][293] and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.[269]
