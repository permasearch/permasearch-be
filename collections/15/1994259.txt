In 2000 WestJet expanded to Canada's eastern region, choosing Hamilton as the airline's eastern region hub,[7] and flying to destinations from Newfoundland and Labrador to British Columbia. Continental Airlines also offered service to Cleveland in 2000 but stopped in the same year. In April 2004, seeking to compete with Air Canada for business travellers, WestJet moved its eastern hub from Hamilton to Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga. While Hamilton retained flights to many destinations, all of the service between Hamilton and Montreal and Ottawa was moved to Toronto. In the wake of the WestJet pullout, CanJet began service to Hamilton in 2003. Then in the spring of 2005, two weeks after Air Canada Jazz announced it would enter the local market with service from Hamilton to Montreal and Ottawa, CanJet announced a complete withdrawal from Hamilton. Air Canada Jazz flights to Montreal and Ottawa stopped by 2008. From 2007 to 2009, flyglobespan offered seasonal service to Britain and Ireland, including Liverpool, Manchester and Doncaster. In 2010, WestJet cut two-third of the flights out of Hamilton. The only remaining service by WestJet was one daily service to Calgary.[7] In 2015, Air Canada Rouge planned to begin daily service to Calgary by June 2015 but the launch was delayed until 2016. There were no flights to Calgary by Air Canada Rouge as of November 2016. Canada Jetlines also announced plans to fly to Hamilton Airport. NewLeaf began service to several destinations in 2016. This was followed by Air Canada's announcement that it would resume daily flights to Montreal on May 24, 2016.
