Note that     a → ( b → c )   {\displaystyle a\rightarrow (b\rightarrow c)}   is logically equivalent to     ( a ∧ b ) → c   {\displaystyle (a\land b)\rightarrow c}  ; this property is sometimes called un/currying.  Because of these properties, it is convenient to adopt a right-associative notation for → where     a → b → c   {\displaystyle a\rightarrow b\rightarrow c}   denotes     a → ( b → c )   {\displaystyle a\rightarrow (b\rightarrow c)}  .
