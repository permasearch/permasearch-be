Under a microscope, the molecules making up a liquid are too small to be visible, but the jittery motion of pollen grains or dust particles can be seen. Known as Brownian motion, it results directly from collisions between the grains or particles and liquid molecules. As analyzed by Albert Einstein in 1907, this experimental evidence for kinetic theory is generally seen as having confirmed the concrete material existence of atoms and molecules.
