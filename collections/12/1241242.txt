Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used Instagram as a tool to “encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure”[46].  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the #DearNYFW campaign, which targeted the fashion industry’s harmful approach towards their bodies[51]. This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience,  in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start “prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway”[51]. In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer Tarik Carroll released a photo series titled the EveryMAN Project. The prject showcased large-framed queer and transgender men of color, with the purpose of “challenging hyper-masculinity and gender norms, while bringing body-positivity to the forefront”[52]. Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.
