The Daddy Long-legs Spider Pholcus phalangioides (so named because the abdomen is finger-shaped) is one of nine introduced pholcids in Australia. A myth developed around its venom, suggesting it would easily kill a person if only its fangs were big enough to penetrate skin. This suggestion is bogus.[19] It may have arisen because of its ability to kill the Redback Spider Latrodectus hasseltii. Daddy Long-legs Spiders can tangle up and wrap Redback Spiders from a safe distance by means of their long legs, which they use to apply silk. Once the Redback is fully trussed, the Daddy Long-legs Spider bite at will and simply wait for the bigger spider to die so it can feed.[3]
