Abraham Mendelssohn renounced the Jewish religion; he and his wife decided not to have Felix circumcised, in contravention of the Jewish tradition.[9] Felix and his siblings were first brought up without religious education, and were baptised by a Reformed Church minister in 1816,[10] at which time Felix was given the additional names Jakob Ludwig. Abraham and his wife Lea were baptised in 1822, and formally adopted the surname Mendelssohn Bartholdy (which they had used since 1812) for themselves and their children.[11] The name Bartholdy was added at the suggestion of Lea's brother, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, who had inherited a property of this name in Luisenstadt and adopted it as his own surname.[12] In an 1829 letter to Felix, Abraham explained that adopting the Bartholdy name was meant to demonstrate a decisive break with the traditions of his father Moses: "There can no more be a Christian Mendelssohn than there can be a Jewish Confucius". (Letter to Felix of 8 July 1829).[13] On embarking on his musical career, Felix did not entirely drop the name Mendelssohn as Abraham had requested, but in deference to his father signed his letters and had his visiting cards printed using the form 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy'.[14] In 1829, his sister Fanny wrote to him of "BartholdyÂ [...] this name that we all dislike".[15]
