Amber and Keith defeated Rodger and Tina, while Colby and Jerri beat Nick and Elisabeth. Even though they had trouble at the climbing wall and Colby dropped Jerri, they narrowly defeated Amber and Keith to win reward. Once they got off the helicopter and onto the boat, Colby told Jerri he did not want to talk about the game at all, but just to enjoy where they were. When they got back to Barramundi, Colby gave everyone their own piece of coral from the reef. It was revealed later to production staff that removing coral from the Great Barrier Reef is illegal, and a warning appeared stating such before the episode's original Australian broadcast on the Nine Network.
