Following the Cincinnati Reds second championship in 1940, the franchise only had one post-season appearance between 1941 and 1969.[5] During the 1970s, however, the Reds would appear in the post-season six times during the decade, along with four National League pennants, and back-to-back World Series championships in 1975 and 1976.[5][6]   The Reds were nicknamed Big Red Machine during the time period and complied, what some have claimed to be, the best teams in major league baseball history.[7]  Following the 1976 championship and Big Red Machine era, the Reds struggled to sustain consistent post-season appearances.
