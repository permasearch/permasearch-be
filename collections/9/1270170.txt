In the United Kingdom, the Home Office reported that identity fraud costs the UK economy Â£1.2 billion annually[69] (experts believe that the real figure could be much higher)[70] although privacy groups object to the validity of these numbers, arguing that they are being used by the government to push for introduction of national ID cards. Confusion over exactly what constitutes identity theft has led to claims that statistics may be exaggerated.[71] An extensively reported[72][73] study from Microsoft Research[74] in 2011 finds that estimates of identity theft losses contain enormous exaggerations, writing that surveys "are so compromised and biased that no faith whatever can be placed in their findings."
