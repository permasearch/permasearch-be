Elimination: The team initially agreed on Joanna and Julia, but when the nominations were being given to Ramsay, Jen admitted she should be nominated instead of Julia. Ramsay called the three women up. When asked, Julia said she should not be eliminated because of her lack of experience, something Ramsay agreed with. Ramsay then immediately sent Julia back in line and told the other two to justify why they should stay. Jen defended herself and admitted her mistake, but Joanna said nothing in her defense and instead said that Jen deserved to go home for considering serving spaghetti from the trash. However, Ramsay instead eliminated Joanna since she actually did serve the rotten crab and refused to accept responsibility for her mistake.[9]
