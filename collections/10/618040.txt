In 1997, coal accounted for more than 80% of primary energy consumption and hydro power more than 10%. Net imports of coal represented only about 3% of coal consumption. Hydroelectric power plants generated about 65% of North Korea's electricity and coal-fired thermal plants about 35% in 1997.[citation needed] However, with only 20% of the per capita electricity generation of Japan, the DPRK suffers from chronic supply shortages. Coal exports to China currently account for a major portion of the DPRK's revenue.[53]
