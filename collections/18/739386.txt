Most of Buffy was shot on location in Los Angeles, California. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually Torrance High School, in Torrance, California, the same high school used for Beverly Hills, 90210.[14] The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.[15] In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair. From Season Two more permanent sets were built, including the full interior of Buffy's house, Angel's mansion, Giles' apartment, and extensions to the high school set (the addition of a dining hall and commons area).[15] A driveway area near the gated entrance to Fox Studios was transformed into a graveyard.[15] In Season Three the Sunnydale "Main Street" was constructed on the backlot, which would be a staple location for the rest of the series.[16] When the show transitioned to college in the fourth season, the hallway sets from Sunnydale High were remodeled to appear as the interior hallways of UC Sunnydale.[17]
