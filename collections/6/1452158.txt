In 1956, the Federal-Aid Highway Act gave state and federal government complete control over new highways, and often they were routed directly through vibrant urban neighborhoods—isolating or destroying many—since the focus of the program was to bring traffic in and out of the central cores of cities as expeditiously as possible and nine out of every ten dollars spent came from the federal government. This resulted in a serious degradation of the tax bases of many cities, isolated entire neighborhoods,[20] and meant that existing commercial districts were bypassed by the majority of commuters.[21] Segregation continued to increase as communities were displaced and many African Americans and Latinos were forced to move into public housing while some whites moved to the suburbs.[22]
