In the Renaissance the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the Power of Women topos, with other biblical women who triumphed over men, such as Judith or Delilah.[10] Here she was used to show the risk for men in following women, in groupings including positive figures and scenes such as Judith beheading Holofernes, but mostly ones with female villains such as Phyllis riding Aristotle, Samson and Delilah, Salome and her mother Herodias an the Idolatry of Solomon. More positively, Jael was included in sets of the female Nine Worthies, such as the prints by Hans Burgkmair.[11] Ladies sometimes chose to have their portraits painted as Jael, a transformation achieved by holding a hammer and spike.[12]
