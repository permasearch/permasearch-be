Priyanka enters the stage citing a short poem (Shayari) Urdu Poetry –‘’Jo desh ka guroor ban jaye, andhere mein noor ban jaye, jiski kasmein khakar mar mite janta, wohi hota hai ek asli superstar.’’ It can be translated as- ‘’Anyone who aspires to be a superstar becomes a pride of the nation and a shining light in the darkness. S/he reaches a stage of respect when the common man starts worshipping him/her.’’ And then she performed a sizzling number ‘’Desi Girl’’ from her super hit movie Dostana.
