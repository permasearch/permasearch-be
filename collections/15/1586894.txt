In 1754 the Ohio Company started to build a fort at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River. A larger French force chased the Virginians away but encountered at the Battle of Jumonville Glen, which resulted in a French retreat.[135] After reports of the battle reached the French and British capitals, the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756; the North American component of this war is known as the French and Indian War.[136] At the 1754 Albany Congress, Pennsylvania colonist Benjamin Franklin proposed the Albany Plan of Union, which would have created a unified government of Thirteen Colonies to coordinate defense and other matters. The plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies and the colonists struggled to coordinate a military response to the French.[137] As the Thirteen Colonies failed to take charge of their own defense, the British dispatched General Edward Braddock to North America to oversee the war effort.[138] Braddock led an expedition into the Ohio country, suffering a rout at the Battle of the Monongahela.[139] British forces suffered further defeats in the following years, losing the Battle of Fort Oswego and the Siege of Fort William Henry.[140]
