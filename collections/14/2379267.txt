Rwanda and Uganda were allies during the First Congo War against Zaire, with both countries being instrumental in the setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war.[261] The two nations joined forces again at the beginning of the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war.[262] In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions,[262] and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani.[243] The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians.[263] Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more.[264]
