Linking the "public" sphere with justice and objective standards, for Han Fei, the private and public had always opposed each other.[96] Taking after Shang Yang he lists the Confucians among his "five vermin",[159] and calls the Confucian teaching on love and compassion for the people the "stupid teaching" and "muddle-headed chatter",[160] the emphasis on benevolence an "aristocratic and elitist ideal" demanding that "all ordinary people of the time be like Confucius' disciples".[52] Moreover, he dismisses it as impracticable, saying that "In their settled knowledge, the literati are removed from the affairs of the state... What can the ruler gain from their settled knowledge?",[161] and points out that "Confucianism" is not a unified body of thought.[162]
