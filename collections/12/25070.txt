The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice are both responsible for enforcing the FCPA. This is because the FCPA both amends an SEC Act and the criminal code. The SEC enforces the Act for companies it regulates and the Department of Justice enforces the bill regarding all other domestic companies. This split was criticized even before the act was passed.[8]:10â€“11 In 2010 the SEC created a specialized unit for FCPA enforcement.[17] In 2012, the SEC and the DOJ issued their first joint guide to the FCPA.[18]
