Several years before the present, when Takeru was ten years old, his family dojo was challenged by Tesshin Kushiya. His mother, Atsuma, was killed by Tesshin before his eyes. Takeru has resented his father and uncle for not being around to protect them.[ch. 7] As a result, he tends to take the girl's side whenever a girl fights a guy. His abilities originally manifest under extreme stress as in the case where he protected Azuki.[ch. 3] When he defended Kodama, he used Blood Pointer,[ch. 5] which was later described as absorbing Element from the people around him through his mouth.[ch. 23] Following the battle with the Venus unit, he underwent extra training with Minori in order to try to control and to increase his powers.[ch. 28–29] Takeru later learned that he is blood related to Kodama's brother.[ch. 53]
