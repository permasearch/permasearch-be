Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 outlines the orders which can issued by the court. A ‘contact order’ (now termed a Child Arrangements Order) outlines the requirements, of the person the child resides with, to allow contact with another person. A ‘prohibited steps order’ prevents a parent from exercising their full parental responsibility without consent of the court. A ‘residence order’ (now termed a Child Arrangements Order) puts in place the arrangements for whom a child should live with. A ‘specific issue order’ relates to directions given from the court to address a query that has arisen regarding parental responsibility for a child.[30] Section 8 orders cannot be made in regards to children who are looked after; with the exception of the residence order.[31] When an application is made to the court for a section 8 order the court takes into account: the nature of the proposed application; the connection the person has to the child; the disruption that could be caused to the child and, if the child is being looked after by the local authority: the local authorities plans for the child’s future and the wishes of the child’s parents.[32] A person who gains a residence order for a child will hold parental responsibility for the time the order is in place.[33] Despite this, the Act forbids anyone to change the child’s surname or remove them from the United Kingdom without permission from all those with parental responsibility or with express permission from the court.[34] Under section 63(3) of the [1980 c. 43.] Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 the court has powers to punish those who do not abide by the ruling set out in the residence order.[35]
