Ram (Girish Kumar) is a rich, city boy, born to billionaire parents and brought up in Australia. On the other hand, Sona (Shruti Haasan) is a traditional, simple desi girl from Punjab who is brought up by her only brother, Raghuveer (Sonu Sood). He is heartbroken when their father marries another woman and throws them out of the house, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies and her tomb is built on the small land which they own until the zamindar tells them that it is his land, since their mother had taken a loan from the man. Raghuveer volunteers to work day and night, to pay off the loan as long as they don't tear down his mother's tomb. The Zamindar agrees and the local station master helps them. Slowly Raghuveer and Sona grow up. One day, Riya, Sona's best friend, comes to their house to invite Sona to their house as she is getting married. Riya's cousin, Ram also arrives on the same day with his mother, Ashwini (Poonam Dhillon).
