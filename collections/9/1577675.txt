However, several other countries in Asia were also experiencing a growth in the popularity of Korean dramas and pop songs. In 2000 in the Indian state of Manipur, where Bollywood movies were banned by separatists, consumers gradually turned their attention to Korean entertainment.[37] According to Agence France-Presse, Korean phrases were commonly heard in the schoolyards and street markets of Manipur.[38] Many Korean dramas and films were smuggled into Manipur from neighbouring Burma, in the form of CDs and DVDs.[37] Popularity in Korean products subsequently spread to other parts of Northeast India including Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Mizoram and Nagaland.[39] In 2002, BoA's album Listen to My Heart became the first album by a Korean musician to sell a million copies in Japan.[40]
