The Dining Saloon was located mid-ship on F-Deck and was actually two rooms separated by a bulkhead. It was 100Â ft. long in total and could accommodate 473 at a time.[19] Like other parts of Third-Class, the Saloon was segregated: the forward room was reserved for families and single women and the after room for single men.[20] The uptake shafts from Boiler Rooms 2 and 3 partially occupied spaces in both rooms, dividing them into four different sections. There were some sections paneled in pine, but otherwise only steel painted in white enamel and hung with posters advertising other White Star ships. Nonetheless there were comfortable, freestanding wooden chairs and the room was brightly lit by portholes.
