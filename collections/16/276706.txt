Canadian explorer Joseph B. MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to Fitzgerald over a three-day period in 1994.[75] Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided Edwin A. Link as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, Celia.[73]  The GLSHS paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures.[76] MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why Fitzgerald sank.[77] The same year, longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd., and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of Fitzgerald, using Delta Oceanographic's submersible, Delta.[78] Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video[79] while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to Fitzgerald at 211 minutes.[80] Prior to conducting the dives, Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976.[81] Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition, "at least one-third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S.â€“Canada boundary line shown on official lake charts."[82]
