Kate Mulgrew later recalled that she "loved shooting every second of 'The 37's'"; she specifically praised the writing, Sharon Lawrence as Amelia Earhart, and director James L. Conway.[10] Tim Russ (Tuvok) praised the episode as a fine example of science fiction and said he wished to see more of this type of episode. Braga felt "The 37's" had a lot of fun and cool elements such as meeting Earhart and landing the ship, but that the episode fell flat after meeting the colonists and never seeing their cities on the planet.  Star Trek: Voyager co-creator Michael Piller described the premise of the episode as hokey, comparing it to "old Star Trek"; instead Piller praised the landing of the ship as "pretty amazing."[4]  Series co-creator Rick Berman described "The 37's" as "a great episode."[21]
