Barrier islands are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends. The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.[7]
