Like her predecessor, Ralphie V was donated to Colorado by Ted Turner.[20] She was born in October 2006 at the Vermejo Park Ranch in northern New Mexico and was named "Blackout."[20] She began training at the age of two months to prepare her to take the field. When she was introduced at the "Ralphie's Salute to a New Era" event she weighed in at 500  pounds (227 kg).[20] Ralphie V runs faster than Ralphie IV and still somewhat wild, according to handlers,[20] and will be larger than the past Ralphies.[20] Her debut game came against Eastern Washington on September, 6th 2008, Colorado won 31-24.
