Many colonists of the Thirteen Colonies had left England in part to gain a measure of religious freedom.[citation needed]  With the royal government's religious favoritism fresh in their memory, the Founders sought to prevent the return of the Test Acts by adding this clause to the Constitution. Specifically, Charles Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina where a Protestant denomination was the established state religion, introduced the clause to Article VI and it passed with little opposition.[2][3]
