During the last century, decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed. In 2007, German Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel cited estimates that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050.[151] Of these, about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction.[152] Estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year (based on Species-area theory).[153] This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices, because few species emerge each year.[citation needed] Almost all scientists acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates.[152] As of 2012, some studies suggest that 25% of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years.[154]
