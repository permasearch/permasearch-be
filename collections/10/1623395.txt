In January 2016, Boeing confirmed plans to reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X created by a lack of new orders.[118] In 2018, assembling test 777-9 aircraft is expected to lower output to an effective rate of 5.5 per month.[119] Boeing will drop 777 production to five per month in August 2017.[120]
