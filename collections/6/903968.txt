When I was young I used to wait On Massa and hand him de plate; Pass down de bottle when he get dry, And brush away de blue-tail fly.  Jim crack corn I don't care,  Jim crack corn I don't care,  Jim crack corn I don't care,  Ole Massa gone away.  Den arter dinner massa sleep, He bid dis niggar vigil keep; An' when he gwine to shut his eye, He tell me watch de blue-tail fly.  Jim crack corn, &c.  An' when he ride in de arternoon, I foller wid a hickory broom; De poney being berry shy, When bitten by de blue-tail fly.  Jim crack corn, &c.  One day he rode around de farm, De flies so numerous dey did swarm; One chance to bite him on the thigh De debble take dat blue-tail fly.  Jim crack corn, &c.  De poney run, he jump an' pitch, An tumble massa in de ditc' He died, an' de jury wonder'd why De verdic was de blue-tail fly  Jim crack corn, &c.  Dey laid 'im under a 'simmon tree, His epitaph am dar to see: 'Beneath dis stone I'm forced to lie, All by de means ob de blue-tail fly.'  Jim crack corn, &c.  Ole massa gone, now let 'im rest, Dey say all tings am for de best; I neber forget till de day I die, Ole massa an' dat blue-tail fly  Jim crack corn, &c.
