Luxu (ルシュ, Rushu) is a Keyblade Master and the mysterious hooded sixth apprentice of the Master of Masters who appears in Kingdom Hearts χ. Like the Foretellers, he is named after one of the seven deadly sins, lust (luxuria in Latin). He is the only one not given a tome from the Book Prophecies and thus the only one not building a Union. However, the Master of Masters has prepared him a special role after his disappearance: he is to receive the Master's Keyblade and pass it down to his apprentices so the Master can continue to see the future. He is also to sit on the sidelines and watch as the Keyblade War unfolds. Luxu's fate after the Keyblade War is unknown, but his master's keyblade eventually passes down to Xehanort.
