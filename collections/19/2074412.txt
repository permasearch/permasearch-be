The tenth hole is a very short, 315 yard Par-4 known as a risk-reward hole. Longer hitters can try to drive the green but an accurate drive will be needed since several bunkers surround the green. The 11th hole is a long Par-5 where eucalyptus trees and a barranca come into play. The 12th is a long Par-4, often into the wind, that plays to a narrow green surrounded by the barranca, bunkers and trees. One, Bogey's Tree, is named after Humphrey Bogart.
