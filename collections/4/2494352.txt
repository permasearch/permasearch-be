In July 2018, Avenged Sevenfold's Facebook account published a post written by Shadows stating that he was suffering from a severe vocal cord viral infection, which was temporarily effecting his ability to sing.  Avenged Sevenfold cancelled all tour/concert dates for the following three months to allow Shadows to recover.
