This distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by i or í in writing, or soft ones by y or ý (except in loanwords such as kilogram).[39] Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as "strong", and soft ones as "weak".[40]
