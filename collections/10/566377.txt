In "Single Ladies", BeyoncÃ© portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce.[6] The song was released simultaneously with "If I Were a Boy"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer.[7] This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs.[8] The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008;[9] "Single Ladies" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1.[10] Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008;[11] "Single Ladies" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day,[12] while "If I Were a Boy" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.[13] The two songs were released as a double A-side single on November 7, 2008, in Australia,[14] New Zealand,[15] and Germany.[16] Dance remixes of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009,[17] and in Europe on February 16, 2009.[18] "Single Ladies" was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the UK Singles Chart as a result of download sales.[19] On February 16, 2009, it was released as a CD single, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.[20][21]
