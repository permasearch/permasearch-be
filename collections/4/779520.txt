There is an additional embellishment to The Golden Legend, which according to Henry Ansgar Kelly, was added centuries later, and widely repeated.[28] On the evening before Valentine was to be executed, he is supposed to have written the first "valentine" card himself, addressed to the daughter of his jailer Asterius, who was no longer blind, signing as "Your Valentine."[28] The expression "From your Valentine" was later adopted by modern Valentine letters.[29] This legend has been published by both American Greetings and The History Channel.[30]
