Euthydemus I was, according to Polybius[5] a Magnesian Greek. His son, Demetrius, founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom, was therefore of Greek descent from his father at minimum. A marriage treaty was arranged for Demetrius with a daughter of Antiochus III the Great, who had partial Persian descent.[6] The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is less clear.[7]
