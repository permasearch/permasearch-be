Later, during a meeting between Gus, Juan Bolsa, and Hector, a furious Hector collapses. Gus performs CPR on Hector, saving his life. As Hector is taken away in an ambulance, Gus grows suspicious of Nacho, who had switched out Hector's heart medication to keep Hector from using Nacho's father's upholstery business as a front.
