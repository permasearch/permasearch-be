War is a state of organized, armed, and often prolonged conflict carried on between states, nations, or other parties[20][21] typified by extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality.[20] War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence.[22] Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century: the death toll of World War II, estimated at more than 60 million, surpasses all other war death tolls by a factor of two. It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.[23]
