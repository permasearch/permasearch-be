Teri and Kim are examined at a hospital and Dr. Rose Kent suspects that Teri's abdominal pain she started having is related to an ovarian cyst rupture. As the doctor begins explaining that an enlarged uterus can be the cause, Nina interrupts and says they must go to the safe house immediately. Dr. Kent gives Teri a pregnancy test to use on herself later. The two are then taken to a safe-house where Teri takes the pregnancy test and it turns out that she is pregnant. The safe house is later attacked by minions of the Drazens, and they are able to escape by car. The car rolls down a hill with Kim inside and explodes, leading Teri to believe that Kim had been killed and causing her to suffer amnesia. Teri is helped by the man she had been seeing while separated from Jack, and eventually is returned to CTU by Tony Almeida where she would be "safe" and he tells her that Kim had escaped from the car before it exploded and that she is alive. She later learns from Nina that Kim had been kidnapped again by Drazen's men while heading to CTU from the police station and that Jack is working on saving her. When Jack speaks to her on the phone, Teri tells him that she is pregnant. Jack starts crying and tells her that he's happy about it and that he loves her. When Jack and Kim are both safe and on their way back to CTU, Teri goes to speak with Nina and accidentally discovers that she is the mole for the Drazens. She attempts to leave, but Nina stops her at gunpoint.
