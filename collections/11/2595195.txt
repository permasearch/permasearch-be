Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can form in the skin, lymph nodes, or other organs.[3] The skin lesions are usually purple in color.[3] They can occur singularly, in a limited area, or be widespread.[5] It may worsen either gradually or quickly.[4] Lesions may be flat or raised.[4] Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) is found in the lesions of all those who are affected.[3] Risk factors include poor immune function, either as a result of disease or specific medications, and chronic lymphedema.[3][4]
