In May 1954, the Army's permit for starting construction on the Narrows Bridge lapsed.[51] The Army granted a two-year extension for the start of construction.[52] In a measure passed in March 1955, the city gained control over the approval process for several tasks related to the Narrows bridge's construction, including land acquisition.[53] A little more than a month later, New York Governor W. Averell Harriman signed a $600 million spending bill authorizing the construction of the Narrows Bridge; the construction of the Throgs Neck Bridge between Queens and the Bronx; and the addition of a second level to the George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey.[54] Later that year, it was announced that the Narrows Bridge would be part of an expansion to the Interstate Highway System.[55] Although a study on the viability of adding transit service to the Narrows Bridge was commissioned in early 1956,[56] Moses rejected the idea of adding subway tracks onto the new bridge, saying that it would be too costly.[57] In April of that year, New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner signed a bill that allowed the Port Authority to build the Narrows Bridge and lease it to the TBTA, who would operate the bridge.[58] The TBTA would buy the bridge from the Port Authority in 1967 as part of the agreement.[59]
