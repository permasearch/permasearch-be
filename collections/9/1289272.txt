Kanzai (カンザイ), code named the "Tiger",[ch. 319] is a hot-tempered bodyguard and Treasure Hunter.[ch. 346] He has a short temper as shown when he easily gets mad when Pariston and Hisoka tease him. When the Black Whale finally sets sail, Kanzai, Saccho and Saiyu stand guard over Beyond's cell. Kanzai comments that having three Zodiacs watching Netero is a waste of personnel, prompting a sneering remark from Saiyu and responding in kind.
