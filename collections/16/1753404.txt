The performance marked a change of scenery for TRL live performances, with the group singing in the studio instead of on a stage set up in Times Square, which was where the bulk of performers were situated in the first week. Billboard's Caitlin Kelley wrote positively about their vocal performance and synchronized harmonization, similarly, Mike Wass of Idolator felt that their vocals were "on point".[25][26] It also performed in February 2018 on Hollywood Boulevard to a small crowd of fans.[27]
