Later the detectives discover through advanced facial recognition that Teddy has a juvenile record and went under the name Teddy Voight, who five years prior was arrested for solicitation. Lindsay explains to Detective Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) that they knew Sgt. Voight before. SVU detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) go to a youth center where Teddy was remanded and learn that Teddy frequently ran away from the center. Security guard George Turner (Danny Mastrogiorgio) doesn't remember Teddy, but Miss Bagley (Donnetta Lavinia Grays) recommends that the detectives talk to Jocelyn Cerpaski (Isabel Shill), who left the center to start a better life. Jocelyn initially doesn't want to talk to the detectives, but she directs them to the piers where Teddy solicits. Rollins and Halstead find him and bring him in.
