Charity's secret lover was revealed to be Chris's sister, Zoe (Leah Bracknell), during a special hour-long episode.[13][17] Atkins explained the storyline was a shock to her as she had always thought Charity was "a man's woman."[13] However, the more she thought about it, the more she realised the story made sense. Atkins explained "Charity lives on the edge. She's certainly not gay, but she loves sex and it doesn't matter whether it's with a man or a woman."[13] Atkins said Charity likes to play games and she finds the idea of an affair with Chris's sister exciting.[13] The actress did not think the storyline was "sensationalist" and reckoned Charity is probably bisexual and was only just realising that through her relationship with Zoe.[13] Charity eventually ends the relationship with Zoe and goes on to marry Chris, despite admitting she does not love him and his money is the big attraction.[14] Atkins said Charity is honest, but she does have feelings for Chris, which would grow.[14] She added the lesbian affair had run its course, but she thought there might be repercussions from it in the future.[14]
