The Cardinals and Pirates also wore special uniforms, including features such as pullover jerseys with bright colors and contrasting sleeves, specially colored caps, and a unique logo that drew design cues from the official logos of both MLB and Little League Baseball. In addition, players were encouraged (though not required) to put nicknames on the jerseys' rear nameplates. These uniforms were worn again by both teams on August 25â€“27 for Players Weekend, an initiative of MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association that saw all 30 MLB teams wear similar uniforms.[13]
