Associated Press wrote that "Bond and Fleming were fun. They entertained, sometimes mildly, often grandly – but always consistently. Life will be less interesting without them."[17] In his review for The New York Times, Charles Poore wrote that The Man with the Golden Gun was "a gory, glittering saga".[26] Poore noted that "The Gee-whizzery ... starts early and never flags"[26] and that, despite the passing of Fleming, "the James Bond spirit soars on".[26] The critic for Books and Bookmen lamented the fact that "Bond has gone out like a lamb; even the girls are below par, while the villain seems like a refuge from a seedy Western. But we'll miss our James".[17]
