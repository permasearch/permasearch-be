On 6 January, Sheeran released two singles, "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill"; the theme of the latter single is about Sheeran's upbringing in his home town of Framlingham in Suffolk, with the castle referring to Framlingham Castle.[108] Following the release of these singles, Sheeran went on to co-host the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Scott Mills where it was inferred that he would possibly make an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2017.[109] It was also during this show that Sheeran used a new Martin guitar that featured the รท logo (of his new album) on both the headstock and body of the acoustic guitar.[110] Both singles went on to break the Spotify day one streaming record, with a combined total of over 13 million streams in 24 hours.[111]
