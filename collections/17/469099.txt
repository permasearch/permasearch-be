The long jump world record has been held by just four individuals for the majority of its existence. The first record ratified by the IAAF in 1901, by Peter O'Connor stood just short of 20 years. After it was broken in 1921, the record changed hands six times until Jesse Owens set the record at the 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in) that was not broken for 25 years and 2 months, until 1960 by Ralph Boston. Boston improved upon it and exchanged records with Igor Ter-Ovanesyan seven times over the next seven years. At the 1968 Summer Olympics Bob Beamon jumped 8.90 m (29 ft 2​1⁄4 in) at an altitude of 7,349 feet (2,240 m), a jump not exceeded for 23 years, and which remains the second longest legal jump of all time. On 30 August 1991 Mike Powell of the United States set the current men's world record at the World Championships in Tokyo. It was in a well-known show down against Carl Lewis, who also beat Beamon's record that day but with an aiding wind (thus not legal for record purposes). Powell's record 8.95 m (29 ft 4​1⁄4 in) has now stood for more than 26 years.
