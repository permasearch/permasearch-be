Christopher Tolkien gathered that originally his father imagined only two or three centuries between the first fall of Sauron and the War of the Ring, foreseeing no complicated events to have happened during this time.[91] With the progress of the narrative during 1941–2 to the breaking of the Fellowship and the war in Rohan, particular aspects in the history and culture of the South-kingdom were introduced one by one: alliance with the Rohirrim and ceding a province to them, in gratitude for their help in the first war with Sauron;[92] the White Tree and the winged crown, at first just as vague images in Aragorn's song;[93] the spelling Gondor;[94] and the Palantíri, with Hornburg and Isengard made into former Gondor fortresses and sites of two out of five Stones in the South-kingdom.[95] At a later point, the fifth palantír was imagined to have been at Erech, before being discarded overall.[90]
