Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium (phylum Apicomplexa). In humans, malaria is caused by P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi.[22][23] Among those infected, P. falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%).[5] Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,[24] recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.[25] P. vivax  proportionally is more common outside Africa.[26] There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes; however, except for P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques[23]—these are mostly of limited public health importance.[27]
