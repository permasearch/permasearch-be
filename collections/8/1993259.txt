Waffle House is called the "low-rent roadside cafe featuring waffles" in the 1996 romantic comedy movie Tin Cup.[26] It is also shown in the 2006 film ATL, and the movie Due Date, in which the main character selects that restaurant, despite being allergic to waffles. A Waffle House in Nashville was the setting for a routine by the stand-up comedian Bill Hicks.[27] The aforementioned 2017 ESPN story stated, "there's no business that has a more symbiotic relationship with college football fans of every stripe than the Waffle House."[13]
