A Serological pipette is designed for use as a blow-out pipette. A Serological pipette also has graduation marks, which start nearer the end of the tip. The pipette can be blown out by gravitational force or air pressure. Rubber bulbs attached to the end opposite the tip are commonly used to "blow out" any remaining solution. Having solution remain in the pipette can affect an experiment by allowing a discrepancy between what is measured and what is transferred. The designation of whether the pipette is "to deliver" (TD) or "to contain" (TC) is marked on most serological pipettes.[2]
