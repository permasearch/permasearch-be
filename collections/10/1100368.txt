Lactation proceeds for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years.[31] Like that of other whales, the sperm whale's milk has a higher fat content than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%,[163] compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese,[164] which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it.[165] It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg,[163] compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk.[166] Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.[31]
