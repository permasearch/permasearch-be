During a launch of a heavy communications satellite on 4 March 2016, SpaceX did an experimental descent and landing attempt with very low propellant margins. For the first time, and in order to reduce the propellant required, SpaceX attempted the landing burn with three engines. SpaceX had indicated that the test was unlikely to result in a successful landing and recovery. In the event, one engine flamed out early, and the rocket hit the deck surface with considerable velocity, destroying the rocket and causing damage to the drone ship's deck.[46] By March 21, 2016, the deck of the drone ship was nearly repaired.[47]
