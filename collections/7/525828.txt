Meanwhile, in Manhattan, Broadway, from 34th to 47th streets, was transformed into Super Bowl Boulevard from January 29 to February 1, allowing the public to participate in various NFL-related activities.[55] The boulevard was to contain activities such as autographs, a 60-foot (18Â m)-high toboggan run, and photographs with the Vince Lombardi Trophy.[56][57][58] As the area was expected to see around 400,000 people, security was increased in the area.[59]
