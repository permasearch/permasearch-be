The UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award (previously known as the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award) is an association football award given to the footballer playing for a football club in Europe that is considered the best in the previous season. The award, created in 2011 by UEFA, is aimed at reviving the European Footballer of the Year Award (Ballon d'Or),[1][2] which was merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year Award in 2010 to become the FIFA Ballon d'Or.[3] It also replaced the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award.[4]
