The show was the subject of an ownership battle between Roy Huggins and Warner Bros., which was the proximate cause of Huggins' departure from the studio.  The series was based on novels and short stories written by Huggins prior to his arrival at Warner, but as a matter of legal record, derived from a brief Caribbean theatrical release of its pilot, Girl on the Run, which was also given a theatrical release in the UK on the ABC circuit in 1959 and the supporting film to Warner Bros. The Old Man and the Sea starring Spencer Tracy.
