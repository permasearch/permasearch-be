The two find that the spirit that now lives in their body cannot be removed without their own death, requires blood to continue working on their bodies, and cannot abide bright lights. They recapture the witches, demanding to know what Amel has done to them, and are horrified to find that there is no higher purpose and this has not been known to happen before. They make a vampire of their chief steward Khayman, to test whether the spirit can be transferred between people, and to reduce the demands of the spirit by sharing it among others, and the embittered Khayman transfers vampirism to the sisters, to support him in fighting them. Mekare is lost overseas, after being captured by the queen, and no trace of her is found for around 6000 years; it is believed she may have lost her mind or become catatonic due to isolation and suffering. The other sister, Maharet, returns to her village after some years in the guise of a distant family member, and continues to return periodically over 6000 years, supporting and documenting the family over that entire period of time. Khayman seeks revenge and creates many vampires, causing Akasha and Enkil to be captured and held prisoner in rock, where after thousands of years of captivity they remain immobile as statues, until awakened accidentally by Lestat in modern times.
