Fiji was a British colony during World War II. The Fiji Defence Force served with New Zealand Army formations, under the Allied Pacific Ocean Areas command. The Fiji Infantry Regiment fought in the Solomon Islands Campaign against the Japanese. Fiji also constructed many facilities such as airfields for Allied bombing runs, barracks and training grounds[31].
