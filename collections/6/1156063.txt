In 2001, it was alleged that Huawei Technologies India had developed telecommunications equipment for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and newspapers reported that the Indian government had launched a probe into the firm's operations.[222][223] Huawei responded, stating that the company did not have "any link with the Taliban", as its only customers are telecommunications carriers[224] and its facilities "always operate according to U.N. rules and the local laws of each country".[225] On 15 December 2001, the Indian authorities announced that they had not found any evidence that Huawei India had any connection to the Taliban,[226] although the U.S. remains suspicious.[227]
