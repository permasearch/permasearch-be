The Guardian of Secrets (voiced by Janie Haddad-Tompkins) is a giant being who resembles Margaret and the protector of Margaret's secrets who appears in "Diary". Rigby unleashes her after foolishly looking at Margaret's secrets while repairing Margaret's diary, and she attempts to destroy Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips for looking at Margaret's secrets. This forces the trio to each reveal a secret of their own to defeat her.
