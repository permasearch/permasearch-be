"The Heart Wants What It Wants" is a midtempo pop and R&B song,[9][10] that contains a minimal electropop beat complete with finger snaps, ominous synths and haunting groans.[11] Several critics noted the reminiscence of the song to the works by singers Lorde and Lana Del Rey.[11][12] Lyrically, Gomez details being in love with a bad boy despite knowing he may not be a stand-up guy.[11] She sings, "The bed's getting cold and you're not here / The future that we hold is so unclear / But I'm not alive until you call / And I'll bet the odds against it all... / There's a million reasons why I should give you up / But the heart wants what it wants."[11]
