Reduced Level in surveying refers to equating elevations of survey points with reference to a common assumed datum. It is a vertical distance between survey point and adopted datum plane.[1] Thus it is considered as the base elevation which is used as reference to reckon heights or depths of other important places.[2] Reduced here means equating and Level means Elevations. Datum may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of straight zero.[3]
