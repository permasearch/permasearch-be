Fox or Foxe or Foxx is a surname originating in England and Ireland. The derivation is from the Middle English "fox", itself coming from the Old English pre 7th century "fox". The surname first appears on record in the latter part of the 13th century, with the first recorded spelling in 1273 to be that of John Fox in the "Hundred Rolls of Yorkshire", England.[2] In Ireland, Fox is mainly an Anglicised form of the Old Gaelic "Mac a'tSionnaigh" (son of the Fox).[2]
