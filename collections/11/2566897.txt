A few scholars have drawn from the work of Eric Stanley[22][23] by exploring the term ides as "lady" when discussing Grendel's mother, such as Temple ("Grendel's Lady-Mother," 1986)[24] and Taylor[25] (who argues in his 1994 essay that the term Ides indicates that "Grendel's mother is a woman of inherently noble status.")[26] In addition, others have suggested that Grendel's mother may be associated with the Norse figures of the valkyries and of the goddess Gefion who may be an extension of Frigg and Freyja. Freyja, the daughter of the sea god Njörðr, was both a fertility goddess and a goddess of war, battle, death, seiðr, prophecy and was also sometimes associated with the valkyries and disir.
