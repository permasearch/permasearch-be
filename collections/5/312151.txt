After vacationing for six days following the completion of the ...Baby One More Time Tour in September 1999, Spears returned to New York City to begin recording songs for her next album; the majority of the recording took place in November. It featured contributions from Max Martin, Eric Foster White, Diane Warren, Robert Lange, Steve Lunt, and Babyface.[12] The songs "Oops!... I Did It Again", "Walk On By", "What U See (Is What U Get)", and "Don't Go Knockin' On My Door" were the first to be recorded at Martin's Cheiron Studios in the first week of November; followed by "Stronger" and "Lucky", which were finalized (along with the title track) in January 2000. Spears recorded "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" at Robert Lange's villa in Switzerland in December 1999; Lange produced the song.[13] "Where Are You Now" was recorded at Cheiron Studios in November and finished at Battery Studios in New York City in January. "Girl in the Mirror" and "Can't Make You Love Me"'s instrumental track and melody were recorded in the fall of 1999 in Sweden, with Spears recording the vocals in mid-January at Parc Studios in Orlando, Florida.[14][15] Spears returned to New York, linking up with producer Steve Lunt to record Diane Warren's "When Your Eyes Say It" at Battery Studios on Friday, January 28, 2000, which preceded her TRL appearance that day. "One Kiss from You" was also recorded at Battery Studios but was later finished at 3rd Floor in New York City. Spears also recorded the last track for the album "Dear Diary" which would later be completed at East Bay Recording in Tarrytown, New York and at Avatar Studios in New York City.
