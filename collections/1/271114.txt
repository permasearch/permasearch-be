On his deathbed Charles asked his brother, James, to look after his mistresses: "be well to Portsmouth, and let not poor Nelly starve".[71] He told his courtiers, "I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying",[72] and expressed regret at his treatment of his wife. On the last evening of his life he was received into the Catholic Church, though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear.[73] He was buried in Westminster Abbey "without any manner of pomp"[72] on 14 February.[74]
