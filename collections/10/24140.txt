On 18 June 2010 in the Australian High Court, Hogan lost a long-running legal battle to keep the contents of his tax documents secret, paving the way for details of his offshore accounts to be published. Earlier the same year, Australian media reported that the Australian Crime Commission was in the final stages of preparing to lay criminal charges of tax evasion against Hogan, film producer John Cornell and their accountant Anthony Stewart, who it suspected channeled millions of dollars from the proceeds of the film Crocodile Dundee and other films into offshore tax havens. The release of the documents is expected to help finalize the Tax Office's case.[26]
