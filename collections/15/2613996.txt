Because the ballot marking is more complex, there can be an increase in spoiled ballots. In Australia, voters are required to write a number beside every candidate, and error rates can be five times higher than plurality voting elections[86] Since Australia has compulsory voting, however, it is difficult to tell how many ballots are deliberately spoiled.[87] Where complete rankings are not required, a ballot may become exhausted if none of the ranked choices on that ballot advance to the next round.
