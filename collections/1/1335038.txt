To prepare for the role, Taylor "looked into a bunch of child stars" and determined "that the main source of [their] damage comes from feeling that theyâ€™re loved for what they do and not who they are. The maternal/paternal or familial love or any kind of love is dependent on them being successful, making money, being sparkly, being famous, whatever the thing is." On the multiple alias Trish wields in the series, Taylor said, "Trish has a number of them. I think there is a part of her that is alpha that actually, if she had the kind of abilities that Jessica had, she would probably be President of the United States in that world or the equivalent. She would take it as far as she could because she has that in her."[22]
