Though officially credited solely to Osbourne, "Bark at the Moon" was co-written with guitarist Jake E. Lee and bassist/lyricist Bob Daisley. Lee claims he was threatened with firing by Osbourne's wife and manager Sharon if he refused to sign a 1983 contract stating that he would relinquish his claims to writing and publishing.[1] In 2003, Daisley filed a lawsuit against the Osbournes, claiming lost royalties for his significant songwriting contributions.
