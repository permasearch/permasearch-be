The ahara appears to have been the largest geographical subdivision of the Satavahana polity. Several inscriptions refer to aharas named after the governors appointed to rule them (e.g. Govardhanahara, Mamalahara, Satavanihara and Kapurahara).[48] This suggests that the Satavahanas attempted to build a formal administrative and revenue collection structure.[53]
