Slightly unusually, in the British Virgin Islands the formation of a company does not involve the issuing of subscriber shares.  Accordingly, when a company is incorporated it initially has no members.  The registered agent has a statutory power to appoint the first directors of the company, and the first directors can then receive subscriptions and issue shares.  However, until the first shares are issued the directors are personally liable for anything which they do in the name of the company.
