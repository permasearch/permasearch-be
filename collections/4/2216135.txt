Edge cities emerge from originally small towns and cities that grow and expand to create the size of its current state. Typically, these small towns and cities were suburbs. Many terms are used to refer to edge cities, such as: suburban business districts, major diversified centers, suburban cores, minicities, suburban activity centers, cities of realms, galactic cities, urban subcenters, pepperoni-pizza cities, superburbia, technoburbs, nucleations, disurbs, service cities, perimeter cities, peripheral centers, urban villages, and suburban downtowns.[17] Depending on the purpose and intent of the edge city, they may be built to serve that particular function. They may even serve to be extensions of larger metropolitan cities such as the relationship between Century City and Los Angeles.
