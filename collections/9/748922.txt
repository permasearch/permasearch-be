Beatrice “Bea” Benaderet (April 4, 1906 – October 13, 1968) was an American radio and television actress, comedienne, and voice artist. Born in New York City and raised in San Francisco, she began performing in Bay Area theatre and radio before embarking on a Hollywood career that spanned over three decades. Benaderet first specialized in voiceover work in the golden age of radio, appearing on numerous programs while working with noted comedians of the era such as Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, and Lucille Ball, and her expertise in dialect and characterization led to her becoming Warner Bros.' leading voice of female characters in their animated cartoons of the early 1940s through the mid-1950s.
