The legislature of the Louisiana Territory amended the militia law in 1810 to provide for an Inspector General of the Militia with an annual salary of $250. At the same time the legislature did away with the salary of the post of brigade inspector and reduced the number of times that the militia would drill each year to six. The legislature also repealed the requirement for officers to meet on the Monday for training before a muster.[23]
