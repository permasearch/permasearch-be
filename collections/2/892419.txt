Taylor was born to Doug and Liz Taylor on 13 August 1960 in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. He left school at the age of 16[10] and after holding a few jobs including as a sheet metal worker,[11] he would spend most of his early working days making ceramic toilet roll handles, for which he earned Â£52 a week.[12][13] Although he liked to play darts as a child, he never took up the game seriously until 1986 when he moved into a terraced house in Burslem, living near to Eric Bristow's pub the Crafty Cockney.
