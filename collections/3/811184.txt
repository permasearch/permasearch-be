When coal is used for electricity generation, it is usually pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler.[40] The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity.[41] The thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time; some older coal-fired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of 25%[42] whereas the newest supercritical and "ultra-supercritical" steam cycle turbines, operating at temperatures over 600 °C and pressures over 27 MPa (over 3900 psi), can achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45% (LHV basis) using anthracite fuel,[43][44] or around 43% (LHV basis) even when using lower-grade lignite fuel.[45] Further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre-drying (especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass) and cooling technologies.[46]
