Empirical research that analyzes vast databases from communication flows in social media finds that today's digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication.[10] For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90Â % of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.[10] This shows that the two-step model does not seem to be dead, nor obsolete, but simply one of several ways communication flows in modern networks.
