Pooja's condition is getting worse. The doctor informs them that Pooja has to be shifted to a hospital called Maurya. Rasikbhai and Sudhaben are shocked and say that Maurya is a private hospital and they would not have that much money to get Pooja admitted there. My observation was that even the existing hospital looked like a private one. What do you guys think? The cost of getting Pooja admitted to that hospital is Rs. 2,50,000 or US$ 5000 approx. Quite some money for Rasikbhai and Sudhaben. In the next frame, Maya Gujral has been shown playing cards and betting money as high as Rs. 4,00,000. What an irony. At one place, there is no money to save someone's life and at other, there is so much that they can be used for fun. Sudhaben tells Rasikbhai to go to Jayshree Bua for help. Rasikbhai is not really willing but he has got little options otherwise. Sudhaben asks Akash to join him - Akash readily agrees and says he will take care of Rasikbhai and tells Sudhaben not to worry and hopefully things will be done. I would have liked here, if Sudhaben would have been showed tired and tensed here - via makeup or apperance. Rasikbhai looked tired though.
