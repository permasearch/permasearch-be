Spider's gang continues to pressure Thao, assaulting him on his way home from work. After he sees Thao's injuries, Walt visits the gang's house, where he attacks a gang member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang performs a drive-by shooting on the Vang Lor home, injuring Thao. They also beat up Sue, and Walt is upset by this. Father Janovich tells him that the gang raped her and she is safe at the hospital. There are no other witnesses; the community members, including the victims, refuse to assist the police to incriminate the gang members.
