Market failure is a term used by economists to describe the condition where the allocation of goods and services by a market is not efficient. Keynesian economist[38] Paul Krugman views this scenario in which individuals' pursuit of self-interest leads to bad results for society as a whole.[39] John Maynard Keynes preferred economic intervention by government to free markets.[40] Some believe that the lack of perfect information and perfect competition in a free market is grounds for government intervention. Others perceive certain unique problems with a free market including: monopolies, monopsonies, insider trading and price gouging.[41]
