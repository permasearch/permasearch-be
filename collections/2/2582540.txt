The temperature dependencies of these two scattering mechanism in semiconductors can be determined by combining formulas for τ, Σ and      ⟨ v ⟩    {\displaystyle \left\langle v\right\rangle }  , to be for scattering from acoustic phonons       μ   p h   ∼  T  − 3  /  2     {\displaystyle {\mu }_{ph}\sim T^{-3/2}}   and from charged defects       μ   d e f   ∼  T  3  /  2     {\displaystyle {\mu }_{def}\sim T^{3/2}}  .[10][12]
