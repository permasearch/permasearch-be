Note: For melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, nonnodal regional metastasis, such as satellites and in-transit metastases, may be included in the N categorization (see the melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma chapters for specifics). For colorectal carcinoma, mesenteric tumor deposits without remaining nodal architecture are included in the N category.
