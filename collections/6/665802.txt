Within the European Union (EU), hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers.[65] In the United Kingdom, where 80% of Europe's hedge funds are based,[203] hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).[178] Each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities, including controls on use of derivatives in Portugal, and limits on leverage in France.[65]
