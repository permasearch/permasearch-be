Sodomy was not a clearly defined act in the early modern period. Jonathan Goldberg asserts that sodomy was "invisible so long as homosexual acts failed to connect with the much more visible signs of social disruption represented by unorthodox religious or social positions."[11] David Stymeist reconciles two opposing critical approaches to Edward II--one that views the play as subversive towards sexual norms and one that upholds sexual norms--by paying attention to how the play presents alternative sexuality and how it punishes sexual transgressions.[12]
