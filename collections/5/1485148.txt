The Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 secured the integrity of the Hapsburg inheritance by allowing a female successor, a principle approved by the various Hapsburg territories, the Imperial Diet, Spain, Russia, Prussia, Britain and France.[2] However, when his own daughter Maria Theresa was born in 1717, Charles had disinherited his two nieces Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, married respectively to the rulers of Bavaria and Saxony who now refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet. In addition, despite publicly agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735, France then signed a secret treaty with Bavaria in 1738 promising to back the 'just claims' of Charles Albert of Bavaria.[3]
