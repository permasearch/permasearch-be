Nearly all well-known algebraic structures other than Boolean algebras are undecidable. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student Wanda SzmielewÂ (1955) proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:
