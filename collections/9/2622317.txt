On Day 52 Jen, who was named as a replacement nominee for Amber, packed and scattered her belongings through the House, destroyed and bleached Dick's cigarettes. Dick, in retaliation, later threw Jen's clothing over the surrounding walls of the Big Brother house.[234] Big Brother later informed Dick they would replace the cigarettes. Jen began to cook food while on a slop restriction[234] Later that night, Jen went outside and ate food while on slop.[235] Big Brother told Jen she would receive a penalty nomination, she must be a nominee for the entire week and cannot win HoH or Veto for Week 8 if she survived Week 7.[236] This was found unfair to Jameka, the other Week 7 nominee, and the penalty nomination was removed.[237] Jen would instead receive a penalty eviction vote for Week 7 plus any votes cast against her by her fellow HouseGuests.[235]
