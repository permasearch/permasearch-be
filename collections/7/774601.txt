Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis,[1][2] who was an employee of the Cetus Corporation, and also the winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, it is an easy, cheap, and reliable way to repeatedly replicate a focused segment of DNA, a concept which is applicable to numerous fields in modern biology and related sciences.[3] PCR is probably the most widely used technique in molecular biology. This technique is used in biomedical research, criminal forensics, and molecular archaeology.[4]
