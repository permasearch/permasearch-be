The above question about national anthems that have been parodied led me to mention "Why was s/he born so beautiful, why was s/he born at all". I put it into an Australian context, because I have always assumed it's an Australian song. I've only ever heard it at Australian birthday parties â€“ if only because I've never attended a birthday party while overseas. It even borrows the tune of what later became our national anthem, Advance Australia Fair. But I was surprised to see no mention of it in that article or even the talk page, so I thought I'd do a bit of digging and find when and where it originated.
