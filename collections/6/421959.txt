Public misgivings were increased when, on 28 October 1987, a glitzy television program titled Return to the Titanic Live was broadcast from the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris with Telly Savalas hosting.[118] In front of a live TV audience, a valise recovered from the sea bed was opened, revealing a number of personal items apparently belonging to Richard L. Beckwith of New York, who survived the sinking. A safe was also opened, revealing a few items of memorabilia and some soggy banknotes. The tone of the event has been described by one commentator as "unsympathetic, lack[ing] dignity and finesse, and [with] all the superficial qualities of a 'media event'."[41] The TV critic of The New York Times, John Corry, called the event "a combination of the sacred and profane and sometimes the downright silly."[119] Paul Heyer comments that it was "presented as a kind of deep sea striptease" and that Savalas "seemed haggard, missed several cues and at one point almost tripped over a chair". Controversy persisted after the broadcast when claims were made that the safe had been opened beforehand and that the show had effectively been a fraud.[120]
