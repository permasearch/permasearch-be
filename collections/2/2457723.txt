The first goal between the two sides was scored by England's William Kenyon-Slaney[21] in the next game at The Oval, the first official match between the two in England, which the English won 4–2 on 8 March 1873.[18] Following this, the game became an annual event, being held in England or Scotland in alternate years.[18] Scotland took their first win in the fixture in the 1874 game, again played at Hamilton Crescent, where they defeated England 2–1.[22] Later in the 1870s Scotland won the fixture three times in a row, including a 7–2 victory in the 1878 game.[18]
