Of course the importance of print culture to education is not simply about counting publication figures.  Students had to use the books that were given to them and they had to use pen and paper to organise and make sense of the information that they were learning.[22]   In this sense print culture was closely tied to manuscript culture, particularly the skills and routines associated with note-taking.  Perhaps one of the most notable accomplishments of Enlightenment educational systems is that they taught students how to efficiently manage information on paper, both in school and then in university.[23]
