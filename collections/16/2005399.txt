For the 2015-2016 season, Vail undertook another massive construction project on the Front Side. Doppelmayr built a second high speed six pack, the Avanti Express (#2) lift, replacing the original high speed quad and increasing uphill capacity from 2,800 pph to 3,600 pph. Just like the Mountaintop Express lift built two years before it, the Avanti Express lift was built with a loading carpet. The fun park at Eagle's Nest was also expanded with the addition of a new zipline canopy tour in Game Creek Bowl, and the construction of an alpine coaster to the west of the Pride Express lift.
