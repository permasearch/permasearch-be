Part 3: For the fourth game, Spider-Man teams up with Iron Spider, Agent Venom, and Thor against Terrax, Attuma, and Annihilus in a fight within the subway. Sneaking away from the battle, Spider-Man obtains some Life Model Decoys and uses them to distract Grandmaster so he, Iron Spider, and Agent Venom can board Grandmaster's ship to save the civilian hostages. While Collector summons A-Bomb, Hawkeye, and She-Hulk to the battle, Spider-Man, Iron Spider, and Agent Venom gain the unlikely assistance of an imprisoned Leader and MODOK to give them powers to be invincible
