The live show opened with a catwalk performance from the fifteen models to Rudimental's song "Feel the Love", and the judges were asked their opinions of the final three. The final shoot for the cover and spread in Harper's Bazaar was shown, and the judges interviewed their favorite girls on their thoughts about their careers and modelling. After a second runway performance, the show highlighted each girls' journey throughout the competition, before going over interviews with their friends and family. Immediately afterwards, the third-placing finalist was announced. The models then perform in a rendition of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" with Cirque du Soleil, and Melissa was revealed to be the eighth winner of Australia's Next Top Model.
