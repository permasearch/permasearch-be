December 2011 saw the announcement of the possible comeback of Thierry Henry, Arsenal's all-time best player and goalscorer, to whom a statue was built, to the club, and the following month, it was confirmed that he had rejoined the Gunners from the New York Red Bulls on a two-month loan deal coinciding with the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season. On 9 January 2012, Henry marked his return to Arsenal with his second debut at the Emirates against Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup. Furthermore, he scored the winning goal – his 227th overall for Arsenal – after coming on as a substitute and collecting a long through from Alex Song. It was a moment that sent Arsenal fans into raptures, and Henry gave them even more to cheer about when he produced another winner to give Arsenal a 2–1 victory in a Premier League match against Sunderland. However, the Gunners suffered a shocking 4–0 loss to Milan in the Champions League in what would eventually be Henry's final match with the club, creating what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the club to overturn. Arsenal were also eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round, again against Sunderland, losing 2–0.
