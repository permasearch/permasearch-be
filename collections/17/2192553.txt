The CFNI moral code can be found in the student handbook. Students are required to adhere to standards based on the school's Pentecostal, charismatic and evangelical roots which include not participating in what are termed "immoral behaviors" including sex outside of marriage, vulgar language, and same-sex relationships.[citation needed]
