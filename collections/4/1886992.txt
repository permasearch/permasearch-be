In a given year, approximately two percent of American adults and European adults experience GAD.[8][9] Globally about 4% are affected at some point in their life.[1] GAD is seen in women twice as much as men.[10] GAD is also common in individuals with a history of substance abuse and a family history of the disorder.[11] Once GAD develops, it may become chronic, but can be managed or eliminated with proper treatment.[12]
