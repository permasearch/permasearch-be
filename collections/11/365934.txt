In the United States, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a Bachelor of Arts degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical B.F.A. program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general liberal arts studies. For a B.A. in Art, the ratio might be reversed.
