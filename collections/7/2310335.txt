Sleekwhisker is noted to be one of Darktail's most loyal followers after he takes over ShadowClan and merge the remaining ShadowClan cats and his rogues and form what he has called the Kin. She supports every decision he has made and is deeply suspicious of Violetpaw. She begins to become suspicious of Needletail as well, after Rain had died in the claws of Darktail for betraying him. When Dawnpelt realizes that it was a mistake to stay with the Kin, she tells Violetpaw that she is going to leave and already has sent Juniperclaw and Strikestone to seek for ThunderClan. Dawnpelt tells Violetpaw that Sleekwhisker would never want to leave the Kin and hasn't even asked her about leaving. When Dawnpelt mysteriously disappears, Sleekwhisker shows no emotions about her mother's absence and doesn't seem to care about it either, unlike her brothers who show extreme concern over their missing mother.
