India has a number of think tanks.[49] Most are based in New Delhi, and a few are government sponsored. A number of these work on foreign policy and security issues[citation needed]. There are few think tanks like Observer Research Foundation, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) and Centre for Civil Society who promote liberal social and economic ideas and others like the Rakshak Foundation, who encourage students to do empirical research and gain first hand experience in public policy issues[citation needed].
