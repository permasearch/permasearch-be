After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver),[82] the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 Rifle.[29][30][33][76] "(The M16) was much lighter compared to the M14 it replaced, ultimately allowing Soldiers to carry more ammunition. The air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle was made of steel, aluminum alloy and composite plastics, truly cutting-edge for the time. Designed with full and semi-automatic capabilities, the weapon initially did not respond well to wet and dirty conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat. After a few minor modifications, the weapon gained in popularity among troops on the battlefield."[76][84][85]
