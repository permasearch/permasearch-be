The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world.[177] IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.[177]
