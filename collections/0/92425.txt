The roadrunners (genus Geococcyx), also known as chaparral birds or chaparral cocks, are two species of fast-running ground cuckoos with long tails and crests. They are found in the southwestern United States and Mexico,[1][2] usually in the desert. Some have been clocked at 20 miles per hour (32Â km/h).
