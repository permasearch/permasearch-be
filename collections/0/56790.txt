Located within the thylakoid membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane, ATP synthase consists of two regions FO and F1. FO causes rotation of F1 and is made of c-ring and subunits a, b, d, F6. F1 is made of     α , β , γ , δ   {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta }   subunits. F1 has a water soluble par that can hydrolyze ATP. FO on the other hand has mainly hydrophobic regions. FO F1 creates a pathway for protons movement across the membrane.[7]
