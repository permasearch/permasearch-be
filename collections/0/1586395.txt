A notion of logical implication is defined for functional dependencies in the following way: a set of functional dependencies     Σ   {\displaystyle \Sigma }   logically implies another set of dependencies     Γ   {\displaystyle \Gamma }  , if any relation R satisfying all dependencies from     Σ   {\displaystyle \Sigma }   also satisfies all dependencies from     Γ   {\displaystyle \Gamma }  ; this is usually written     Σ ⊨ Γ   {\displaystyle \Sigma \models \Gamma }  . The notion of logical implication for functional dependencies admits a sound and complete finite axiomatization, known as Armstrong's axioms.
