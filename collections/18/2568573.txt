Coincident indicators change at approximately the same time as the whole economy, thereby providing information about the current state of the economy.  There are many coincident economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product, industrial production, personal income and retail sales. A coincident index may be used to identify, after the fact, the dates of peaks and troughs in the business cycle.[2]
