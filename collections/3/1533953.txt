The collider has four crossing points, around which are positioned seven detectors, each designed for certain kinds of research. The LHC primarily collides proton beams, but it can also use beams of heavy ions. Proton–lead collisions were performed for short periods in 2013 and 2016, lead–lead collisions took place in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015, and a short run of xenon–xenon collisions took place in 2017.[11]
