In 1963 Van Dyke was cast on an episode of GE True, hosted by Jack Webb.[8] When The Judy Garland Show was unsuccessfully revamped, Van Dyke left the program.[9] He turned down the offer to play Gilligan on Gilligan's Island, a role which instead went to Bob Denver.[8] He rejected as well an offer to replace Don Knotts as Sheriff Andy Taylor's deputy on The Andy Griffith Show.[8] Van Dyke finally accepted the lead role of attorney David Crabtree in My Mother the Car (1965), the misadventures of a man whose deceased mother Gladys (voiced by Ann Sothern) is reincarnated as a restored antique car.[5] Though the series was a commercial failure, Van Dyke continued to work steadily in supporting television and film roles through the rest of the decade.[5] He starred in another short-lived situation comedy Accidental Family (1967) as widowed comedian Jerry Webster who buys a farm to raise his son while he is not away on professional tours.[7]
