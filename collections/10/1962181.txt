New modes are also introduced to the game. The "Be a GM" mode, which had the player become the general manager of any NHL team they choose, is expanded into the "Franchise Mode". Team owners are introduced to the mode and players must now meet the team owner's expectations. The player can also potentially relocate their team to different city. If they relocate a team, they are free to build their own stadium and rebuild the team's image from the ground-up, similar to the team builder in EASHL.[10][11][12] For the second time in the NHL series, the World Cup of Hockey is playable;[12] NHL 2005 was the first NHL title to feature it.[13] Players may play through the tournament with any team from the World Cup they choose. The actual players, jerseys and logos for each team all appear in-game.[12] The "Draft Champions" mode is introduced to the series after a similar mode was featured in the Madden NFL series prior. A fantasy draft simulation, players are able to select NHL superstars in a 12-round draft and create their own team with them. After drafting, the player is then able to enter a tournament against the computer or other players online.[14] The player also has a chance of reaching the Draft Championship during the tournament.[12] Also added to NHL 17 is the ECHL, a North American hockey league. All 27 teams in the league are playable, with all team jerseys, logos and players appearing.[10][15]
