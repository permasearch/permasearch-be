A music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003.[2][47] Lee described the place of the filming during an interview with MTV News: "We did it in a cool, old area of town.[...] We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below.

We've got to watch that again.'"[48] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure:
