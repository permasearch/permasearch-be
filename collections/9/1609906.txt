As Elsa grieves for her sister, Anna begins to thaw, since her choice to sacrifice herself to save her elder sister rather than herself constitutes "an act of true love". Realizing love is the key to controlling her powers, Elsa is able to thaw the kingdom and use her magic safely in public. Anna confronts Hans and punches him in the face, making him fall off the ship into the water. She then buys Kristoff a previously-promised new sled and they share a kiss, starting their new relationship. Anna and Elsa's sisterly bond is rekindled, with Elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again, much to Anna's joy.
