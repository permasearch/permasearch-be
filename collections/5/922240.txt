The Hierran Wolfdog originated in the Island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands (Spain). Although its origin is still uncertain, in the 15th century dogs similar to wolves already existed in the Canary Islands, called cancha by Aboriginals. At the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the chaplains accompanying the Conquistadors wrote about the presence of "wild dogs like wolves, but they are small".[22] It is known that the Hierran Wolfdog has been present in the last two centuries and could have probably come up with the first settlers of the island. This species of dog has achieved its preference among the shepherds of the island.
