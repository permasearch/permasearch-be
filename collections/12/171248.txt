Some exceptions from the "no free lunch" tenet have been put forward, such as the Sun and carbon dioxide.[20] It was argued in particular that metabolism evolved to take advantage of the free lunch provided by the Sun, which also triggers production of vital oxygen in plants.[20] However, these too fall short in that the viewpoint is an open system, the earth, with "free" inputs from the Sun. When viewed from the larger system context, the Sun/Earth or Solar System, there is a net energy exchange, and still "no free lunch." [21]
