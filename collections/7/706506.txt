Some proposals have attempted to date Pāṇini from references within the text. The first proposal is based on sutra 2.1.70 of Pāṇini, which mentions kumāraśramaṇa, with the word śramaṇa interpreted to imply that he may have had "Buddhist nuns" in mind, and therefore he should be placed after Gautama Buddha. Other scholars question this theory because nuns in the Indian traditions existed outside of and before Buddhism, such as in Jainism.[19] The second proposal is based on the occurrence of the word yavanānī (in 4.1.49, either "Greek woman", or "Greek alphabet").[19] This occurrence of yavanānī, some suggest a terminus post quem as 519 BCE, i.e. the time of Darius I's Behistun Inscription that included the province of Gandhara (IAST: Gandhāra). However, in 1862 Max Müller objected to this interpretation with the statement that there is no reason to assume that yavana meant "Greek" before and in the century Pāṇini lived, and it could as well might have been a reference in a Semitic or a South Indian context.[20] More recently, Patrick Olivelle – a professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions, concurs and states that the term yona or yavana in Pāṇini is "merely linguistic and does not necessarily indicate that he knew or was in contact with Greek settlers", adding that while Pāṇini is generally estimated around the 5th century BCE, placing Pāṇini in a century "is an educated guess".[21]
