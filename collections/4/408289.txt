In the US, they are often referred to as clinical social workers; each state specifies the responsibilities and limitations of this profession.  State licensing boards and national certification boards require clinical social workers to have a master's or doctoral degree (MSW or DSW/PhD) from a university. The doctorate in social work requires submission of a major original contribution to the field in order to be awarded the degree.
