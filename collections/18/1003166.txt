Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,[3][97] calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had acquired much international influence on naval strategy;[3] in the end, it was adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese).  The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.
