Key signatures can be further extended through double sharps and double flats (for example, a piece in the key of G♯ major can be expressed with a double sharp on F and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G♯, the same passage could be expressed in A♭ with only four flats).
