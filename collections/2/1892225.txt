Daniel Jackson's lecture on his theories was filmed in a hotel in Los Angeles.[10] The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but the scene was trimmed for time concerns for the release.[8] The scenes with O'Neil at his house were the first scenes filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film.[10] The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, located in Long Beach, California.[10] Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith joined production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language as accurate as possible.[8]
