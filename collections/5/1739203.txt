In the 1970s, Yellowstone National Park was the centre of a heated debate over different proposals to manage the parkâ€™s problem grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). In 1978, Mark Shaffer proposed a model for the grizzlies that incorporated random variability, and calculated extinction probabilities and minimum viable population size. The first PVA is credited to Shaffer.
