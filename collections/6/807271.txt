The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium.[90] Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.[91] In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.[92] The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010.[93] The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.[94]
