"Don't Look Back" was originally this single's A-side, but was passed over by the nation's DJs in favor of the Ruffin-led "My Baby", which had a much bigger pop success than this song, and placed on the B-side.[1] The song nevertheless was promoted as if it were an A-side and would the only B-side to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 for the group (but missed the Top 40 as it peaked at #83).
