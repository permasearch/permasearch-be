The linear range for stain-free normalization is up to 80 µg protein for 18- well and up to 110 µg per lane for 12- well Criterion mid-size gels. This range works well with typical protein loads in quantitative western blots and enables loading control calculations over a wide protein-loading range.[19][20] In contrast, conventional stains such as Ponceau S and Sypro Ruby show high variability, and poor reproducibility and linearity in the range of 50-140 ug.[27, 31] When using high protein loads, stain-free technology has demonstrated higher success.[29][30]
