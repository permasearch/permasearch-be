The BPO industry has spurred employment.  BPO locators are attracted to Iloilo because of the literacy rate and number of graduates per year.[99] The Department of Science and Technology-Information and Communications Technology Office (DOST-ICTO) and Business Processing Association of the Philippines (BPAP), has named Iloilo City as one of the next wave cities. This means that Iloilo city is capable to host information technology-business process outsourcing (IT-BPO) companies on the basis of availability of talent and relevant infrastructure.[100]
