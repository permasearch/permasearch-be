A player may also choose to "lay off" some cards on an existing meld. This means that if a player can add to a sequence or a group that is in front of them or any of the other players, they may do so. For example: if another player had a sequence consisting of A♥ 2♥ 3♥ in front of them, the player would be able to add the 4♥, or 4♥ 5♥, and so on, thereby continuing the sequence. Some variations allow players to play the K♥ and wrap around. Also if a player has 3 of a kind, one of which continues another sequence on the field then another player may also continue off that card.
