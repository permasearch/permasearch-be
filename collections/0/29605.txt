In England and Wales, a person who carries anything at all with the intent to commit burglary or theft can potentially be prosecuted.[22] The penalty for this can be up to 3 years imprisonment. In the case of items specifically made or altered to be usable in burglary or theft, such as lock-picks, mere possession presumes intent â€“ there is no need to prove it.[citation needed]
