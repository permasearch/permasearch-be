In 2001, the bowl changed hands, and was relocated to Orlando. The bowl briefly became known as the Tangerine Bowl, a historic moniker, which was the original title of the game now known as the Citrus Bowl. Foot Locker, the parent company of Champs Sports, purchased naming rights in 2004, naming it the Champs Sports Bowl. In early 2012, naming rights were agreed to by Russell Athletic for games through 2017.[3] In early 2017, Camping World signed an agreement with Florida Citrus Sports to be the new title sponsor of the game through 2020.[4][5]
