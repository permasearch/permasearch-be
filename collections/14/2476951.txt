BrainPop movies may be used to introduce a new lesson or topic, for illustrating complex subject matter or to review before a test. Content is aligned to USA state education standards and is searchable by topic or state standard.[10][12] In addition to movies, the site displays quizzes, educational games, experiments and other related content that students can use interactively to reinforce the lessons in the movies.[15][16] BrainPop products are compatible with PCs, Macs, projectors and interactive whiteboards, as well as applications for tablets and smart phones. No downloading, installation or special hardware is required.[17] The movies feature recurring characters such as the robot Moby, Tim (a teenager, at BrainPop) and Annie (a younger girl, at BrainPop Jr.).[8] Most of the movies begin with the characters responding to correspondence and end humorously, often with Tim getting annoyed at Moby or vice versa.
