The accompanying music video was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in Lake Como, Italy. It features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, and currently, both are fine with their friendship. The song was included on the setlist for Stefani's debut tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and the tour's video album, as well as in the 2006 comedies, Last Holiday and Click and the 2010 drama film Somewhere.
