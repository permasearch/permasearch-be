A type of white rice, similar or identical to the Iranian chelow. The rice is first parboiled in salted water, then drained and finally baked in a brick or clay oven with oil, butter and salt added. This method creates a fluffy rice with each grain separated, while a golden-brown caramelized crust of rice ("tahdig") develops at the bottom of the baking dish.
