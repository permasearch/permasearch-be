Most Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority "no" vote in Natal.[72] Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's "Wind of Change" speech left the British faction feeling that the UK had abandoned them.[73] The more conservative English speakers supported Verwoerd;[74] others were troubled by the severing of ties with the UK and remained loyal to the Crown.[75] They were displeased by having to choose between British and South African nationalities. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent voting illustrated only a minor swell of support,[76] indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.
