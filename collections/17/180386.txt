On 6 May 2012, it was announced that Phase-I is complete and can be deployed on short notice to protect Indian cities.[200][201] New Delhi, the national capital, and Mumbai, have been selected for the ballistic missile defence shield.[202] After successful implementation in Delhi and Mumbai, the system will be used to cover other major cities in the country.[203] This shield can destroy incoming ballistic missiles launched from as far as 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) away. When the Phase II is completed and the PDV is developed, the two anti-ballistic missiles can intercept targets up to 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) both at exo and endo-atmospheric (inside the atmosphere) regions. The missiles will work in tandem to ensure a hit probability of 99.8 percent.[204][205] This system can handle multiple targets simultaneously with multiple interceptors.[206]
