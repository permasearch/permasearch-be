It originally was designated as the "Porsche 901" (901 being its internal project number). A total of 82 cars were built as 901s.[8] However, Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. Instead of selling the new model with a different name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. Internally, the cars' part numbers carried on the prefix 901 for years.[8] Production began in September 1964,[9] with the first 911s marketed to the US in February 1965.[8]
