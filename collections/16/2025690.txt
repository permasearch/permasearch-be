On Good Friday in 1898, a match was held against Woolwich Arsenal at Northumberland Park. It was attended by a record crowd of 14,000, and the refreshment stand collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof in the overcrowded ground, prompting the club to start looking for a new ground. In 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub.[36]  The White Hart Lane site, actually located behind Tottenham High Road, was a nursery owned by the brewery chain Charringtons. The club initially leased the ground from Charringtons, but development of the ground was restricted by the terms of the lease. In 1905, after issuing shares towards the cost of purchase, it bought the freehold for £8,900 and a further £2,600 for a piece of land at the northern end.[37] The ground by now had a covered stand on the west side and earth mounds on the other three.[38]
