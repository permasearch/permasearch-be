Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, Hero of Alexandria (c. AD 10â€“70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics). Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.[5] This has come to be known as emission theory.[6]
