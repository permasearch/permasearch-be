"Recessional" was reprinted in The Spectator on July 24, 1897. Kipling had composed "The White Man's Burden" for Victoria's jubilee, but replaced it with "Recessional". "Burden", which became better known, was published two years later, and was modified to fit the theme of American expansion after the Spanishâ€“American War.[7] Kipling included the poem in his 1903 collection The Five Nations.
