Starting in the 2014 season, NBC was allowed to flex games beginning in week 5.  All the previous flexible scheduling rules apply, but on a limited basis.  Only two games between weeks 5-10 can be flexed per season; weeks 11-17 (excluding Thanksgiving Night) flex rules are still the same as in previous years.  However, despite these changes, NBC did not flex a single one of their originally scheduled games, which marked the first season that none of the originally scheduled Sunday night games for the entire season (other than week 17) were flexed out. (Note: the kickoff for the Ravens-Patriots Divisional Playoff game was at 4:35 ET)
