A reflection of the close relationship between the Gupta family and Jacob Zuma, particularly by both Zuma and the family's detractors, is the term "Zupta" to refer to this relationship. The portmanteau "Zupta," a combination of "Z" from "Zuma" and the "upta" from "Gupta," was first coined by the Economic Freedom Fighters at the 2016 South African presidential state of the nation address when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting "Zupta must fall" to express their dissatisfaction with this relationship.[44][45]
