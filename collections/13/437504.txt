Archeological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee,[37][38] on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, were originally thought to reveal evidence of a turf wall and the roasting of bog iron ore, and therefore a possible second 10th century Norse settlement in Canada.[39] Findings from the 2016 excavation suggest the turf wall and the roasted bog iron ore discovered in 2015 were the result of natural processes.[40] The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery in 2014,[41] and archaeologists excavated the area in 2015 and 2016.[41][39] Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, one of the leading experts of Norse archaeology in North America and an expert on the Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, is unsure of the identification of Point Rosee as a Norse site.[42] Archaeologist Karen Milek was a member of the 2016 Point Rosee excavation and is a Norse expert. She also expressed doubt that Point Rosee was a Norse site as there are no good landing sites for their boats and there are steep cliffs between the shoreline and the excavation site.[43] In their November 8, 2017, report[44] Sarah Parcak and Gregory Mumford, co-directors of the excavation, wrote that they "found no evidence whatsoever for either a Norse presence or human activity at Point Rosee prior to the historic period"[38] and that "None of the team members, including the Norse specialists, deemed this area as having any traces of human activity."[37]
