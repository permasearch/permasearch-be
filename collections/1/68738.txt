In April 2016, Walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from battery cages from its supply chain by 2025.[278] The decision was particularly important because of Walmart's large market share and influence on the rest of the industry.[279][280] The move was praised by major animal welfare groups[281] and heralded as an "end of an era" by Humane Society of the United States President Wayne Pacelle,[282] but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decision's impact.[281] Walmart's cage-free eggs will not come from free range producers, but rather industrial-scale farms where the birds will be allotted between 1 and 1.5 square feet each, a stressful arrangement which can cause cannibalism.[279][281] Unlike battery cages, the systems Walmart's suppliers will use allow the hens to move around, but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems.[283]
