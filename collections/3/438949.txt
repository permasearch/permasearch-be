The origin of finite method can be traced to the matrix analysis of structures [1][2] where the concept of a displacement or stiffness matrix approach was introduced. Finite element concepts were developed based on engineering methods in 1950s. The finite element method obtained its real impetus in the 1960s and 1970s by John Argyris, and co-workers; at the University of Stuttgart, by Ray W. Clough; at the University of California, Berkeley, by Olgierd Zienkiewicz, and co-workers Ernest Hinton, Bruce Irons;[3] at the University of Swansea, by Philippe G. Ciarlet; at the University of Paris; at Cornell University, by Richard Gallagher and co-workers. The original works such as those by Argyris [4] and Clough [5] became the foundation for todayâ€™s finite element structural analysis methods. Earlier books such as by Zienkiewicz [6] and more recent books such as by Yang [7] give comprehensive summary of developments in finite-element structural analysis. Implementing the method in software is described in the classic text by Smith, Griffiths and Margetts.[8]
