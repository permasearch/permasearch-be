After the intermission, the second act began with a performance of "Invisible" as a recreation of the Berlin Wall on the video screen dissolved to reveal U2 inside.[18] The group remained inside the screen to perform half of "Even Better Than the Real Thing" before emerging to finish the song on-stage. For the next sequence, beginning with "Mysterious Ways", the band performed on the B-stage and the show was filmed by a fan on-stage with a mobile phone for live streaming online through the mobile app Meerkat. These performances were also projected onto the set's video screens. The live streams were first used during U2's Phoenix and Los Angeles shows.[70] Either "Elevation" or "Desire" were usually played next, although U2 sometimes rotated songs in their place at different concerts, such as "Ordinary Love" and "Volcano".
