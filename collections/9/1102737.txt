Norwegian Forest cats have a quiet voice but can develop a loud voice if kept in a house with a dog.[7] They are friendly, intelligent, and generally good with people.[4] The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy[4] and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life.[6] If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800.[24] The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old.[24] As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds.[5][24]
