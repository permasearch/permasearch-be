Lucy Stillman (voiced by and modelled on Kristen Bell)[3] (1988â€“2012) was a member of the Assassin Order and a genetic memory researcher for Abstergo Industries' Animus Project. During her infiltration of Abstergo, she reported information on the company's recent activities to the Assassins. However, Lucy's lengthy separation from the Assassin Order and her distrust for William Miles led to her secret defection to the Templar cause prior to 2011. When Desmond Miles was brought into Abstergo for testing, Warren Vidic instructed Lucy to earn Desmond's trust, so that the Templars could ultimately find the Piece of Eden located within his memories, and use it for their Eye-Abstergo satellite. As Desmond's condition began to worsen however, Warren and Lucy turned to more drastic measures, and formulated Project Siren. Lucy was ordered to take Desmond somewhere he would feel safe, and the two Templars orchestrated Desmond's and her escape from Abstergo. Lucy carried out her orders, and relocated Desmond to a hideout to join his fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane. After a month, and another relocation to the ruined Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, the Assassin team discovered the location of an Apple of Eden, which was inside the Colosseum Vault. When Desmond's hand made contact with the Apple, his body was possessed by Juno, a member of the First Civilization. With her knowledge of Lucy's true allegiance, Juno forced Desmond to stab and kill Lucy with his Hidden Blade.
