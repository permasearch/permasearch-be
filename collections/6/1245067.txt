Delays at two zones in the CBD were announced in August 2016. Originally meant to be completed before Christmas 2016, construction work at these zones was to continue for several months longer than originally anticipated.[31] The zones were eventually opened around a year after the planned completion date.[32] Further delays to the project arose during 2016.[33]
