Some venues have added a wager called Prime in United Kingdom casinos and the game is known as Prime Three Card Poker. The Prime wager is optionally placed before cards are dealt and pays on the color of the player cards. If all three cards are the same color the payoff is 3 to 1. However when included with the dealer hand if all six cards are the same color then the payoff is increased to 4 to 1. The house advantage on this wager is 3.62%.
