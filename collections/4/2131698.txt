New Zealand's previous Labour government introduced a number of measures in the 2000s as part of the vision of New Zealand becoming carbon neutral by 2020,[13][14] and intended to collect levies for greenhouse effect emissions from 2010 onwards, to be added to power prices depending on the level of emissions.[15] However, the incoming National government quickly tabled legislation to repeal various of these measures, such as obligatory targets for biofuel percentages,[16] a ban on construction of new fossil fueled generation plants[17] and a ban on future sales of incandescent light bulbs.[18]
