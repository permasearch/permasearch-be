Democratic strength is chiefly concentrated in the central and certain southern areas of the county. This includes the southeastern Village of Freeport which is roughly sixty-eight percent Democratic, central areas near the Village of Hempstead and Uniondale, where there are large middle-class populations as well. There are also staunch Democratic pockets in the equally affluent Five Towns area in the southwest part of the county and in Long Beach.
