The mid-series premiere, "Let's Kill Hitler", was intended to be the opposite of the "grim and dark" tone of the series premiere.[40] Mark Gatiss wrote "Night Terrors" to be a scary episode, surprised that dolls had not been used in Doctor Who before.[41] "The Girl Who Waited" is a "Doctor-lite" episode[42] which allowed Tom MacRae to explore Amy and Rory's characters and relationship.[43] The concept of "The God Complex" was originally pitched by Toby Whithouse for the fifth series, but it was pushed back as Moffat felt that it was too similar to the stories in that series.[44][45] The penultimate episode, "Closing Time", is a sequel to series five's "The Lodger" and allows the Doctor to have some fun while building up to the finale.[46] Writer Gareth Roberts also wanted to bring back the Cybermen, there were no other returning monsters in the series and he thought "there should be a sense of history about the Doctor's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death".[47] The finale was described by Moffat as "a big roller coaster ride of Doctor Who madness" and concludes the Doctor's death arc,[48] though it intentionally leaves some mysteries.[49]
