Similar to "If I Can't Love Her", "Evermore" provides the Beast with "a stronger voice".[36] The song occurs at a pivotal moment in the film during which the Beast bemoans his decision to free Belle,[37] while uncovering both his inner pain and growth as a character as he voices "a sad sense of longing."[38] For the first time, audiences learn exactly how the Beast feels when he allows Belle to rescue Maurice,[39] summarizing his love for her.[40] In the musical sequence, the Beast continues to climb higher up the turret of his castle to watch Belle as she rides away on her horse and gradually disappears into the distance.[29] Staged in a way that resembles a live musical due to Stevens' performance and its cinematography,[39] the orchestra increases and swells as the anguished Beast continues to climb.[41] Menken explained that the character, singing "with a raw emotion",[42] watches Belle leave while thinking to himself "I know what love is now, and it's wonderful, even though I'll never see her again",[43] and "Evermore" captures the Beast's agony as he watches the woman he loves leave him.[44] Citing the song as an example of the film's characters resorting to singing whenever they find that they are not able to speak, Condon described "Evermore" as one of the film's "dramatic high points", proving that the Beast has finally become "worthy of love".[8] For the Beast, the song represents "an ode to his love for Belle and his unending, longing devotion as she rides away from him, possibly forever",[45] serving as "a profound meditation on his own isolation and heartache".[46] According to Menken, the character is "basically singing about how he now knows what love is".[29] The Beast is now shown to be capable of feeling and expressing human emotions,[19] namely heartbreak, loneliness and helplessness,[45] having learned about true love and sacrifice.[47] According to Zoe Nicholson of The Daily Gamecock, "Evermore" "adds humanity not yet seen in a character regarded as savage or spoiled rotten."[48] Walt Disney Studios president of music and soundtracks Mitchell Leib described the scene as the film's "Phantom of the Opera moment."[14] Traditionally in Disney films, heroines are typically assigned "rousing" musical numbers to perform.[49] Screen Rant contributor Kacey Spivey observed that Belle's departure and the scene represents a reversal of the traditional fairy tale trope in which a princess is trapped in a tower.[45] Instead the Beast is confined to his tower, longing for the heroine to return and free him from his enchantment.[45] Brett Nachman compared the scene to Quasimodo performing "Out There" in Disney's animated musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).[25]
