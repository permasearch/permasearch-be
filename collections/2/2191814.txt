Steve Rose, the reviewer for The Guardian, gave the film four out of five stars, describing it as "a gentle and entrancing tale, deeper and richer than more instantly gratifying fare."[45] Rose also described the film as "the soul food of the animation world,"[45] however, he did note that this film "doesn't match previous hits such as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke in terms of epic scale or adult appeal", even though it bears many of their hallmarks: bright, detailed animation..."[45] Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film. She said that the film "remains essentially a film for children".[46] Young later went on to say that the relationship with Sho and Arrietty "touches the heartstrings with gentle yearning", and praised Yonebayashi for its direction.[46] In the opening remarks made by David Gritten of The Telegraph, he said that the film was "ravishingly colourful and textured".[47] He also praised the animation, saying that "animation doesnâ€™t get better than Arrietty."[47] Gritten gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 stars.[47] In his review for Special Broadcasting Service, Don Groves gave a mixed review of the film and said that Arrietty was a "very slender, minor work."[48] Groves also criticized the film's storyline, calling it "a gentle, humourless, uncomplicated tale of friendship in an alien environment." However, he praised the voice acting as "generally is as professional as [one would] expect."[48] Groves gave the film a rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 stars.[48]
