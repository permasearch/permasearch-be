Originally it was an accounting and commercial invoice abbreviation meaning "at a rate of" (e.g. 7 widgets @ £2 = £14).[1] Although not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters, it was on at least one 1889 model[2] and the very successful Underwood models from the "Underwood No. 5" in 1900 onward; and is now universally included on computer keyboards.
