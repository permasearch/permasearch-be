The Mexico City policy—also known as the "global gag rule"—required any non-governmental organization receiving U.S. government funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services in other countries. This had a significant effect on the health policies of many nations across the globe. The Mexico City policy was instituted under President Reagan, suspended under President Clinton, reinstated by President George W. Bush,[102] and suspended again by President Barack Obama on 24 January 2009[103] and re-instated once again by President Donald J. Trump on 23 January 2017.[citation needed]
