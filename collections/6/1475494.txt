The Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.[118][119][126] In 1967 the then National Capital Development Commission adopted the "Y Plan" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,[127] with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.[127]
