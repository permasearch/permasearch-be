In May 2011, the Gillard government announced plans to address the issue by swapping new asylum seekers for long-standing assessed refugees in Malaysia. The so-called Malaysian Solution was eventually ruled unconstitutional, partly because Malaysia was not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention.[34] In 2011, Australia received 2.5% of the world's total number of claims for asylum.[35] During 2012, more than 17,000 asylum seekers arrived via boat.[36] The majority of the refugees came from Afghanistan, Iran, and Sri Lanka.[1]
