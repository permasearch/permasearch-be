The main line of descent from Hugh Capet is generally known as the "direct Capetians".  This line became extinct in 1328, precipitating a succession crisis known as the Hundred Years War.  While there were numerous claimants to succeed, the two best claimants were the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet.
