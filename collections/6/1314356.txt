Throughout the 18th century, Newport suffered from an imbalance of trade with the largest colonial ports.  As a result, Newport merchants were forced to develop alternatives to conventional exports.[13] In the 1720s, Colonial leaders arrested many pirates, acting under pressure from the British government. Many were hanged in Newport and were buried on Goat Island.
