German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self-assured.[11] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become over-protective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. [18]They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[19] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as being protective of their owners.[20]
