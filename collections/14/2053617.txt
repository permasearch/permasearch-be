In August 2015, Universal Orlando announced that the Incredible Hulk roller coaster would undergo major refurbishment that would involve the addition of new trains, a new storyline and a completely new ride experience. The ride had operated since opening day and closed on 8 September 2015 for its refurbishment. The refurbishment later saw the ride get completely retracked, the ride receiving a new onboard soundtrack composed by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy and the ride's storyline being changed alongside an updated queue line. The ride reopened with these changes on 4 August 2016.
