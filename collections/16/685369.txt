The current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named "Mac OS X" until 2012 and then "OS X" until 2016.[3] Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT, Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced. The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually.[4] It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[5]
