South Africa is a sunny country, averaging 8-10 daily sunshine hours in most regions.[2] The average annual rainfall for South Africa is 450ml(compared to a global average of 860ml) but large and unpredictable variations are common. Overall, rainfall is greatest in the east and gradually decreases westward, with some semi-desert areas along the western edge of South Africa. For most of the country, rain falls mainly in the summer months with brief afternoon thunderstorms. The exception is the Western Cape and its capital city Cape Town where the climate is Mediterranean and it rains more in the wintertime.[3]In the winter months, snow collects on the high mountains of the Cape and the Drakensberg.
