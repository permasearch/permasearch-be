Played by Constance Marie, Regina Lourdes Vasquez is the legal mother of Daphne Vasquez and the biological mother of Bay Kennish. Before moving into the Kennishes' guest house, she, Daphne, and her mother Adriana lived in fictional working-class neighborhood East Riverside, Missouri, where she worked as a hair stylist. Prior to the beginning of the series, Regina had been raising Daphne as a single mother. Daphne's legal father, Angelo, abandoned their family after finding out that Daphne was not his daughter. After Angelo's leaving, Regina had Daphne tested again, only for the tests to reveal that Daphne was not her biological daughter either. In spite of this revelation, Regina chooses to keep the information to herself for fear of Daphne being taken away from her. This fact comes to light when photos of Bay are discovered, Regina having had a Private Investigator keep tabs on her biological daughter throughout the years.
