In addition to the Quick Race and Career modes, there is also a "Challenge Series" mode involving 69 progressively difficult challenges where players are required to successfully complete Tollbooth races and pursuit challenges, such as tagging a number of police cars. The pre-tuned cars used in each Challenge is fixed, ranging from mostly Career cars with poor handling to traffic vehicles such as a dump truck or police cars. Additional bonus cars may be unlocked as the player progresses through Challenge mode. The Challenge mode also has a cheat; by entering the words 'burgerking', or for consoles by pressing a certain code on the d-pad, at the start of the game, the player can avail the exclusive Burger King challenge. Once successfully completed, the game will reward you with something, such as "Junkman" parts. You can equip these parts to your vehicles in the "My Cars" menu to provide extra performance to your car. These parts are not available in "Career Mode".
