Kiddo captures O-Ren's lawyer Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) and brings her to O-Ren, where she cuts off Sofie's left arm and challenges O-Ren to a duel. Kiddo first kills the six members of the Crazy 88 who were with O-Ren, then battles O-Ren's bodyguard Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) in single combat, killing her as well. The rest of the Crazy 88 – led by Johnny Mo – arrive. She kills, injures, and dismembers them. She then faces off against O-Ren in a dramatic sword fight in a snow-covered garden. At the end of the duel, Kiddo cuts off the top of O-Ren's head, killing her.
