Cadbury's products were first imported into Australia as early as 1853 when 3 cases of Cadbury's cocoa and chocolate were advertised for sale in Adelaide.[79] Cadburyâ€™s first overseas order in 1881 was made for the Australian market. In 1919, as part of its plans to expand internationally, the company decided to build a factory in Australia. In 1920 Claremont, Tasmania was chosen for the location because of its close proximity to the city of Hobart, good source of inexpensive hydro-electricity and plentiful supply of high-quality fresh milk. The first products from the factory were sold in 1922.[80] The Claremont factory was modelled on Bournville, with its own village and sporting facilities.[81][82] Cadbury operates three Australian factories; two in Melbourne, Victoria (Ringwood and Scoresby), and one in Hobart, Tasmania (Claremont). Cadbury also operates a milk processing plant in Cooee, Tasmania. Claremont factory was once a popular tourist attraction and operated daily tours; however, the factory ceased running full tours mid-2008, citing health and safety reasons.[83] Cadbury has been upgrading its manufacturing facility at Claremont, Tasmania, Australia, since 2001[84]
