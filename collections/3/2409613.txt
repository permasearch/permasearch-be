Because the long linear chains of amylose more readily crystallize than amylopectin (which has short, highly branched chains), high-amylose starch is more resistant to digestion.[7] Unlike amylopectin, amylose is not soluble in cold water.[8] It also reduces the crystallinity of amylopectin and how easily water can infiltrate the starch.[6] The higher the amylose content, the less expansion potential and the lower the gel strength for the same starch concentration. This can be countered partially by increasing the granule size.[9]
