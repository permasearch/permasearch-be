Although Winona Ryder was the first cast member attached to the script,[10] Dianne Wiest was the first to sign on. "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested".[12] When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered;[13] Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him", Burton remembered. "He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up".[12] Cruise asked for a "happier" ending.[14] Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part,[15] the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities.[16] Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late."[17] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role,[18] while Thompson favored John Cusack.[13] Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest,[16] although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.[13]
