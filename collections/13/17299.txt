In the 2006 skit for the Children's Party at the Palace, it is revealed Augusta keeps a mousetrap in her bag. Neville explains that his grandfather placed a Fanged Gerbil in Augusta's bag in 1947, believing it would be funny. Augusta didn't agree with this, particularly after the gerbil bit her, and placed a mousetrap in her bag to prevent a repeat of this happening again.
