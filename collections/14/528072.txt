Bhakti is sometimes private inside household shrines and sometimes practiced as a community. It may include Puja, Aarti,[281] musical Kirtan or singing Bhajan, where devotional verses and hymns are read or poems are sung by a group of devotees.[282][283] While the choice of the deity is at the discretion of the Hindu, the most observed traditions of Hindu devotionalism include Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva) and Shaktism (Shakti).[284] A Hindu may worship multiple deities, all as henotheistic manifestations of the same ultimate reality, cosmic spirit and absolute spiritual concept called Brahman in Hinduism.[285][286][note 19]
