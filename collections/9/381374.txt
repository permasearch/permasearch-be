An interesting issue is Japanese fishing boats. If one of these was blown out to sea and lacked proper equipment it would be carried by the current to North America. Japanese boats reached Acapulco in 1617, the Aleutians in 1782, Alaska in 1805, the mouth of the Columbia River in 1820 and Cape Flattery in 1833. If this happened when there were Europeans around to make records, there may have been earlier ones.[1]
