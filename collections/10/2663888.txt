Finn was promoted to chief petty officer (E-7, the highest enlisted rank in the Navy at that time[5]) in 1935 after only nine years of active duty. He later commented on his promotions, "Everybody thought I was a boy wonder. I was just in the right place at the right time."[6] As a chief, Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego, Washington, and Panama.[4][7]
