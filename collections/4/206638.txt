During the 1960s, Zhivkov initiated reforms and passed some market-oriented policies on an experimental level.[95] By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.[96] Lyudmila Zhivkova, daughter of Todor Zhivkov, promoted Bulgaria's national heritage, culture and arts on a global scale.[97] An assimilation campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey,[98][99] which caused a significant drop in agricultural production due to the loss of labor force.[100]
