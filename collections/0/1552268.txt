The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) has been the major preservation organization involved at Brandy Station. The Trust, supplemented by the BSF and other partners, has acquired and preserved 2,159 acres (8.74Â km2) of the battlefield in more than 15 separate acquisitions since 1997.[24][25] In 2003, this led to the opening of Brandy Station Battlefield Park, which interprets the history of the site. This work has prevented a number of commercial enterprises from infringing on the battleground, including a proposed Formula One racetrack in the late 1990s.[26] In 2013, the Trust achieved a major preservation success by purchasing a 61-acre tract at Fleetwood Hill, site of a number of significant cavalry charges during the battle.[27]
