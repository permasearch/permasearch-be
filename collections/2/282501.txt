During the Middle Ages, under the influence of the Catholic Church, many Western European countries moved the start of the year to one of several important Christian festivalsâ€”25 December (supposed Nativity of Jesus), 25 March (Annunciation), or Easter (France),[38] while the Byzantine Empire began its year on 1 September and Russia did so on 1 March until 1492 when the new year was moved to 1 September.[39]
