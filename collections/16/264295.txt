A current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to Ampere's law.[3] The advantage of using the coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current. The magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add (superpose) to produce a strong field there.[3] The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced. Conversely, a changing external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to Faraday's law of induction.[3][4] The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil, because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.[3]
