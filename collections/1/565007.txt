If the problem cannot be sorted out with reference to the language, a court may be informed of the background circumstances under which the contract was concluded. These are matters of an uncontentious nature, such as the relationship in which the parties stood to one another at the time of contracting, which may help to explain the context of the contract. They convey "the genesis and purpose of the contract, i.e. [...] matters probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted,"[118] but not the actual negotiations and similar statements.[119] The sole purpose of such evidence, it is still said, is to enable the court to understand the broad context in which the words requiring interpretation were used. Although "it is commonly said that the Court is entitled to be informed of all such circumstances in all cases,"[120] this does not permit it to arrive at a different interpretation if the meaning is already clear from the words themselves.
