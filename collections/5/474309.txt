On July 31, 1980, in Long Beach, California, tempers boiled over into what has been described as the "Long Night at Wrong Beach."[51][52] The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, "You're welcome â€“ I guess" to California Senator Alan Cranston's wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his reelection.[53] Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage. "Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal," Frey recalled Felder telling him near the end of the band's set.[54] Felder recalls Frey telling him during "Best of My Love," "I'm gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage."[51][55]
