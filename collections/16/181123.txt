Although Walt Disney initially purchased the film rights to "The Ill-Made Knight" in 1944,[6] he eventually produced an adaptation of "The Sword in the Stone" (released in 1963). This movie reflects more the sense of humour of Disney's team of animators than White's. The movie adds a more comical side to the original story, including song and dance, as in most Walt Disney films. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's 1960 musical Camelot (which was made into a movie in 1967) is based mostly on the last two books of "The Once and Future King" and features White's idea of having Thomas Malory make a cameo appearance at the end, again as "Tom of Warwick".
