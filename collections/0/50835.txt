Originally, the full name was "hashed brown potatoes" (or "hashed browned potatoes"), of which the first known mention is by American food author Maria Parloa (1843â€“1909) in 1888.[5] The name was gradually shortened to 'hash brown potatoes'.[6] Bite sized Hash Browns are small cylindrical dumplings, known as Tater Tots in the U.S. and Potato Gems in Australia, and are sold commercially at diners and in frozen food aisles in packets.
