Until 1989, Lego minifigures only came in a yellow skin color with standard smiling face, though early prototypes had a variety of skin colors and facial expressions. Lego Pirates in 1989 expanded the array of facial expressions with beards and eye patches, followed by sun glasses, lipstick, eyelashes, and so on. However, many older collectors resented the new look, saying they looked too "cartoon-ish" or "kiddy", and preferred the simplistic nature of the two eyes and smile.
