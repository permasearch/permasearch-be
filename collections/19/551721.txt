The Cathedral is home to 30 Nationality Rooms located on the first and third floors: 28 working classrooms and two rooms used mostly for display or occasional special events. Each nationality room is designed to celebrate a different culture that had an influence on Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to (or in the singular case of the French Classroom, just after) 1787, which is year of the university's founding and the signing of the US Constitution.
