Cortana's first appearance in the Halo franchise is in the novel Halo: The Fall of Reach, a prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge.[10] Cortana also appears in the novelization of Combat Evolved,  Halo: The Flood, and the following novels Halo: First Strike and Halo: Ghosts of Onyx.[11] She is the main character in "Human Weakness", a short story written by Karen Traviss for the Halo Evolutions anthology and details her time imprisoned by the Gravemind.
