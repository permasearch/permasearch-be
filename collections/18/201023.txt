Taken to Ape City and caged, Taylor and a mute female (whom he later calls Nova) share a laboratory cell, and chimpanzee psychologist Dr. Zira hopes the two will mate. When Zira discovers that Taylor has intelligence beyond any human she has ever seen, she takes him out of the laboratory to meet her fiancé Dr. Cornelius. Both disbelieve Taylor's assertion that he's actually a visitor from a faraway planet, but they think he might be living proof of human intelligence – if not a missing link between humans and their "evolved superiors", the apes.
