In July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the English national team,[94] and former Everton and Manchester United manager David Moyes was appointed as his replacement.[95] Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just two points from their opening 10 matches.[96] The club was relegated to the second tier for the first time in 10 years at the end of the 2016–17 season, finishing bottom of the table with 24 points,[97] and Moyes resigned as manager.[98] In June 2017, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, a product of Sunderland's academy who joined the club aged eight, was transferred to Everton for a fee of £25 million, rising to a possible £30 million, a record for a British goalkeeper.[99]
