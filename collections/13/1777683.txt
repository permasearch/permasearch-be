The 1200 block of Wood Avenue is the site of the second president's house for Colorado College and Stewart House, which was donated to the institution by Philip B. Stewart. Also on the block is the former house of Alice Bemis Taylor who was a significant benefactor to the school. Taylor Dining Hall, now a theater, was named for her and Bemis Hall was named for her father. Charles L. Tutt Sr.'s house at Uintah and Cascade was donated to the college and is now the Tutt Alumni House.[17]
