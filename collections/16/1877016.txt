When Rose found out that Katerina had escaped from Klaus with the moonstone, she realized the repercussions of Klaus and was not willing to partake in the sacrifice Trevor was willing to offer. She locked Katerina in a room and told her that she would take her to Klaus as soon as the opportunity arose. Katerina faked her suicide by stabbing herself with a knife, saying she would rather die than go back to Klaus, but this was a ruse to force Rose to feed her some of her blood to heal her. As soon as Rose turned her back to confront Trevor, Katerina hung herself. Later, when she woke up in transition, Trevor asked why she did it and claimed he would've helped her live. Katerina says that he would have been able to help her run and that running was never going to be enough. Rose explains to Trevor that Katerina used him as a means of escape. Knowing that Klaus would see their role in the escape, Rose attempted to kill Katerina with a stake. Katerina used the owner of the cabin as a shield, which resulted in her death. Katerina then gave in to her instincts and drained the little old lady, completing her transition into a vampire. She then threw the body towards Rose and Trevor and fled. This happened on April 6, 1492.
