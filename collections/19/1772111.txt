P. O. Ackley created an improved version of this cartridge called the .243 Winchester Improved (Ackley).[7] Like other improved cartridges, this created a steeper shoulder and blew the sides out, giving about 10% more powder capacity, and some small improvement in velocity. Both versions of the .243 cartridge are good for hunting deer.
