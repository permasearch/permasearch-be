The reception of The Whale in Britain and of Moby-Dick in the United States differed in two ways, according to Parker. First, British literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still young republic, with British reviewing done by "cadres of brilliant literary people"[130] who were "experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists",[131] while the United States had only "a handful of reviewers" capable enought to be called critics, and American editors and reviewers habitually echoed British opinion.[132] American reviewing was mostly delegated to "newspaper staffers" or else by "amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen."[131] Second, the differences between the two editions caused "two distinct critical receptions."[133]
