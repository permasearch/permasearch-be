The group originally consisted of Charles Nicholas "Chas" Hodges (piano, vocals, banjo, guitars) and David Victor "Dave" Peacock (bass guitar, vocals, piano, banjo, guitar, ukulele), with sidesman Mick Burt on drums. In 2011, Burt retired from the band with Chas's son, Nicholas Charles "Nik" Hodges taking over on drums. In the 1970s Chas & Dave were prominent session musicians, playing for a wide range of artists; for instance â€“ the hook used on Eminem's "My Name Is" was taken from a Labi Siffre tune, "I Got The...", on which Chas & Dave performed.[3]
