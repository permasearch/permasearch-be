With the turn of the century, "Better Off Alone" has been described as a turning point in the development of a commercialized trance sound. This sound shared by related compositions such as "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" by Eiffel 65 that surfaced around the same time.[8] Co-founder of Dash Berlin Jeffrey Sutorious stated, "It became such a huge chart hit around the world that many people categorised it as Euro Dance, when in fact it started out as vocal trance". Eelke Kalberg and Sebastiaan Molijn are Dash Berlin's other co-founders.[3] Entertainment Weekly described the song as "techno-pop" while Spin described it as a "trance-fueled Eurodance".[6][9]
