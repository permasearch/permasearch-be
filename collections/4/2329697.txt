An ice trade also developed in Europe. By the 1870s hundreds of men were employed to cut ice from the glaciers at Grindelwald in Switzerland, and Paris in France began to import ice from the rest of Europe in 1869.[81] Meanwhile, Norway entered the international ice trade, focusing on exports to England. The first shipments from Norway to England had occurred in 1822, but larger scale exports did not occur until the 1850s.[82] The ice harvesting was initially centred on the fjords of the west coast, but poor local transport links pushed the trade south and east to the main centres of the Norwegian timber and shipping industries, both essential for ice exporting.[83] In the early 1860s, Lake Oppeg√•rd in Norway was renamed "Wenham Lake" with the aim of confusing the product with New England exports, and exports to England increased.[84] Initially these were run by British business interests, but eventually transitioned to Norwegian companies.[84] Distribution of the Norwegian ice across Britain was helped by the growing railway networks, while the railway connection built between the fishing port of Grimsby and London in 1853 created a demand for ice to allow the transport of fresh fish to the capital.[85]
