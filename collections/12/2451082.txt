Almond milk is a plant milk manufactured from almonds with a creamy texture and nutty flavor,[1] although other types or brands are flavored in imitation of dairy milk.[2] It contains neither cholesterol nor lactose, and is often consumed by those who are lactose-intolerant and others who wish to avoid dairy products, including vegans. Commercial almond milk comes in sweetened, unsweetened, plain, vanilla and chocolate flavors, and is usually fortified with micronutrients. It can also be made at home using a blender, almonds and water.[3]
