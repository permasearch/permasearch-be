Philadelphia School District receives state funding to provide taxpayer funded preschool at the elementary schools. For the 2013-14 school year, Philadelphia School District received a Pre K Counts grant of $19,900,120.[76] For the 2011 school year, Philadelphia School District was a high priority for funding due to the high poverty level of children in the district's attendance area.[77][78][79] In 2011 the District received $20,512,350 in PreK Count grant funding to fund 2,406 children attending prechool. Enrollment for Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts is targeted to children living in families earning up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.
