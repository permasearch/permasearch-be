The Chas Brownlow Trophy, better known as the Brownlow Medal, is the medal awarded to the "fairest and best" player in the Australian Football League during the regular season (i.e. not including finals matches) as decided upon by umpires. It was named after a Geelong player and long-serving administrator who was the main advocate in establishing the Victorian Football League,  Charles Brownlow. It is awarded at a special dinner on the Monday night before the grand final, recently at the Crown Casino in Melbourne.
