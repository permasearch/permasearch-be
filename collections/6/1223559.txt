Paired with her brother Helios, Selene adorned the east pediment of the Parthenon, where the two framed a scene depicting the birth of Athena, with Helios driving his chariot rising from the ocean on the left, and Selene and her chariot descending into the sea on the right.[52] From Pausanias, we learn that Selene and Helios also framed the birth of Aphrodite on the base of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia.[53] There are indications of a similar framing by Selene and Helios of the birth of Pandora on the base of the Athena Parthenos.[54] Selene also appears on horseback as part of the Gigantomachy frieze of the Pergamon Altar.[55]
