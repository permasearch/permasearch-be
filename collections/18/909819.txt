Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread and wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that John 6:58â€“59 (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a Eucharistic nature and resonates with the "words of institution" used in the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.[24]
