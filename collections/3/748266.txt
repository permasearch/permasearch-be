Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on April 17, 2012.[40] The home media releases, however, do not preserve the original IMAX imagery,[41][42] and its aspect ratio is consistently cropped to 2.40:1 rather than switching to a 1.78:1 aspect ratio during the IMAX scenes. Blu-ray Disc releases such as The Dark Knight,[43] Tron: Legacy,[44] and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen[45] will switch between 2.40:1 for regular scenes and 1.78:1 for IMAX scenes.
