As late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life.[42] By 1910 most farmers subscribed to a farm newspaper, where editors promoted efficiency as applied to farming.[43] Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of Appalachia and the Ozarks.[44]
