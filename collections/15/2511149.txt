There was a vogue for what was called 'silver-fork fiction'—novels depicting aristocratic life, usually by anonymous authors, read avidly by the aspirational middle classes.[45] Disraeli's first novel, Vivian Grey, published anonymously in four volumes in 1826–27 when he was just 23, was a thinly veiled re-telling of the history of The Representative.[46] It sold well, but reviewers were sharply critical of both the author and the book because its numerous solecisms made it obvious the author did not move in high society. When Disraeli's authorship was discovered, many in high society's most influential circles, already offended, knew where to place their ire.[46] Furthermore, Murray and Lockhart, who had great power in the literary and publishing spheres, believed that Disraeli had caricatured them and abused their confidence—an accusation he denied but many of his biographers have given credence to.[47] In later editions Disraeli made many changes to the novel, softening his satire, but the damage to his reputation proved long-lasting.[43]
