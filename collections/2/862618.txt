An alapana, sometimes also called ragam,[33] is the exposition of a raga or tone â€“ a slow improvisation with no rhythm,[34] where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment.[26] In performing alapana, performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought.[26]
