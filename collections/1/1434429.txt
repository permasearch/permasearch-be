The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta of England and Wales and Its Provinces Overseas, better known as the Knights Templar, is a Masonic body founded in its current form in 1895 which bases its esoteric symbolism on the historic Crusading orders, the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller (which still exists as the Knights of Malta). This order accepts freemasons "in good standing", who have been through the degrees of the Holy Royal Arch. In England, the order is headquartered at Mark Masons' Hall, London and is governed under the auspices of the Order of Mark Master Masons. The organisation has no direct lineal connection to the historical Catholic military orders from which it is named.
