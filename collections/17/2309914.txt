Bluestar fell in love with Oakheart, a RiverClan warrior and brother to Crookedstar, during her days as a warrior (when she was named Bluefur, as seen in The Rise of Scourge and Bluestar's Prophecy). During this time another warrior of ThunderClan (Thrushpelt, as seen in Bluestar's Prophecy) began to show interest in her. She bore three of Oakheart's kits, but let the Clan believe Thrushpelt was the father, and Thrushpelt was kind enough to pretend for her. Out of her concern to the Clan, she decided to become Clan deputy instead of the violent Thistleclaw, but since she knew the Clan would never accept a queen nursing kits for a deputy, she secretly gave her kits to Oakheart to be raised in RiverClan. Only Mistykit and Stonekit made it to RiverClan; Mosskit did not survive the journey because of the cold.
