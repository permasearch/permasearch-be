The theater's interior walls retain the original Art Deco murals by John Gabriel Beckman. The theater's facade had a painted mural of an Art Deco style underwater world scene, which was later replaced with replications of Beckman's design created in Catalina Pottery style tiles. The lobby has walnut wood paneling.
