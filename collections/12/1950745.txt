The character of Horatio Caine received very positive feedback from critics,[who?] with Caruso's performance as the character being the most praised. Horatio gathered a cult following as well.[citation needed] On an episode of the Late Show with David Letterman that aired on March 8, 2007, comedian Jim Carrey professed to being a fan of the show and went on to satirically impersonate Caruso's character. Caruso said in an interview with CBS that he was impressed with Carrey's impersonation.[1][better source needed]
