The temple was rebuilt many times, for it was destroyed many times. The first destruction of the temple was by the Gauls in 390 BCE.[5] According to Ovid, the second time was in 241 BCE; after fire destroyed much of Vesta's temple, Lucius Caecilius Metellus who was Pontifex Maximus at the time, saved the palladium and according to tradition was blinded in the incident.[6] Such fires occurred again in 210 BCE and again in the early first century BCE; however, the building was safe. It was rebuilt again during the reigns of Augustus and Nero. Finally, it burnt down in 191 CE and was later built for the last time during the reign of Septimius Severus.[7]
