By the end of the 10th century,[17] Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus.  The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of Qatran Tabrizi(1009â€“1072) who served in the courts of the Shaddadid and Rawadid dynasties.  Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the "Azerbaijan"[3] or "Trans-Cacausian" school[31] or "Tabriz School"[32] or "Shirvan School"[32] or "Arranian Style"[33][34] of Persian poetry.  This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with "Khurasani" ("Eastern") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of technical terminology and Christian imagery, the presence of Persian[35] archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts.[30]  Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term "'Iraqi" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.[36]
