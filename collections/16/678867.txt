Most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency.[7] "Research administration is all about serviceâ€”service to our faculty, to our academic units, to the institution, and to our sponsors. To be of service, we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations."[8]
