Passing over the river, the route soon re-enters the Reno city limits. McCarran Boulevard travels southerly through established neighborhoods, then turns to the west. The route becomes more commercial again, passing Meadowood Mall as it heads west to South Virginia Street (US 395 Bus.). The state highway then ends at its origin point underneath the I-580/US 395 overpass.
