On 5 May 2011, it was announced that Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole would not return as judges for series 8 in order to concentrate on The X Factor USA.[4] On 14 May 2011, Dannii Minogue announced that she would not appear as a judge on the eighth series either, due to a clash with Australia's Got Talent, another show for which she judges. Of her decision, Minogue said, "During discussions for me to return to The X Factor it became clear that unfortunately, this year, The X Factor audition dates in the UK clash with the live shows of Australia's Got Talent during June and July. For this reason I am unable to return".[5]
