Prior to the series debut, UNICO National formally requested that MTV cancel the show.[101] In a letter to the network, UNICO called the show a "... direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans ..."[102] UNICO National President Andre DiMino said in a statement "MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and green, white and red maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols. They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian-Americans with every technique possible ..."[103] Around this time, other Italian-American organizations joined the fight, including the National Italian American Foundation,[104] the Order Sons of Italy in America and the internet watch-dog ItalianAware.[105][106]
