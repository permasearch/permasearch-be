The sinking of INS Khurki was followed by another attack on Karachi port on the night of 8/9 December 1971 under codename: Python.[19] A squadron of Indian Navy's Osa missile boats approached the Karachi port and launched series of Soviet-acquired Styx missiles that resulted in further destruction of reserve fuel tanks and the sinking of three Pakistani merchant ships as well as foreign ships docked in Karachi.[105] The Pakistan Air Force did not attack the Indian Navy ships and confusion remains the next day when the civilian pilots of Pakistan International, acting as reconnaissance war pilots, misidentified PNSÂ Zulfiqar and the air force attacked its own warship, inflicting major damages to warship and killing several officers on board.[106]
