Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes.[22] The world's largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore.[88] About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc.[89] Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated SHG, and is 99.995% pure.[90]
