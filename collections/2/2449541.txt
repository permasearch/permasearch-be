The US Environmental Protection Agency has done work on a MAC curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane, N2O, and HFCs.[13] Enerdata and LEPII-CNRS (France) produce MAC curves with the Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model for the 6 Kyoto Protocol gases.[14] These curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies [15] or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool.[16]
