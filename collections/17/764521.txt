This type of warfare differed from regular political warfare, as the Flower war was also used for combat training and as first exposure to war for new military members.[5] In addition, regular warfare included the use of long range weapons such as atlatl darts, stones, and sling shots to damage the enemy from afar.[5] During Flower wars, warriors were expected to fight up close and exhibit their combat abilities while aiming to injure the enemy, rather than kill them.[5] The main objective of Aztec Flower warfare was to capture victims alive for use later as human sacrifice, and offerings to the gods. When death occurred from battling in a Flower War, it was considered much more noble than dying in a regular military battle.[5] Additionally, death in the Flower Wars contained religious importance as those who died were thought to live in heaven with the war god, Huitzilopochtli.[6]
