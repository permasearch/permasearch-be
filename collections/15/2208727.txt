The author of the Capitolfax article then went on to say, "I honestly didn’t remember writing that and I couldn’t find it with my site search, either. So, I used Bing and realized that it was a comment, not a post. Turns out, I was trying to calm down a commenter who complained that Rep. Ives 'introduced at least five ALEC model bills this year.'"[10]
