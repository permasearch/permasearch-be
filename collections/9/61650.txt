After their visit to the Raja, the villagers witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an argument with one of the British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province "for three years" if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villages in the province, without their consent. When the other villagers learn about the bet, they are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule.
