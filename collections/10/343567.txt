NSV ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) generally adopt a helical conformation.[8] For nonsegmented NSVs, these conformations are typically linear in fashion, and are relatively rigid.[9][10] Segmented NSVs are present in a more flexible, circular conformation.[11] This results from non-covalent RNA-RNA interactions between the 5’- and 3’-termini of the RNA segments.[12] Regarding the helical character of NSV RNPs, the main determinant of this conformation is the NP/N protein.[8] The structure of virion full-length RNPs are typically presented as a left-handed, double-helical arrangement of two NP strands that are opposite in polarity.[8] Recombinant RNPs have a different structure, generally consisting of a right-handed helix.[13]
