Pilots should not take off or land in the presence of wildlife and should avoid migratory routes,[42] wildlife reserves, estuaries and other sites where birds may congregate. When operating in the presence of bird flocks, pilots should seek to climb above 3,000 feet (910 m) as rapidly as possible as most birdstrikes occur below 3,000 feet (910 m). Additionally, pilots should slow down their aircraft when confronted with birds. The energy that must be dissipated in the collision is approximately the relative kinetic energy (     E  k     {\displaystyle E_{k}}  ) of the bird, defined by the equation      E  k   =   1 2   m  v  2     {\displaystyle E_{k}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}   where     m   {\displaystyle m}   is the mass of the bird and     v   {\displaystyle v}   is the relative velocity (the difference of the velocities of the bird and the plane, resulting in a lower absolute value if they are flying in the same direction and higher absolute value if they are flying in opposite directions). Therefore, the speed of the aircraft is much more important than the size of the bird when it comes to reducing energy transfer in a collision. The same can be said for jet engines: the slower the rotation of the engine, the less energy which will be imparted onto the engine at collision.
