The series played a key role throughout the Clone Saga, becoming one of two Spider-Man titles that shifted focus to the new Ben Reilly Scarlet Spider character with issue #51 (November 1994).[8] The series' run was interrupted by that saga in issues #63 and 64 (Nov.â€“Dec. 1995), when the title was renumbered to #1 and renamed Scarlet Spider. Spider-Man resumed with #65 (Jan. 1996), with Ben Reilly replacing Peter Parker as Spider-Man.
