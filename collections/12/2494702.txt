Britain made Burma a province of India in 1886 with the capital at Rangoon. Traditional Burmese society was drastically altered by the demise of the monarchy and the separation of religion and state.[citation needed] Though war officially ended after only a couple of weeks, resistance continued in northern Burma until 1890, with the British finally resorting to a systematic destruction of villages and appointment of new officials to finally halt all guerrilla activity. The economic nature of society also changed dramatically. After the opening of the Suez Canal, the demand for Burmese rice grew and vast tracts of land were opened up for cultivation. However, to prepare the new land for cultivation, farmers were forced to borrow money from Indian moneylenders called chettiars at high interest rates and were often foreclosed on and evicted losing land and livestock. Most of the jobs also went to indentured Indian labourers, and whole villages became outlawed as they resorted to 'dacoity' (armed robbery).[citation needed] While the Burmese economy grew, all the power and wealth remained in the hands of several British firms, Anglo-Burmese people, and migrants from India.[35] The civil service was largely staffed by the Anglo-Burmese community and Indians, and Bamars were excluded almost entirely from military service. Though the country prospered, the people largely failed to reap the rewards. George Orwell's novel Burmese Days is a fictional account of the British period. Throughout colonial rule, the Anglo-Burmese dominated the country, causing discontent among the local populace.
