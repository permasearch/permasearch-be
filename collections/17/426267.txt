The Enlightenment applied scientific reasoning to politics, science, and religion.  It promoted religious tolerance.  And, it restored literature, arts, and music as important disciplines worthy of study in colleges.  "New-model" American style colleges were founded such as King's College New York (now Columbia University), and the College of Philadelphia (now Penn).  Yale College and the College of William & Mary were reformed.  A non-denominational moral philosophy replaced theology in many college curricula.  Even Puritan colleges such as the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and Harvard University reformed their curricula to include natural philosophy (science), modern astronomy, and mathematics.
