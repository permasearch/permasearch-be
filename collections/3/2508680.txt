"Messin' with the Kid" is an up-tempo twelve-bar blues which alternates between Afro-Cuban- and Little Richard-style rhythmic accompaniment. According to Junior Wells, the title was inspired by his young daughter Gina. Mel London arrived early at Wells' home to pick him up for a scheduled recording session: "'Where's you Daddy at? Get him up'. 'No, you said you were goin' to be here at nine o'clock. It's not nine o'clock.... You're not goin' to be messin' with the kid'".[2] "The Kid" was a nickname for Wells. Later in the studio, they needed another song for the session: "...one thing led to another and ... it took us five minutes, maybe ten minutes and we had it".[2]
