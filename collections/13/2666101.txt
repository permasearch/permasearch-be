Although Rodimus plays the part of the brash youth, he is actually very intelligent, and has no loyalty to Optimus Prime; only his own personal gain. According to his biography, Rodimus used to be leader of the Wreckers, a mercenary group hired by Optimus Prime; but after the deaths of the other members, he joined the Autobot Seekers under the command of Goldbug.
