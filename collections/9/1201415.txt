The L81 was the only 5.7 L (350 cu in) Corvette engine for 1981. It produced 190 bhp and 280 lb-ft of torque from 8.2:1 compression, exactly the same as the 1980 L48, but added hotter cam and computer control spark advance, replacing the vacuum advance.[9] The L81 was unique in that it was the only Corvette engine that employed a "smart carburetor." The Rochester Quadrajet from 1980 was modified to allow electronic mixture control, and an ECM (Engine Control Module), supplied with data from an exhaust oxygen sensor, modified the fuel/air mixture being fed to the engine.
