The typical frontovik during the war was ethnic Russian aged 19–24 whose average height was 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m).[103] Most of the men were shaven bald to prevent lice and the few who did grow their hair kept it very short.[103] The American historian Gordon Rottman described the uniforms as “simple and functional”.[103] In combat, the men wore olive-brown helmets or the pilotka (side cap).[103] Officers wore a shlem or furazhka (peaked cap), a round service hat with a black visor and a red star.[103] Rottman described Soviet weapons as being “...known for their simplicity, ruggedness and general reliability”.[104] The standard rifle was Mosin-Nagant 7.62 mm M 1891/30 rifle, and although heavy, it was an effective weapons that crucially was not affected by the cold.[105] Every rifle section had one or two 7.62 mm Degtyarev DP light machine guns to provide fire support.[106] By 1944, one of every four frontovik was armed with the 7.62 mm PPSh-41 (Pistolet-Pulemet Shapagina-Pistol Automatic Shpagin), a type of submachine gun known as a “rugged and reliable weapon”, if somewhat underpowered.[104]
