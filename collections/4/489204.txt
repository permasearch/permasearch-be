In 1960, MGM dealt with Cinerama to make four films in that process. They were wondering what topic to tackle when Bing Crosby approached them with a proposition. He was developing a television spectacular called How the West Was Won based on photographs of the Old West in Life, with profits to go to St John's Hospital. Rosemary Clooney and he had recorded an album inspired by the same article called How the West Was Won. MGM bought the project from Crosby.[8]
