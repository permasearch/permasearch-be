Now let's consider the situation classically and imagine that the system transited from      |  ψ ⟩   {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }   to      |  φ ⟩   {\displaystyle |\varphi \rangle }   via an intermediate state      |  i ⟩   {\displaystyle |i\rangle }  . Then we would classically expect the probability of the two-step transition to be the sum of all the possible intermediate steps. So we would have
