Kyle Huckabee (28, from New Orleans, Louisiana) and Bajaree Boonma aka Noon (25, from Bangkok, Thailand) met online through Facebook while he was doing research for a trip to Thailand. The two met in person while he was there on vacation. They were engaged and Noon came to America even though Kyle hadn't officially proposed. They initially lived in Kyle's bachelor apartment with his roommate, but the situation was less than ideal. Kyle started working extra shifts at his job as a bartender on Bourbon Street so that they could afford an apartment of their own. Kyle proposed during a parachuting trip, and they moved into a new apartment. Before he met Noon, Kyle was estranged from his parents who are divorced. With Noon's support, he restarted the relationship with his mother. Kyle & Noon were married in a Buddhist temple, but unfortunately, Noon's family was unable to attend the ceremony. Kyleâ€™s mom chose not to attend. They are still married.
