This section is exposed to incoming water to help a cooling system of the engine in the torpedo. It has a starter, a Chowaki or pressure regulator, a wet-heat chamber, a main engine, and a horizontal rudder controller. The starter starts controllers, one for vertical tail rudders, and another for roll rudders for anti-rolling in both side wing rudders, with horizontal tail rudders being locked at uppermost position, while the torpedo falls down to the water surface. It starts the main engine to propel when the torpedo hits the water. A thick safety bolt is inserted into the starter when the weapon is loaded on an aircraft. The bolt is pulled out from the torpedo when it is released. The bolt remains underneath the fuselage of aircraft.[citation needed]
