The ISRO is in the process of conducting conceptual studies that could take up to two years before deciding on a plan to send a spacecraft to Jupiter or Venus. The ideal launch window to send a spacecraft to Jupiter occurs every 33 months. If the missions occur, a visit to both planets would happen simultaneously. Venus would be visited first, then Jupiter. It would take a little over 3 months to go to Venus, and would take 23 months to travel from Earth to the Jovian orbit.[97]
