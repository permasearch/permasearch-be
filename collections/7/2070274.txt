Civilians, including large numbers of children, have been regularly forced into labor, especially as miners and soldiers. Many miners become enslaved when they fail to pay back debt to their employer.[80] Rebel and militia groups commit widespread human rights abuses, including rape, enslavement, torture, disappearances and killing of civilians.[81] These groups compete for finances from illegal mining.[82] Reports indicate that corporations have facilitated these abuses by obtaining minerals from areas controlled by these groups.[79] Sexual violence is an especially widespread and devastating issue across the country. Between 1.69 and 1.80 million women reported being raped in their lifetime.[81] Around mines, survival prostitution, sex slavery, and forced child prostitution have been observed.[79] This widespread sexual violence contributes to the spread of HIV/AIDS, as well.[83]
