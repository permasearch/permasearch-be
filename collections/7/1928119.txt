Part of a joint venture with Hyundai Motors that began in 2002, a Chinese company, Hawtai Motor, manufactured the first-generation Santa Fe.[6] While it did make Hyundai-branded models for sale on the Chinese market,[6] one of the versions it debuted under its own brand name in 2009 was the Santa Fe C9.[7] Utilizing a Rover-acquired engine, it may have been priced at a significant discount to those bearing the Hyundai name.[8]
