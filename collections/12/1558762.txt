The Kamiokande II detection, which at 12 neutrinos had the largest sample population, showed that the neutrinos arrived in two distinct pulses. The first pulse, which started at 07:35:35 comprised 9 neutrinos, all of which arrived over a period of 1.915 seconds. A second pulse of three neutrinos arrived between 9.219 and 12.439 seconds after the first neutrino was detected, for a pulse duration of 3.220 seconds.
