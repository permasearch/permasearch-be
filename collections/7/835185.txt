The Spanish lyrics of Bayan Ko were originally written for the Severino Reyes zarzuela, Walang Sugat ("no wound"). Attributed to the propagandista, General José Alejandrino, the song expressed opposition to the ongoing American Occupation.[1] The current and more popular Tagalog version is attributed to José Corazón de Jesús, and the music to Constancio de Guzmán.
