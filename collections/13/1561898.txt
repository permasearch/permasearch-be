The next day, the rest of Smith's men arrived at the mission, and that night the head of the garrison at the mission confiscated all their guns.[58] On December 8, Smith was summoned to San Diego for an interview with Governor José María Echeandía about his party's status in the country.[59][l] Echeandía, surprised and suspicious of the Americans unauthorized entrance into California, had Smith arrested, believing him to be a spy. [60] Accompanied by Abraham LaPlant, Smith's Spanish interpreter, Smith was taken to San Diego, while the rest of the party remained at the mission. Echeandía detained Smith for about two weeks, demanding that he turn over his journal and maps. Smith asked for permission to travel north to the Columbia River on a coastal route, where known paths could take his party back to United States territory. Upon intercession of American sea Captain W.H. Cunningham of Boston on the ship, Courier, Smith was finally released by Echeandía to reunite with his men.[4] Echeandía ordered Smith and his party to leave California by the same route they entered, forbidding him to travel up the coast to Bodega, but giving Smith permission to purchase needed supplies for an eastern overland return journey.[61][4][62] Smith boarded the Courier sailing from San Diego to San Pedro, to meet his men.[63]
