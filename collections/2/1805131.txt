In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the "Miner's Friend",[5] essentially identical to Somerset's design and almost certainly a direct copy. The process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow, so Savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam.
