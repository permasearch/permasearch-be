In 2018, Manly were fined $750,000 and two of the club's officials received 12 month bans after The NRL found that they had breached the salary cap over the previous five seasons.  The breaches involve 15 players over five years, totalling $1.5 million.  Unlike Parramatta and other teams who have breached the salary cap, Manly did not receive any competition points deduction.[19]
