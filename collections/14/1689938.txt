The second dancing show was Bailando por un sueño (Dancing for a Dream) in 2008, based on a Mexican reality show with the same name, broadcast on Panamericana Televisión, but produced by a different production: GV Producciones. This show was hosted by Gisela Valcárcel and Giancarlo Chichizola and aired every Saturday night (from June to December). The show was like Dancing With The Stars, but instead of professional dancers, there were amateur dancers. They danced every week in order to win a prize: to achieve a personal/humanitarian goal or "dream". The show had 2 series and the 4 first places of each series had the chance to dance on Reyes de la Pista.
