The Soviet Union continued to extend their lead in the space race with their mission on April 12, 1961 which made soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin the first human being to leave Earth's atmosphere and enter space. The United States gained some ground a month later, on May 15, 1961, when they sent Alan Shepard on a fifteen-minute flight outside of Earth's atmosphere during the Freedom 7 project. On February 20, 1962, America made further progress as John Glenn became the first American to orbit around all of Earth in one of their Mercury programs, Friendship 7.[15]
