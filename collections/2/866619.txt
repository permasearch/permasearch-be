Men and women took their meals separately.[19] When the house was too small, the men ate first, the women afterwards.[20] Slaves waited at dinners. Aristotle notes that "the poor, having no slaves, would ask their wives or children to serve food." Respect for the father who was the breadwinner was obvious.[21]
