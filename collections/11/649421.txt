A David Eyre's pancake is a variation on the Dutch baby pancake named after the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912â€“2008). The recipe was published by New York Times Food Editor Craig Claiborne in an April 10, 1966, Times article entitled "Pancake Nonpareil"; in addition to generally regularizing quantities and temperatures for modern use, it omitted sugar and salt from the batter.[7]. In it, Claiborne recounted discovering the dish at a breakfast prepared by Eyre, then the editor of Honolulu Magazine, while Claiborne was visiting Eyre's Honolulu home.[8]
