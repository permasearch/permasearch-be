The king could be appointed only with the concurrence of the patra mantris (council of ministers—Burhagohain, Borgohain, Borpatrogohain, Borbarua and Borphukan).  During three periods in the 14th century, the kingdom had no kings when acceptable candidates were not found.  The ministers could remove unacceptable kings, and it used to involve executing the erstwhile king.  In the 17th century a power struggle and the increasing number of claimants to the throne resulted in kings being deposed in quick succession, all of whom were executed after the new king was instated.  To prevent this bloody end, a new rule was introduced during the reign of Sulikphaa Lora Roja—claimants to the throne had to be physically unblemished—which meant that threats to the throne could be removed by merely slitting the ear of an ambitious prince.  Rudra Sinha, suspecting his brother Lechai's intention, mutilated and banished him.  The problem of succession remained, and on his deathbed he instructed that all his sons were to become kings.  One of his sons, Mohanmala, was superseded, who went on to lead a rebel group during the Moamoria rebellion.  The later kings and officers exploited the unblemished rule, leading to weak kings being instated.  Kamaleswar Singha (2-year-old son of Kadam Dighala) and Purandar Singha (10-year-old son of Brajanath and one of the last kings of this dynasty) came into office because their fathers were mutilated.
