The UK government established several incentives for E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a Â£ 10 to 15 reduction in the vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars.[124] Despite the small number of E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations,[123][124] most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006.[141] Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70.[142] Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel,[143] and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.[144]
