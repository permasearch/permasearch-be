In China the age of consent for sexual activity is 14 years, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.[15] Chinese law defines statutory rape as having sex with a girl who is less than fourteen years of age. A five-year prison sentence and fine may result if the girl under 14 years of age was acting as a prostitute.[16] On August 2015, the law concerning underage prostitutes was repealed. The Statutory rape law now applies to underage prostitution as well.[17]
