The President of the United States ("a Bill Clinton look-alike") makes a visit to Rigby's during a stop in Chicago. While walking through the store, he falls prey to a toppling display of orange soda cans that the boys have erected. Saved from disaster by Kenan, Bill tells him to drop by the White House as his special guest if he's ever in town. The boys take him up on his offer and wreak havoc at the White House.
