A domestic treble consists of a club winning three of their country's competitions (top-tier league, cup, league cup, etc), all during one season. Many countries do not have a third domestic competition (such as a League Cup), besides competitions consisting of a single match or a two-leg match (e.g. Supercups), so achieving a domestic treble is impossible (modern examples include Germany and Italy).
