One of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism. Tourism and photography combine to create a "tourist gaze"[53] in which local inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens. However, it has also been argued that there exists a "reverse gaze"[54] through which indigenous photographees can position the tourist photographer as a shallow consumer of images.
