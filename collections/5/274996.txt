At the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams.[33] Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association.[34] Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for "Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.".[35] In contrast, each individual team (except the non-profit Green Bay Packers[36]) is subject to tax because they make a profit.[37]
