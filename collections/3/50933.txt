Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population. For example, the 1831 census only counted men and did not cover the whole empire.[67][167] For earlier periods estimates of size and distribution of the population are based on observed demographic patterns.[169]
