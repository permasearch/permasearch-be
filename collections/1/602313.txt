By the 1940s, grape farming had declined due to fungal diseases, and it was replaced by citrus farming. Citrus plantations flourished on the flanks of Sugarloaf Mountain, providing the basis for the local economy until the 1980s, when freezes began to systematically devastate local groves. As the citrus industry faded, property on the mountain was rezoned for residential development, with value seen in the mountain's panoramic views of the surrounding area.[5][7] Other lands abutting the mountain, primarily along Lake Apopka, were preserved with the intention of restoring long absent ecologies.[5][8][9] Only a few citrus plantations and vineyards managed to persist to the present day.
