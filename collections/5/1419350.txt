The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le贸n, first Governor of Puerto Rico. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de Le贸n was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now Florida in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de Le贸n was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.
