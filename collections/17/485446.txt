Wanting to bait Oliver, Noah insults the memory of Oliver's mother, calling her "a regular right-down bad 'un". Enraged, Oliver assaults the much bigger boy. Mrs Sowerberry takes Noah's side, helps him to subdue, punch, and beat Oliver, and later compels her husband and Mr Bumble, who has been sent for in the aftermath of the fight, to beat Oliver once again. Once Oliver is sent to his room for the night, he breaks down and weeps. The next day, Oliver escapes from the Sowerberrys' house and later decides to run away to London to seek a better life.
