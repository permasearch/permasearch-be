Paramore has expressed appreciation for Fall Out Boy, Hanson, Panic! at the Disco, Blink-182, Death Cab for Cutie, Jimmy Eat World, MewithoutYou, and Sunny Day Real Estate,[138] as well as Thrice and New Found Glory;[139] Hayley Williams has cited her personal influences as Elvis Presley, the Shirelles, the Angels, the Ramones, Blondie,[140] Aaliyah,[141] Robert Smith of The Cure and Etta James.[142] Williams named many singers as heroines: "I love Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux. I grew up listening to The Distillers [...] Girl groups are really important to me, but the Shangri-Las especially".[143] Williams also explained that bands such as U2, "who are massive, and do whatever they want, write whatever they want and they stand for something," Jimmy Eat World, "who I donâ€™t think ever disappoint their fans," and No Doubt, who "have done amazing things," act as a pattern for the path in which Paramore would like to take their career.[138] In 2012, Williams contributed vocals to MewithoutYou's fifth studio album, Ten Stories.[144]
