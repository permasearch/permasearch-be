Meanwhile, critics lauded the character's relationship and chemistry with Rapunzel enthusiastically, likening it to that of a romantic comedy. Writing for the Mountain Xpress, Ken Hanke felt that "what works best is the interplay between the two leads", concluding, "these animated characters are frankly more believable and charismatic than the human ones in ... Love and Other Drugs."[67] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the characters' "relationship is built on mutual respect and trust, something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies."[68] The Miami Herald's Rene Rodriquez opined, "Even though they may seem to be boilerplate fairy-tale heroes, you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together,"[69] while Joe Neumaier of the Daily News simply called their relationship "cute".[70] Ted Fry of The Seattle Times wrote, "The back-and-forth banter of what inevitably becomes a courtship is consistently witty and given extra sparkle from adroit characterizations by Moore and Levi."[71] Similarly, Cathy Jakicic, writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, opined, "Moore and Levi, meanwhile, breathe new life into the classic love-hate romance."[72] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune felt that both "characters are equally strong and funny".[36] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the characters' relationship makes the film "engaging".[73] BuzzFeed author Arielle Calderon compiled "19 Reasons Rapunzel And Flynn Rider Are The Best Disney Couple", citing their meeting and opposite personalities among them.[74] Babble.com ranked Flynn and Rapunzel among the "Top 10 Cutest Disney Couples".[75]
