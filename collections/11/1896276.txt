During the later Colonial years, forfeiture practices by the Crown officials using writs of assistance were one of the many activities that angered colonists, who saw the writs as "unreasonable searches and seizures" which deprived persons of "life, liberty, or property, without due process."[8] The early Congress wrote forfeiture laws based on British maritime law to help federal tax collectors collect customs duties, which financed most of the expenses of the federal government in the early days of the republic.[7] Seizures allowed government to confiscate property from citizens who failed to pay taxes or customs duties.[6] The Supreme Court upheld these forfeiture statutes in situations where it was virtually impossible to get hold of guilty persons on the high seas while possible to get hold of their property.[7] During much of the 19th century there was not much attention paid to forfeiture laws.[7]
