The freshwater pearl mussel, which is completely protected in all European countries,[32][33] has been the focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts.[34] Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct,[34][35] the culture of juvenile mussels, and the release of juvenile trout, which have been infected with glochidia, into small rivers, but mainly the freshwater pearl mussel has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas.[35] Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater pearl mussel, the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel.[9]
