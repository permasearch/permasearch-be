In 2005, experiments were conducted on the ability of capuchins to use money.[25] After several months of training, the monkeys began exhibiting behaviors considered to reflect understanding of the concept of a medium of exchange that were previously believed to be restricted to humans (such as responding rationally to price shocks).[25] They showed the same propensity to avoid perceived losses demonstrated by human subjects and investors. They also may trade sex for money.[26]
