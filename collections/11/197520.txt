The King's bedchamber had originally been the State Drawing Room and had been used by Queen Marie-Theresa, but after her death in 1701 Louis XIV took it over to use as his own bedroom.  Louis IV died in the room on September 15, 1751.  Both Louis XV and Louis XVI continued to use the bedroom for their official awakening and going to bed.  On October 6, 1789, from the balcony of this room Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, joined by the Marquis de Lafayette, looked down on the hostile crowd in the courtyard, shortly before he was forced to return to Paris.[44]
