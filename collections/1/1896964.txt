Basava refers to the Śruti (Vedas) as the foundation of his beliefs, but also states that the Vedas are texts, nature is just nature, and neither is God. He, state Velcheru Rao and Gene Roghair, in Chapter 6 of Basava Purana asserts, "Śruti says, Rudra is the only one; why even consider the other views. How can you say that the Veda is God? If it were true, how could it have been stolen by Somaka? If water is God, how can you account for its tendency to fall down, and how can it be contained in the palm of a person's hand? If fire is God, how is it that it can be extinguished, and how can it eat all kinds of things indiscriminately?"[26]
