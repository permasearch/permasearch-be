This is a list of the 100 verified oldest men, arranged in descending order of each individual's age in years and days. A year typically refers to a calendar year, the time between two dates of the same name. However, years can be of different lengths due to the presence or absence of a leap day within the year, or to the conversion of dates from one calendar to another. The oldest man ever whose age has been verified is Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) of Japan who died at age 116 years, 54 days. There are four living people on this list, the oldest of whom is Francisco Núñez Olivera, aged 7004412300000000000♠112 years, 322 days.
