Parker Jonas is the son of Daniel Jonas and Chloe Lane, although Philip Kiriakis was long thought to be his father. He was born on November 11, 2010 in the Horton cabin after his mother Chloe Lane goes into premature labor. There are complications with the birth (the umbilical cord is wrapped around his neck), and Chloe is assisted by Parker's assumed older sister Melanie. Philip and Daniel later show up, just as Parker is born. Chloe and Daniel go to the hospital and name him Parker Jonas, after Daniel's mother. While Daniel was initially assumed to be the baby's father, it was later revealed (incorrectly) that Parker was conceived during a one-night stand between Chloe and Philip. When Chloe takes a paternity test, the results are changed by Caroline Brady to make her believe that Daniel is the father. When the assumed truth about Parker's paternity was revealed, Daniel left Chloe. On March 2, 2011 Philip became Parker's legal father and Parker's last name was changed to Kiriakis. On January 7, 2013, Chloe returned to Salem and informed Daniel that he was in fact Parker's biological father.
