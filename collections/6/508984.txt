In India, a lieutenant governor is in charge of a union territory. However, the rank is present only in the union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi and Puducherry (the other territories have an administrator appointed, who is an IAS officer or retired judges of courts ). However, the governor of Punjab acts as the administrator of Chandigarh. Although lieutenant-governors do not hold the same rank as a governor of a state in the list of precedence.
