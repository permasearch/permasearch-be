The music for Plan 9 from Outer Space was compiled by Gordon Zahler. Zahler used stock recordings of works by about a dozen composers, which was a fairly common procedure in the 1950s for scoring low-budget films and television programs. However, Zahler apparently never provided a reliable accounting for the score.[12] In 1996, Paul Mandell produced a CD that recreated the film's score by tracking down the stock recordings and the composers;[13] Mandell subsequently wrote an article about the film's music for Film Score Monthly.[14] Some websites give proper credit to these composers.[15]
