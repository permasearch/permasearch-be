Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States  War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing[34] and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear.[35] To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare midriffs.[36] The fabric shortage continued for some time after the end of the war.
