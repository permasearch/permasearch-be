Primary progressive MS occurs in approximately 10â€“20% of individuals, with no remission after the initial symptoms.[4][59] It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements.[10] The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype. It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.[5]
