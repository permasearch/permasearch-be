After the end of his eight season at Real Madrid, Ronaldo had already amassed a total of 406 goals, making him the top scorer in the club's history. Former Real manager José Mourinho referred to him as a "goalscoring machine."[63] He holds the record for most goals in a single Champions League season, after scoring a total of 17 goals in 2013–14. This tally included one from a penalty kick in the final as the club won La Decima,[64] where he became the first player to score for two different teams in Champions League finals.[65][66] He is also alongside Messi the only player to score seven Champions League hat-tricks as well as the only player to score a Champions League hat-trick in consecutive matches. In December 2014, Ronaldo became the fastest player to score 200 goals in La Liga when, in his 178th La Liga game, he scored a hat-trick against Celta Vigo; his 23rd hat-trick was also a La Liga record.[67]
