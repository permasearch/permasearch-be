A typical day for the student-athlete at Bradenton consists of academic classes in the morning followed by sports training in the afternoon.  Students at the academy take accelerated courses and graduate high school a year early, making the players who do not turn pro immediately some of the most heavily recruited prospects in college soccer. The academy can trace its roots back to Project 2010 which highlighted ways U.S. Soccer could make the senior men's national team a legitimate threat to win the World Cup by the end of the decade.  Two programs that were born from Project 2010 were Generation Adidas (previously called Project-40) and the Bradenton academy.  The academy was started in January 1999 with the backing of IMG and Nike, but will be closed in 2017 due to the proliferation of U.S. Development Academy programs.[16]
