In what was seen as a rebuilding year, given the departures of All Americans Deja McClendon, Katie Slay and Ariel Scott, Penn State’s success and 36–3 overall record was largely attributed to the performance of its highly touted freshmen, Ali Frantti (AVCA National Freshman of the Year and AVCA Second Team All American), who led the team with 391 kills, Haleigh Washington (Big Ten Freshman of the Year), who paced the team with a .463 hitting percentage, and Simone Lee, who had 135 kills and contributed significantly in Penn State’s wins over Wisconsin during the regular season and the NCAA tournament.  Aiyana Whitney, the junior outside hitter and AVCA Second Team All American, was also a pivotal piece of Penn State's championship team – accumulating 372 kills on .353 hitting.  With Grant, Frantti, Whitney, Washington, Courtney and Lee, Penn State had one of the most balanced attacks in the nation and led the NCAA in hitting.
