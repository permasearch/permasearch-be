Similar to what they had done with other social issues and in developing their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it.  The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion.  The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise.  We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard".[13]  The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death.  They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death.[9]  They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all".[10]  Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers.[9]
