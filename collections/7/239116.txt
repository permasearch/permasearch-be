In 2002, Krispy Kreme opened its second store in New England in Newington, Connecticut. What followed was a period of aggressive expansion throughout the region; this included a Krispy Kreme at the Prudential Center in Boston, Massachusetts, which opened on April 15, 2004 and closed sixteen months later. Initially fueled by hype surrounding the opening of Krispy Kreme in New England, this regional expansion was followed by the closing of all but one store, at the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville. In January 2010 the Milford store, the first to open in the region, closed after a long decline in patronage. Some say that Krispy Kreme's coffee "left many locals unimpressed, a mortal sin in the joe-loving Hub."[33]
