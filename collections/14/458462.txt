Lester Crest is a business partner of Michael and Trevor. He is portrayed by Jay Klaitz.[40] Lester worked with Michael and Trevor on many of their heists prior to the heist gone wrong. Following this, Lester kept knowledge on the two, knowing both of their locations. When Michael realises that he needs more money, he contacts Lester,[41][42] who helps him on most of the following heists in the game.[28][29] Lester tends to show anger towards people for no particular reason, often shouting at people and looking down on them as of inferior intelligence than himself. He suffers from wasting disease, which has rendered him unable to walk without a cane.[43] He also knows how to hack into computers for heists, and shows a hatred of white-collar criminals and powerful CEOs who use legitimate businesses to rip off unsuspecting citizens and thus hires Michael and Franklin to kill several powerful businessmen, destroying their companies while he reaps the rewards from buying stocks in their competitors. Several of these businesspeople include Jay Norris, the founder of social media company Lifeinvader, Brett Lowrey, the head of Bilkington Research Corporation, Jackson Skinner, the director of product development of phone company Facade, and Enzo Bonelli, a corrupt real estate construction developer and former mafia boss leader.
