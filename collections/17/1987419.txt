In January 2015, Pandiraj tweeted about his annoyance at Kuralarasan's delay in providing the film's music and stated that a planned teaser scheduled for the month had to be delayed.[19] The director and music composer later exchanged tweets blaming each other for the slow progress of the film.[20][21] T. Rajendar also submitted a complaint to the Nadigar Sangam during September 2015 remarking that Nayantara was refusing to take part in the shoot of a song. Pandiraj came to her defence, arguing that Nayantara had wasted almost two years on the film due to the producers' poor organisation and was still yet to be paid for her work. He further stated that the song in question was an extra "kuthu" number that the script did not warrant and that Rajender, Kuralarasan and Silambarasan were unnecessarily interested in making sure that the song was included against Pandiraj's wishes.[22] Silambarasan later shot the song with Adah Sharma during early March 2016, after the actress was given a further small character in the film.[23]
