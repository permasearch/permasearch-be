The lyric has been considered an exemplar of the songwriting strategy in which lines are not repeated in either the verses or chorus.[7] The Texas, bluegrass-flavored arrangement[1] in the recording begins with a fiddle riff, with the band soon joining in. Verses are sung by Natalie Maines by herself, with drums, fiddle, and soft guitar and piano carrying the accompaniment. Choruses feature sisters Emily Erwin and Martie Seidel backing Maines with harmony vocals, and also add a banjo line. The instrumental break features Erwin and Seidel on mandolin and fiddle respectively. The main fiddle riff then brings the recording to a close.
