As the living embodiment of the Crown, the sovereign is regarded as the personification, or legal personality, of the New Zealand state,[13] with the state therefore referred to as Her Majesty The Queen in Right of New Zealand,[n 4][29] or The Crown.[30] As such, the monarch is the employer of all government staff (including the viceroys, judges, members of the Defence Force, police officers, and parliamentarians), as well as the owner of all state lands (Crown land), buildings and equipment (Crown held property), state-owned companies and agencies (Crown entities),[31] and the copyright for all government publications (Crown copyright). All such property is held by the Crown in perpetuity and cannot be sold by the sovereign without the proper advice and consent of ministers.[citation needed]
