This season, Chris Brancato replaces Walon Green as show runner/executive producer. Green was show runner/EP throughout seasons 8 and 9.[11] Former show runner/executive producer Warren Leight wrote the episode "Trophy Wine", along with all the scenes with D'Onofrio and Julia Ormond, and the final scenes in the finale, "To the Boy In the Blue Knit Cap". Co-creator, developer, and former show runner/EP Ren√© Balcer re-wrote the finale as well, but went uncredited.[12] Brancato suggested that the show could be picked up for an 11th season if the intended final episodes garner sufficient ratings.[13]
