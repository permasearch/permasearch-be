Despite Kouhei's best efforts, he's unable to convince Nekoko to get off drugs. Drugged, she climbs a tree and tries to reach the home of the fairies alone. Months pass, and there is still no sign of Nekoko. The police investigate and question Kouhei a few times, but to no avail as Kouhei has no new information. One day, when he's out shopping he recognizes a familiar voice in the crowd, and manages to catch a glimpse of Nekoko. Nekoko soon vanishes leaving Kouhei to wonder if seeing her was just a dream.
