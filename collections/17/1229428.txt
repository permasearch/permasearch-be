The threat of a terrorist attack on the United States was made clear during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 9/11 hijacking attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Virginia. Since that time, the Department of Homeland Security has been the primary agency to deal with terrorist attack threats towards the United States.
