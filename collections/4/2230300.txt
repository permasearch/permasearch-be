Sixty-year-old Crawford had been reluctant to volunteer, but he did so at the request of General Irvine.[32] Williamson, although popular with the militia, was in disfavor with regular army officers such as Irvine because he had allowed the Gnadenh√ºtten massacre.[33] Hoping to avoid a repetition, Irvine made it known that he favored Crawford's election as commander.[34] The election, which was acrimonious,[14] ended in a close vote: Crawford received 235 votes to Williamson's 230. Colonel Crawford took command, and Williamson became second-in-command with the rank of major.[35] The other majors included John B. McClelland, Thomas Gaddis,[36] and either James Brenton[1] or Joseph Brinton.[2]
