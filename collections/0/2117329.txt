The game of Cribbage appears to have developed in the early 17th century, as an adaptation of the earlier card game Noddy. Pinochle was likely derived from the earlier Bezique, a game popular in France during the 17th century. 1742 saw the publication of Edmund Hoyle's 'Short Treatise on the Game of Whist' which became one of the bestselling publications of the 18th century.[57] Whist was widely played during the 18th and 19th centuries,[58] having evolved from the 16th century game of Trump (or Ruff) by way of Ruff and Honours.[59][60]
