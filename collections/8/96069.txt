It was a few years before an official programme for the Fringe was created. John Menzies compiled a list of shows under the title "Other Events" in their omnibus festival brochure, but it was printer C.J. Cousland who was the first to publish a listings guide, in 1954.[10] This was funded by participating companies and was entitled "Additional Entertainments", since the name "Fringe" was still not yet in regular usage. It also used a strange cover motif.[10]
