In December 2009, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), operator of the Top 14, announced it would impose a cap of €8 million, effective with the 2010–11 season.[56] Previously, the only restrictions on team salaries were that wage bills were limited to 50% of turnover[57] and that 10% of the salary budget had to be held in reserve.[56] Along with the announcement of the cap, LNR also declared that the reserve requirement would be raised to 20%,[56] with the previous limitation of 50% of turnover remaining in effect.[57]
