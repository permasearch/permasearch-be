Central banks can directly control the money supply by placing limits on the amount banks can lend to various sectors of the economy.[37][38] Central banks can also control the amount of lending by applying credit quotas. This allows the central bank to control both the quantity of lending and its allocation towards certain strategic sectors of the economy, for example to support the national industrial policy. The Bank of Japan used to apply such policy ("window guidance") between 1962 and 1991.[39][40]
