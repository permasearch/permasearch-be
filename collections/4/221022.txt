On February 11, 2011, RCI announced that it had ordered the first of a new class of ships from the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, scheduled to be delivered by Fall 2014. At the time, the project was code-named "Project Sunshine".[12] Later that year, two 20.5-megawatt ABB Azipod XO propulsion units were ordered for that ship.[8] On February 29, 2012 the company announced that a second "Project Sunshine" ship had been ordered and would be delivered by Spring 2015,[13] and ordered identical Azipod propulsion units shortly thereafter.[8] Just under a year later, on January 31, 2013, steel cutting for the first ship began with a silhouette of the ship being cut by lasers. The same day, RCI announced the official name of the new class of ships, Quantum Class, as well as the names of the first two ships in the class, Quantum of the Seas and Anthem of the Seas.[1][14] Details on the major features of Quantum of the Seas were announced on April 16, 2013.[15]
