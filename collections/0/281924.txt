Traditional symbols of Roman civilization were utilized by the Fascists, particularly the fasces that symbolized unity, authority and the exercise of power.[67] Other traditional symbols of ancient Rome used by the Fascists included the she-wolf of Rome.[67] The fasces and the she-wolf symbolized the shared Roman heritage of all the regions that constituted the Italian nation.[67] In 1926, the fasces was adopted by the Fascist government of Italy as a symbol of the state.[68] In that year, the Fascist government attempted to have the Italian national flag redesigned to incorporate the fasces on it.[68] However, this attempt to incorporate the fasces on the flag was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists.[68] Afterwards, the Fascist government in public ceremonies rose the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag.[69] However, years later and after Mussolini was forced from power by the King in 1943 only to be rescued by German forces, the Italian Social Republic founded by Mussolini and the Fascists did incorporate the fasces on the state's war flag, which was a variant of the Italian tricolour national flag.
