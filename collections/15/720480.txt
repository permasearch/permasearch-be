Dementia is present, but does not always appear early on with DLB, and is more likely to present as the condition progresses[1][9]—typically after age 55.[4]  According to the 2017 Fourth Consensus Report of the DLB Consortium, dementia is diagnosed when there is a "progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social or occupational functions, or with usual daily activities".[1]
