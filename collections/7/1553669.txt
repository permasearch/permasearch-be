Montgomery underwent several periods of depression while trying to cope with the duties of motherhood and church life and with her husbandâ€™s attacks of religious melancholia (endogenous major depressive disorder) and deteriorating health: "For a woman who had given the world so much joy, life was mostly an unhappy one."[11] In 1918, Montgomery was stricken with and was almost killed by the "Spanish Flu" pandemic that killed between 50-100 million people all over the world in 1918-1919, spending ten days bed-ridden with the Spanish flu.[35] Despite its name, the "Spanish flu" came from China, being spread by Chinese workers taken to dig trenches in Western Europe in World War I. In her diary on 1 December 1918, Montgomery wrote after a visit to Toronto in November: "Toronto was then beginning to be panic stricken over the outbreak of the terrible "Spanish flu". The drug counters were besieged with frantic people seeking remedies and safeguards".[51] Montgomery wrote in her diary about being infected with Spanish flu: "I was in bed for ten days. I never felt so sick or weak in my life", going on to express thanks to God and her friends for helping her survive the ordeal.[52] Montgomery's best friend Frederica Campbell MacFaralane was not so lucky and died after contacting the Spanish flu on 20 January 1919.[35] Montgomery was upset that her husband had been indifferent to her as she was dying of the Spanish flu, which drove her to think about divorce (something very difficult to obtain in Canada until 1967-between 1873 and 1901, there only 263 divorces out a population of six million).[53] Ultimately, Montgomery decided it was her Christian duty to make her marriage work.[53] After the First World War, a recurring character in Montgomery's journal that was to obsess her for the rest of her life was "the Piper", who at first appeared as a heroic Highlander piper from Scotland, leading men into battle while playing traditional Highland tunes, but who turned out to be the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a trickster taking children away from their parents forever.[54] The figure of "the Piper" reflected Montgomery's own disillusionment with World War One and her guilt at her ardent support for the war.[55] To inspire men to volunteer for the war, a piper had marched through the center of Leaskdale daily, playing Highland war tunes, which had given Montgomery the basis of the figure of "the Piper".[56] "The piper" first appears in the Anne books in Rainbow Valley (1919), inspiring the men of Avonlea with his courage.[57] In Rilla of Ingleside (1921), "the Piper" returns as a more sinister figure, inspiring Anne's son Walter to enlist in the Canadian expeditionary force, while taking on the appearance and personality of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.[58]
