In March 2017, Ken Barlow is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant in a storyline dubbed Who Attacked Ken?. The main suspects were Ken's children Peter, Tracy and Daniel Osbourne, his grandchildren Amy and Adam Barlow, local builder and soap villain Pat Phelan and Daniel's girlfriend Sinead Tinker. The attacker was revealed in May 2017 to be Daniel. Daniel was offered a place at Oxford University. However, Sinead falls pregnant with his child and he decides to stay in Weatherfield to look after them. When Ken learns of this, he persuades Sinead to get an abortion. When Sinead reveals to Daniel about the abortion, he breaks up with Sinead and attacks Ken that night. Daniel is not arrested as Ken tells the police that he tripped and no one pushed him.
