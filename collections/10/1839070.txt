Manuscript C is a notebook written for the prioress of the Carmel Reverend Mother Marie de Gonzague. It was begun on June 3, 1897, and finished early in July 1897. The origin of the third part of the autobiography of Thérèse has been described by Pauline: "It seemed to me that these accounts were incomplete. Sister Thérèse of the Child Jesus had concentrated on her childhood and early youth as I had asked her to do; her life as a nun was hardly sketched in. ...I thought it a great pity that she had not described the development of her life in the Carmel in the same way, but just then I had ceased to be Reverend Mother and Mother Marie de Gonzague held this office. ...Seeing that Sister Thérèse was so ill ... about midnight on the evening of the June 2, 1897, ... I went to see Mother Prioress."[5] Pauline asked the Prioress to order Thérèse to write about her life as a religious and the next morning Marie de Gonzague did so, so that Thérèse went on with her account. Most of this manuscript was written during the month of June, 1897. Thérèse stopped writing in the first days of July, 1897. "Eventually the pencil fell from her hand as she wrote the last word, love. It is the final word of all three manuscripts."[6]
