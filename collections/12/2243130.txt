In 1680, George Dalgarno published Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor,[10] in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;[11] some have speculated that they can be traced to early Ogham manual alphabets.[12][13]
