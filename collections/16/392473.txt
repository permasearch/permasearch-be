The connection between death and eroticism is probably ancient in Scandinavia, and to this testify numerous "white stones", great phallic stones that were raised on the barrows. The tradition goes back to the 5th century, and in total 40 such stones have been discovered, and mostly on Norway's south-western coast. It is possible that death required an extra portion of fertility and eroticism, but also that the living received life force from the dead. The thought may be that life and death have the same origin and if an individual died, the fertility and the future life of the clan would be ensured.[9]
