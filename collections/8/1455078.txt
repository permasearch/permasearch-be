The North Bank was the final stand to be refurbished. It opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million.[19] The rework significantly reduced the stadium's capacity, from 57,000 at the beginning of the decade to under 40,000.[20] High ticket prices to serve the club's existing debts and low attendance figures forced Arsenal to explore the possibility of building a larger stadium in 1997. The club wanted to attract an evergrowing fanbase and financially compete with the biggest clubs in England.[20][21] By comparison, Manchester United enjoyed a rise in gate receipts; the club went from £43.9 million in 1994 to £87.9 million in 1997 because of Old Trafford's expansion.[22]
