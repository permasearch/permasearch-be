Reminders of the long-gone bridge railway survive along the south side of the lower Yerba Buena Tunnel. These are the regularly spaced "deadman holes", escape alcoves common in all railway tunnels, along the wall, into which track workers could duck if a train came along. (The north side, which always carried only motor traffic, lacks these holes.)[citation needed][30]
