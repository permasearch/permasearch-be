It was not until the Tudors, specifically the reign of Henry VIII (1509â€“47), that crown control started to once again extend throughout Ireland.[4] Having declared himself King of Ireland in 1541, Henry VIII went about converting Irish chiefs into feudal subjects of the crown with land divided into districts, which were eventually amalgamated into the modern counties.[4] County boundaries were still ill-defined; however, in 1543 Meath was split into Meath and Westmeath.[4] Around 1545, the Byrnes and O'Tooles, both native septs who had constantly been a pain for the English administration of the Pale, petitioned the Lord Deputy of Ireland to turn their district into its own county, Wicklow, however this was ignored.[4]
