The border fortifications were progressively torn down and eventually abandoned in the months following its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports.[183] The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; half were dismissed within five months of the opening.[184] On 1Â July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished;[182] all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs.
