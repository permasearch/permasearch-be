"As If It's Your Last" is described as Black Pink's most exciting and upbeat song that they have released so far.[1] Black Pink's member Jisoo said that the group had thus far in their history only had "Black" concepts up until then, and that this new single would be a "Pink" concept.[21] The song was described as a "mixed genre of house, reggae and moombahton music", a change of sound from their previous releases.[22]
