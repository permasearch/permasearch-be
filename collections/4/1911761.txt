Parkins, the protagonist, a skeptical Cambridge professor, is on holiday in the town of "Burnstow" (a fictionalized version of Felixstowe, Suffolk), on the southeast coast of England. While investigating a Templar ruin for a colleague, he finds a whistle with two Latin inscriptions. On one side it says "Quis est iste, qui venit?". On the other side it says "FLA FUR BIS FLE" in the pattern of a plus sign.
