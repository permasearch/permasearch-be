Although the historic mestizaje of Europeans and Amerindians is evident across all social strata in the Chilean population, there is a strong correlation between the ratio of a Chilean's European and Amerindian genetic components and his or her socioeconomic situation.[4][5] There is a marked continuum[5] existing between the lower classes of a high component of Amerindian ancestry and the upper classes of a predominant component of European ancestry. Indigenous inheritance, whether cultural or genetic, is most pronounced in rural areas and in aspects of culture such as Chilean cuisine and Chilean Spanish. Although post-independence immigrants never made up more than 2% of the population, there are now hundreds of thousands of Chileans with German,[6] British, French, Croatian, Italian or Palestinian[7] ancestry, though these have also been mostly miscegenated with other groups within the country.
