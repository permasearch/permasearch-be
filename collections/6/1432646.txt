Eli Whitney invented his cotton gin in 1793. He began to work on this project after moving to Georgia in search of work. Given that farmers were desperately searching for a way to make cotton farming profitable, a woman named Catharine Greene provided Whitney with funding to create the first cotton gin. Whitney created two cotton gins: a small one that could be hand cranked and a large one that could be driven by a horse or water power. Thanks to the cotton gin, the amount of raw cotton yielded doubled each decade after 1800.
