Most types of porphyria are inherited from a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme.[2] They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner.[1] One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS.[1] The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme.[1] Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected.[1] Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests.[2] Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.[2]
