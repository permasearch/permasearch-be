Parmenides adopted an altogether contrary vision, and emphasized the idea of changeless Being, and considered that change is an illusion of the senses.[53] John Palmer notes "Parmenidesâ€™ distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct from theology."[58]
