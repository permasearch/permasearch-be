Within Australia the term "football" is ambiguous and can mean up to four different codes of football in Australian English, depending on the context, geographical location and cultural factors; this includes soccer, Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union.[11] In the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania the slang term footy is also used in an unofficial context, while in these states the two rugby football codes are called rugby. There is a different situation in New South Wales, Queensland and ACT, where rugby union or rugby league are most popular, and football can refer to those codes.[12] Australia-wide, soccer is commonly used to describe association football, with this usage going back more than a century,[13] with football gaining traction since Soccer Australia was renamed Football Federation Australia in 2005.[14]
