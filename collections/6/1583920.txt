Prior to European settlement, each clan's survival was dependent upon its understanding of food, water and other resources within its own 'Country' â€“ a discrete area of land to which it had more or less exclusive claim. For this reason, traditional Aboriginal culture was highly territorial: visitors risked violent reprisal for crossing a tribal or clan boundary without permission.[11] Although there is no record of a welcome to country ceremony having existed in any traditional Aboriginal society, each group had mandatory protocols for seeking and granting permission to enter land.[4]
