In a section specifically titled, "45 Colt for Ruger or Contender only" Speer makes reference to velocities up to 1300 feet per second with 200 grains bullets. They also state that pressures do not exceed 25,000 psi (CUP). This is well beyond a pressure that can destroy even modern guns chambered in .45 Colt.[11]
