After they lost the title to Test and Booker T,[44] they continued their feud. On the November 5 episode of Raw, The Rock defeated Jericho to regain the WCW Championship. Following the match, Jericho attacked The Rock with a steel chair. At Survivor Series, Jericho solidified his heel turn by almost costing The Rock, and the WWF, victory in their elimination matchup by attacking The Rock again.[46] At Vengeance, Jericho defeated both The Rock for the WCW Championship (unbranded and only referred to as the World Championship following Survivor Series) and Stone Cold Steve Austin for his first WWF Championship on the same night to become the first wrestler to hold both championships at the same time, which made him the first-ever Undisputed WWF Champion, as well as the fourth Grand Slam winner under the original format.[2] He retained the title at Royal Rumble against The Rock[47] and at No Way Out against Austin.[48] Jericho later lost the title to Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania X8.[2]
