Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.[209] Most rituals of witchcraft were very simpleâ€”one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.[210]
