The doctrine of at-will employment has been heavily criticized for its severe harshness upon employees.[40] It has also been criticized as predicated upon flawed assumptions about the inherent distribution of power and information in the employee-employer relationship.[41] On the other hand, conservative scholars in the field of law and economics such as Professors Richard A. Epstein[42] and Richard Posner[43] credit employment at will as a major factor underlying the strength of the U.S. economy.
