On October 23, 2012, after receiving much critical acclaim from the hip hop community, rapper Shyne took to Twitter to disparage the album, calling it "trash" and the production horrible.[93] West Coast rappers Nipsey Hussle, Schoolboy Q and The Game quickly took offense to this, with The Game defending Lamar due to his "non-confrontational nature".[94][95][96] Lamar would later respond to Shyne's comments on October 26, saying that he is not a sensitive person and was unfazed by his comments. In addition he said Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was not necessarily a "classic" as some have called it, but "classic worthy" if enough time would pass.[97] He would later reference Shyne on the song "The Jig Is Up", stating: "I pray to God this beat good enough for Shyne".[98] After Shyne stood by his comments, The Game responded with a freestyle calling out Shyne, entitled "Cough Up a Lung".[99][100] Shyne would later respond with his own diss track in retaliation, titled "Psalms 68 (Guns & Moses)".[101]
