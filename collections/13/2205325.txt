During World War II, rationing was imposed almost immediately. Restrictions were immediately more stringent than in the Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration.[2][7] By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence.[8] Posters encouraged kitchen waste to be used for feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry.
