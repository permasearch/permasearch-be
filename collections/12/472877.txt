Created and introduced by executive producer Brad Bell in 2013, Wyatt is the previously unknown oldest son of Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont) and Quinn Fuller (Rena Sofer).[1] In addition to expanding the Spencer family, Wyatt immediately becomes a rival for his half-brother, Liam Spencer for their father's affections and the affections of Liam's longtime love, Hope Logan (Kim Matula). Wyatt is raised by his single mother, Quinn, and becomes accustomed to doing anything to survive. However, it is his relationship with Hope that helps him change for the better. Despite Wyatt trying to live the best life he can, those around him, specifically Liam, consistently throw his past in his face and accuse him of being bad for Hope and bad for businesses. Wyatt and Liam's rivalry continues when he gets involved with Liam's exes, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood).
