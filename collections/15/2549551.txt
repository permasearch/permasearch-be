Although "Atomic Dog" is now regarded a classic in black popular music,[3] it was at first held back from radio stations.[citation needed] George Clinton’s bad reputation in the industry, his political consciousness (as seen in his previous albums and recordings), and a general move towards more youthful-looking acts, kept his songs from being circulated on radio stations.[citation needed] Only after very strong sales was the song finally put on the air.[citation needed] The single “Atomic Dog” was released in December 1982[citation needed] and reached #1 on the R&B charts, but missed the Hot 100 by just one position.
