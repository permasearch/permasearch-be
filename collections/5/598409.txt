As Mike leaves with his $5 million, he informs Walt that he will continue to pay the legacy costs of hazard payments to Gus's men out of his own money, but that Walt must remove the eavesdropping bugs planted earlier in Hank's office before a sweep is performed by the DEA. Walt avoids Jesse's attempts to get his share of the money and leave the business. Meanwhile, Mike learns through the bugs that the DEA has a search warrant for his house. He gets rid of his weapons and stashes a go bag with cash, a passport, and a gun in an airport parking lot. When Hank and Gomez search his house, they find nothing. Later, Hank is instructed by his superior that he must end his surveillance of Mike and proceed with other cases due to budgetary considerations. Not being instructed otherwise, Hank decides to have Gomez follow Mike's attorney, Dan, who has been placing cash in various safe deposit boxes to facilitate the transfer of the hazard payments and to set aside money for Mike's granddaughter Kaylee. Gomez successfully catches Dan in the act and apprehends him.
