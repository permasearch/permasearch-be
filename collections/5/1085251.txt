The most commonly used proper name of this star comes from the Latin Sīrius, from the Ancient Greek Σείριος (Seirios, "glowing" or "scorcher"),[112] although the Greek word itself may have been imported from elsewhere before the Archaic period,[113] one authority suggesting a link with the Egyptian god Osiris.[114] The name's earliest recorded use dates from the 7th century BC in Hesiod's poetic work Works and Days.[113] In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[115] to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016[116] included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Sirius for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.[117]
