The Book of the Courtier was one of the most widely distributed books of the 16th century, with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers.[2]  The 1561 English translation by Thomas Hoby had a great influence on the English upper class's conception of English gentlemen.[3] The Courtier enjoyed influence for some generations, not least in Elizabethan England following its first translation by Sir Thomas Hoby in 1561, a time when Italian culture was very much in fashion.[4]
