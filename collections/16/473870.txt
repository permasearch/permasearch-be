The Unlimited has the same engine and transmission choices as a short-wheelbase JK. X and Sahara trims offer an option of 4x2 rear-wheel drive in the USA. Optional 4x2 was discontinued after the 2010 model year for the Unlimited. 4-wheel drive became standard for the 2011 model year. It is the only four-door convertible available in the US, since the Hummer H1 with optional rag-top is no longer sold.
