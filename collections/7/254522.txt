Following the changes to the Lotto game, Camelot introduced the Millionaire Raffle (known previously as Lotto Raffle). A raffle number is included automatically with each line of Lotto numbers bought. Each raffle number consists of a colour and eight numbers (e.g. AQUA 4579 2965). Each winning raffle number wins a fixed amount of Â£20,000. Before Oct 2015, 50 raffle numbers were drawn with each Lotto draw and the number of raffle winners increased by 50 each time the Lotto jackpot rolled over, with as many as 250 raffle winners in the event of a quadruple rollover.
