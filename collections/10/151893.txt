The United States government began to implement enforcement of nitromethane limits, with the 2007 Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards list including nitromethane. By the start of the 2008 season, the government began imposing new limits on nitromethane. Currently, there is a limit of 400 pounds (about 42 gallons) that may be possessed at any time. All major drag racing sanctioning bodies must report when teams are in possession over the federal limits.[230]
