Small, electronegative molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are the primary gases in air, significantly impact the ability of surrounding molecules to participate in hydrogen bonding.[21] These molecules compete with surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors for hydrogen bond donors, therefore acting as "hydrogen bond breakers" and weakening interactions between surrounding molecules in the environment.[21] Antiparellel strands in DNA double helices are non-covalently bound by hydrogen bonding between Watson and Crick base pairs;[22] nitrogen and oxygen therefore maintain the potential to weaken the integrity of DNA when exposed to air.[23] As a result, DNA strands exposed to air require less force to separate and exemplify lower melting temperatures.[23]
