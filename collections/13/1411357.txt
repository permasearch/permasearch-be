Federal awards may specify a time period during which the recipient may use the assistance. This is called the Period of Availability of Federal Funds.[5] Most grants have a term of one year (although some may have a longer lifespan, even indefinitely), and the recipient must use the assistance within that timeframe. This is done because federal assistance is tied to the federal governmentâ€™s budget process, and any funds not used by a recipient within the specified time limit is reverted to other uses.
