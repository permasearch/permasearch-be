As of 2004[update] the IETF recognizes Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 as defined by RFC 3411–RFC 3418[18] (also known as STD0062) as the current standard version of SNMP. The IETF has designated SNMPv3 a full Internet standard,[19] the highest maturity level for an RFC. It considers earlier versions to be obsolete (designating them variously "Historic" or "Obsolete").[14]
