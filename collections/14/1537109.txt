In 2000, Croatian mountaineer Stipe Božić completed the Seven Summits.[22] In May 2002, Susan Ershler and her husband, Phil, became the first married couple to climb the "Seven Summits" together.[23] The first person to complete Seven Summits without the use of supplemental oxygen on Mount Everest is Reinhold Messner.[24] Miroslav Caban is probably the second climber to finish the project without supplemental oxygen on Everest (finished in 2005 with Carstensz). Ed Viesturs also summitted all peaks without supplemental oxygen.[25] Between 2002 and 2007, Austrian climber Christian Stangl completed the Seven Summits (Messner list), climbing alone and without supplemental oxygen, and reported a record total ascent time from respective base camp to summit of 58 hours and 45 minutes.[26][27]
