Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredi-bile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob during his time as Mr. Incredible, and reach the Everjust. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint Supers as a menace. They subdue the ship's crew members and aim the high-speed ship at Municiberg before destroying the controls. When the Parr children find them, Jack-Jack telekinetically removes the goggles from Elastigirl, who in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. A battle ensues on the ship in which the Parrs and Frozone release all the other mind-controlled Supers by destroying their goggles. With Mr. Incredible swimming underwater to turn the rudder and Frozone creating layers of ice, they manage to slow the Everjust enough to prevent it from crashing into the city. Evelyn tries to escape in a jet, but is captured by Elastigirl. Following the incident, Evelyn is arrested, and Supers around the world regain full legal status.
