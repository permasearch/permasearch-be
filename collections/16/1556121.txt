Kaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for ABC's sitcom Taxi, appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978-83.[citation needed] Bob Zmuda confirms this: "They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the Taxi character Latka."[22] Kaufman's longtime manager George Shapiro encouraged him to take the gig.
