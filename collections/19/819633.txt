Vehicle testing has been mandatory in France since 1992. The first inspection (ContrÃ´le Technique) is carried out after four years then subsequently every two years. A blue and white CT sticker affixed inside the windscreen indicates when the next test is due. A less than 6 month valid CT is required prior to transfer of ownership.
