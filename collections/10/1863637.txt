The North Dakota Department of Transportation building is home to the central office of the state's transportation department, as well as small divisions of other agencies. The building was completed in 1968 and was built with materials that harmonize visually with the pre-existing structures on the grounds. Before the building was completed, the Department of Transportation, known then as the State Highway Department, was in various buildings around the campus including the State Office Building and the Capitol building itself. The building contains 125,000 square feet (11,600Â m2) of gross building area and is just to the east of the Capitol tower. While above ground the building is separated from the tower, it is still connected to the Judicial Wing of the tower by an underground tunnel accessible only to state employees.[16]
