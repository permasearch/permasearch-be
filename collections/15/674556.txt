The music video features children painted in the colours of the representative countries participating in the tournament. For example, it depicts a group of Scottish children kicking off a match against Brazilian children while playing Scottish Bagpipes, mirroring the opening game at France 1998. A subsequent scene involving Jamaican children is set to music with steel drums.
