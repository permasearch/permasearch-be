At about 3:00Â p.m., shortly after forcing a group of police officers to take cover in a ditch, Bryant rang the local police station. The wife of one of the police officers answered the phone. Bryant asked who she was and if she knew where her husband was. He again called himself Jamie. He asked if she knew whether or not her husband was okay, and when she did not answer, Bryant then told her he was okay and that he knew where her husband was.
