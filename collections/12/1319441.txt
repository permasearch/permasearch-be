The Bride, one of the Mansion's most enigmatic characters, haunts the Attic. Inspiration for the character can be traced back to legends including the Brown Lady of Raynham Hall. The Bride has been altered on numerous occasions over the years, appearing now at Disneyland and Walt Disney World as Constance Hatchawayâ€”the "Black Widow Bride," using a digital projection effect.
