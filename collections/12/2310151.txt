Brokenstar is a huge long-furred, dark brown tabby tom with bright amber eyes, torn ears, a broad, flat face, a battle-scarred muzzle, and a tail that is bent in the middle like a broken branch. He was the former leader of ShadowClan before Nightstar and is depicted somewhat as the primary antagonist of Into the Wild.[1]  He was a cruel cat who turned kits into apprentices three moons too soon, which in turn led to their deaths. He was the son of Raggedstar and Yellowfang, but didn't know that the latter was his mother, who bore him and two she-kits (who died) in secret. He was given to an ambitious queen named Lizardstripe to be fostered instead. Lizardstripe would not accept Brokentail in her den when he was a kit, purely because he had a crooked tail.[56] Brokentail grew into a great warrior and eventually became deputy, but he murdered his own father, Raggedstar, so that he could become leader and exiled Yellowfang from ShadowClan, falsely accusing her of murdering two apprentices that he himself killed by forcing them into warrior training too soon. This banishment led to Yellowfang's acceptance into ThunderClan. In Into The Wild, when Brokenstar is first introduced, Yellowfang and Firepaw drove Brokenstar and his supporters out of ShadowClan in a revolt.[1]  Brokentail lived as a rogue in Fire and Ice, and attacked the ThunderClan camp in an attempt to kill Fireheart but was blinded by Yellowfang.[8] He was then taken prisoner and stripped of his leadership status, renamed to his old warrior name of Brokentail. He plotted with Tigerclaw in Forest of Secrets to attack ThunderClan along with his rogue allies, though the attack failed.[12] When the rogues were chased out and Tigerclaw was exiled, Yellowfang decided to end Brokentail's life by feeding him deathberries, also revealing to him that she was really his mother. Later, in Sunset, he is implied to be in the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars with Tigerstar, Hawkfrost, and Darkstripe after the latter scents him.[13]
