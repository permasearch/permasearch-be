The grand marriage is a symbol of social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ada marriage also greatly increases a manâ€™s standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ada marriage.
