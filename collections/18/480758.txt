Sossamon beat Kate Hudson for the lead female role in Brian Helgeland's medieval adventure dramedy A Knight's Tale, opposite Heath Ledger.[14] She was cast as Lady Jocelyn, the love interest of a peasant (Ledger) pretending to be a knight in the world of Middle Age jousting. The film premiered on May 11, 2001,[15] and received average reviews,[16] with her part getting an equally mixed response; Robin Clifford for Reeling Reviews concluded that Sossamon was "pretty but little more than an object of affection"[17] and Rob Blackwelder, of SPLICEDwire, called her role "the movie's weakest link", noting that although Sossamon was a "wonderfully wicked flirt", her character "isn't terribly well established and she's the most jarringly modern sight in this ancient tale".[18] A Knight's Tale garnered US$117,487,473 worldwide,[19] bringing Sossamon into mainstream audiences. It earned the actress two Teen Choice Awards nominations as well as three MTV Movie Awards nominations, including one for "Best Breakthrough Performance".[20][21][22]
