Yates becomes pregnant and gives birth to their daughter Tiger Lily and they become a family. Murphy also resigns from INXS. The band and Hutchence get back together to make "Elegantly Wasted" and start touring again. After practice, in preparation for their 20th anniversary tour, Hutchence goes to his hotel room on November where he makes various calls, including checking up on the progress of a potential custody agreement between Bob and Paula, which would allow Paula to bring Tiger and her other daughters to Australia for Christmas. However Paula informs Michael that the custody hearing is being adjourned until 17 December and that consequently she would not be bringing their daughter (not wanting to separate Tiger from her sisters) out to Australia. Hutchence angrily phones Geldof, blaming him for the outcome of the hearing and ranting, "She's not your wife anymore!". He then falls into depression and calls Michele for help. The next day at practice, INXS turns on the TV only to see the news of Hutchence's suicide. Tim is especially devastated as he and Michael had an argument and never had the chance to make up. The movie ends with actual clips of the real INXS playing live.
