To accommodate Muslim-majority population, all McDonald's in Indonesia are certified halal, which means they do not serve bacon or pork patties, while serving only beef, chicken, and fish.[17] Local items include crispy and spicy fried chicken; the McRice, a small mound of steamed rice wrapped in paper and available to supersize; McSoup, a chicken flavored soup with bits of croutons and vegetables; and Buryam (short for bubur ayam or chicken congee), later renamed as Bubur Ayam Spesial with the addition of fried egg topping.[18] Sambal chili sauce, an essential component of Indonesian cuisine, and tomato ketchup are available as condiments.
