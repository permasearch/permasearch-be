Many lighthouses were built around the Mediterranean and the coasts of the empire, including the Tower of Hercules at A Coru√±a in northern Spain, a structure which survives to this day. A smaller lighthouse at Dover, England also exists as a ruin about half the height of the original. The light would have been provided by a fire at the top of the structure.
