A year later, Bagley returned to Lowell, working for the Hamilton Mills and living with one of her brothers. While based in Lowell, she traveled throughout New England, writing about health care, working conditions, prison reform, and women’s rights.[14] In 1849, she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she worked with the Quakers as the executive secretary of the Rosine Home, providing a safe place for prostitutes and disadvantaged young women.[5] While in Philadelphia, Bagley met James Durno (1795–1871), a native of Aberdeen, Scotland; they married on November 13, 1850.[15]
