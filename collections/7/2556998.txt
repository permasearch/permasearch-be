From 1956 to 1958, Bowie was the subject of a CBS television series, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas.[120] The show, which starred Scott Forbes as Jim Bowie, was based on the 1946 novel Tempered Blade.[121]
