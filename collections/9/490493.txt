El Shaddai (Hebrew: אֵל שַׁדַּי‎, IPA: [el ʃaˈdːaj]) or just Shaddai is one of the names of the God of Israel. El Shaddai is conventionally translated as God Almighty but the construction of the phrase fits the pattern of the divine appellations in the Ancient Near East and as such can convey various types of semantic relations between these two words: El of a place known as Shaddai, El possessing the quality of shaddai or El who is also known as Shaddai – exactly as is the case with the names like "’El Olam", "’El Elyon" or "’El Betel".[1][2] Moreover, while the translation of El as "god" or "lord" in the Ugaritic/Canaanite language is straightforward, the literal meaning of Shaddai is the subject of debate.
