The Middle New river runs from Glade Creek to Cunard. This is a great family friendly part of the river with mainly class II rapids but a few class III (3) rapids are sprinkled in including Grassy Shoals Rapid just after Glade Creek and Quinnamont Rapid named for it's location by the old town of Quinnamont. Further down the river is The Ledges rapid and Silo rapid. these are just prior to Dun Glen and Thurmond. Also there is Suprise rapid a little ways before the take out at Cunard.
