In 1856, Nikumaroro was claimed as "Kemins Island" by CA Williams & Co. of New London, Connecticut, under the American Guano Islands Act. No record exists of guano deposits ever being exploited, however.[9] On 28 May 1892, the island was claimed by the United Kingdom during a call by HMS Curacoa.[5] Almost immediately, a license was granted to Pacific entrepreneur John T. Arundel for planting coconuts.[5] Twenty-nine islanders were settled there and some structures with corrugated iron roofs were constructed, but a severe drought resulted in the failure of this project within a year. In 1916, it was leased to a Captain E.F.H. Allen of the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, but remained uninhabited until 1938.[5]
