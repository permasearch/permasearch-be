Dean Toadblatt is the headmaster of Toadblatt's School of Sorcery, and a spoof of Albus Dumbledore (and Severus Snape). Toadblatt is a large, humanoid toad wearing a purple wizard's robe. He hates Nigel Planter with a passion, and goes to various lengths to remove him from his school. After John Vernon's passing, Toadblatt's voice and entire character design was entirely changed for the next cartoon. Only one character noticed the change, and was dragged away to an unknown end. This was a parody of the fact that two actors portrayed Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films (when Richard Harris died, the role went to Michael Gambon).
