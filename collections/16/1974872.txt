Marilyn Polarski (portrayed by Kate Kneeland) was the wife of Sergeant George Polarski, an NCO in Trevor's unit. She was well-known amongst the Army wives as the "Gossip Queen". However Roxy found out that Marilyn was having an affair with a civilian man named Eddie. Her husband eventually discovered and Marilyn angrily confronted Roxy, accusing of telling Trevor, who was acquainted with her husband, about the affair, which Roxy denied. Roxy mentioned that she slipped to Pamela and Marilyn confronted Pamela about it, which Pamela also vehemently denied. When Pamela angrily retorted to Marilyn to "do us all a favor and get a divorce", Marilyn confided to her that she was extremely unhappy with her marriage but lacked the courage or resources to get a divorce. Roxy considered telling Trevor but Pamela stopped her, stating that Army wives are bound by an unspoken code to protect one another.[17] Pamela later discovered that she was a victim of spousal abuse and that she was petrified of her husband George. Marilyn tried to run away with Eddie in the Season 1 finale after George physically threatened her and was killed when her deranged husband walked into The Hump Bar with a bomb strapped to himself and detonated it.
