Hokuto Ryūken (北斗琉拳, Big Dipper Lapis Lazuli Fist) is a fighting style which branched off from the main Hokuto family along with Hokuto Shinken that was founded by Shuken's cousin Ryūō. The style uses the 1109 destructive points of the human body called the Keiraku Hakō (経絡破孔, lit. "Destructive Meridian Points") in contrast to the 708 Keiraku Hikō points of the Shin Ken style (The exact differences between the Ryūken style's hakō points and the Shin Ken style's hikō points are never fully explained) as well as an evil energy called Matōki no Aura (魔闘気, "Demonic Fighting Spirit Aura") that can drive its practitioner insane with evil, turning them into a Majin (魔神, God of Black Magic). The three Rashō (羅将, "Lords of Shura") that Kenshiro faces are all masters of this art. The ultimate Hokuto Ryuken technique is Anryū Tenha (暗琉天破, "Dark Sparkling Stone Heaven Destruction") which levitates a person in the air and completely disorients them.
