Side two began with a 15-minute rendition of "My Generation", which was greatly extended to include a medley of other songs and various improvisations. These included a brief extract of "See Me, Feel Me" and the ending of "Sparks" from Tommy, and part of "Naked Eye" that was recorded for the follow-up album Lifehouse (that was ultimately abandoned in favour of Who's Next). The album closed with "Magic Bus", which included Daltrey playing harmonica and an extended ending to the song.[15]
