Although naturally left-footed,[161] James has shown ambidexterity in his dribbling and style of play.[168][169] His goal scoring abilities were a highlight of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he managed to claim the Golden Boot despite Colombia's elimination in the quarter finals following a 2â€“1 loss to Brazil.[7] He is also an accurate free kick taker, and a goal threat from anywhere on the pitch.[161] This has made James recognized for his unpredictability as noted by Marca writer Justin Sherman: "One of the differences that James has with other players is that, apart from being very good outside the area, he is also good inside. He has the qualities of a No. 9 and is capable of finishing with a shot from the head or with either foot with great effectiveness."[167]
