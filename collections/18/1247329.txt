Nana's personality changes over her appearances. Initially, she appears as a very aggressive old lady with incredible martial arts skills. In The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper, she is shown to be aggressive with anyone, no matter how courteous people are with her. But in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, she appears to be kinder than before, even leading the New Yorkers when she notices that they are in panic, only being aggressive with wild animals; which she sees as no different from domestic animals. She is also shown to be a soft and grandmotherly figure to the New Yorkers. For example, when a man helps her find her handbag, she says, "Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it."
