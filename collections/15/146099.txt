During the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy, in the 311 Edict of Toleration Galerius, the Augustus in the East, ended the Diocletian persecution of Christianity. Two years later, in 313, Constantine the Great, the Augustus in the West, expanded religious liberty for Christians and returned property confiscated from Christians in his Edict of Milan; he patronized the Church of Rome by constructing large church buildings such as the Lateran Basilica and Lateran Palace and the Old St. Peter's Basilica, and donated endowments.[57] The First Council of Nicaea approved a church arrangement whereby the bishops of an imperial province were headed by the bishop (known as the "metropolitan") of the principal city.[58][discuss] This added to the power of the bishops of important cities.
