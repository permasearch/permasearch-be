RuneScape has original music and ambient soundscapes. The music was designed to define the underlying cultures of the various locations accessible, and ambient sounds, such as the cry of seagulls flying over the ocean, occur in logical places.[96] The game also incorporates voice acting in certain areas and situations.[54] The RuneScape 3 update included orchestral music recorded in Bratislava, Slovakia, and was scored by James Hannigan.[82]
