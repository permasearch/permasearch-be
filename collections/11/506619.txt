The speed limit on most rural Interstates is 70 mph. Urban Interstate speed limits generally vary from 55 mph to 65 mph.[217] Sections of I-64 and I-68 have lower truck speed limits because of steep grades; otherwise, West Virginia does not post separate truck speed limits. The West Virginia Turnpike between Chelyan and Mahan has a 60 mph speed limit because of sharp curves.
