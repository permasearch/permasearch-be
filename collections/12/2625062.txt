Rape was a widespread phenomenon in the East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women.[338] Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape.[339] Frequently in the case of Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence.[340] Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East.[341] She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.[342]
