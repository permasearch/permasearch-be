The video begins with a car (1972 Plymouth Barracuda) pulling into a creepy alleyway with Corey Taylor being pulled out of the trunk by his bandmates. He is then lead upstairs to be strapped into a chair and interrogated by a woman (Joanna Moskawa) who seems to have an aggression towards him. As this is happening, ghostly images of the band perform in front of each member, the video also features these images solo inside an abandoned warehouse including Taylor. Taylor is then blindfolded and then a weird screen is brought out. Corey then walks into the room from the shadows, with a shaved head, wearing a suit and sunglasses. He takes the sunglasses off and then the blindfold is removed, revealing the woman from before. At the end of the solo and the final "everything to" shaved Corey presses the button and the other Corey is then seen singing on the screen. The lady panics from this sight and the rest of the band have smiles on their faces. At the end of the video the band leaves the lady tied. Right before it fades to black, the screen says "What did you see?" This was part of a contest that the band held to see the concept of the video, which had a code which read "I am you" which explains the fact Corey was replaced with the woman.
