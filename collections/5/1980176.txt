There is also a very limited "parliamentary" service from here to Streatham Hill via the Leigham spur - as of May 2016, one train per day calls on weekdays (westbound only) at 10.23am before travelling over this curve (having originated at London Bridge).[3] It has in the past operated in the other direction (such as in the 2005-6 timetable, when it ran as the 15.52 Streatham Hill to London Bridge).[4]
