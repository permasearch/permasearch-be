Before the JWP recognition of their priority, the Japanese team had unofficially suggested various names: japonium, after their home country;[43] nishinanium, after Japanese physicist Yoshio Nishina, the "founding father of modern physics research in Japan";[44] and rikenium, after the institute.[43] After the recognition, the Riken team gathered in February 2016 to decide on a name. Morita expressed his desire for the name to honour the fact that element 113 had been discovered in Japan. Japonium was considered, making the connection to Japan easy to identify for non-Japanese, but it was rejected as Jap is considered an ethnic slur. The name nihonium was chosen after an hour of deliberation: it comes from nihon (日本), one of the two Japanese pronunciations for the name of Japan.[45] The discoverers also intended to reference the support of their research by the Japanese people (Riken being almost entirely government-funded),[46] recover lost pride and trust in science among those who were affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster,[47] and honour Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa's 1908 discovery of rhenium, which he named "nipponium" with symbol Np after the other Japanese pronunciation of Japan's name.[38] As Ogawa's claim had not been accepted, the name "nipponium" could not be reused for a new element, and its symbol Np had since been used for neptunium.[b] In March 2016, Morita proposed the name "nihonium" to IUPAC, with the symbol Nh.[38]
