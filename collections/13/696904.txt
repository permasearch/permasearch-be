After an anemic 2006 which saw the Golden Knights go a mere 4–8,[80] the team rebranded in 2007 in preparation for its move to its new on-campus venue, Spectrum Stadium.[81] They dropped the "Golden" from their name, becoming the "UCF Knights".[82] Fortunes seemed to have changed as the Knights moved into new facilities. After defeating a BCS school for just the second time ever, NC State by a score of 25-23,[83] they inaugurated their new stadium by hosting and losing to national power #6 Texas by a score of 35-32.[84] The Knights lost to archrival South Florida by a score of 64-12 in Tampa,[85] but went on to have a 10–4 overall record and won the C-USA East again, hosting the Championship game against Tulsa once more.[86] UCF defeated Tulsa in a near-reversal of the 2005 Conference USA Championship Game 44-25,[87] thereby gaining UCF's first ever Conference Championship title and a berth in the 2007 Liberty Bowl. Following UCF's victory, the Knights received 35 votes in the AP Poll, but did not reach the top 25, ranking 27th.[88] The Knights lost the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee by a score of 10-3 to Mississippi State.[89] The Knights went on to finish the year with its first 10 win season in the FBS. In 2007, Kevin Smith set an NCAA record with 450 rushing attempts and rushed for 2,567 yards, placing him 2nd on the NCAA's all-time single season rushing list behind only Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders.[90] Despite this, he was not selected even as a finalist for the Doak Walker Award.[90] He also was the only running back in the 2007 season to rush for more than 100 yards against the Texas Longhorns.[90] He was a fan favorite, especially with student section at Bright House Networks Stadium.[90] Smith originally stated that he would return for his senior season at UCF,[91] however, he later changed his mind, announcing on January 6, 2008 that he would declare for the 2008 NFL Draft.[92] He was selected with the first pick in the third round by the Detroit Lions.[93]
