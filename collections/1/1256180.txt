White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm, a nematode parasite that causes caribou, moose (Alces alces), elk (Cervus canadensis), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to develop fatal neurological symptoms[72][73][74] which include a loss of fear of humans. White-tailed deer that carry this worm are partly immune to it.[75] Changes in climate and habitat beginning in the twentieth century have expanded range overlap between white-tailed deer and caribou, increasing the frequency of infection within the caribou population. This increase in infection is a concern for wildlife managers.
