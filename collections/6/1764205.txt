In 2014, the No. 22 car was shared by Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski, Ryan Blaney, and Alex Tagliani in hopes of defending the Nationwide Owners' Championship. Michael McDowell ran the car at Kentucky in September, the fifth driver to run the car in 2014.[36] The No. 22 team beat the No. 54 JGR team once again for the owner's title. They again beat the No. 54 team for the owners title in 2015, before going winless in 2016. In 2017 Brad Keselowski brought the 22 back to victory lane at Pocono after a last lap pass on Kyle Larson. The No. 22 team is known for its competition for the Nationwide Owner's Championship with the equally strong Joe Gibbs Racing and their No. 18 and No. 20 teams.
