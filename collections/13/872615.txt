Emperor Justinian I assigned to five sees, those of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, a superior ecclesial authority that covered the whole of his empire. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 reaffirmed that the bishop of a provincial capital, the metropolitan bishop, had a certain authority over the bishops of the province.[42] But it also recognized the existing supra-metropolitan authority of the sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch,[43] and granted special recognition to Jerusalem.[44][45][46]
