Moisturizing agents (also known as emollients) are recommended at least once or twice a day.[4] Oilier formulations appear to be better and water-based formulations are not recommended.[4] It is unclear if moisturizers that contain ceramides are more or less effective than others.[45] Products that contain dyes, perfumes, or peanuts should not be used.[4] Occlusive dressings at night may be useful.[4]
