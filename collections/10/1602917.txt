In the Bhagavad Gita, jnana yoga is also referred to as buddhi yoga and its goal is self-realization.[30] The text considers jnana marga as the most difficult, slow, confusing for those who prefer it because it deals with "formless reality", the avyakta. It is the path that intellectually oriented people tend to prefer.[31]
