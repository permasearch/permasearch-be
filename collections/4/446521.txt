The City of Memphis's contract with the Grizzlies forbade the use of The Pyramid without the team's approval, and as a result, it went dark.  A committee headed by Memphis businessman Scott Ledbetter studied possible uses of the arena in 2005, and considered such uses as converting the arena into a casino, an aquarium, a shopping mall, or an indoor theme park.[9] In November 2006, Congressman-Elect Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) suggested that he would attempt to open a "Mid-American branch" of the Smithsonian Institution in the building. However, these plans were never realized.  In the end, the Ledbetter committee on the building's future recommended that it be used for "destination retail" which would create more jobs and new tax revenues.
