Fox suffered an outage during their broadcast of Game 1, resulting in a loss of coverage for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute delay in-game while officials addressed the availability of video review due to the loss of Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.[77]
