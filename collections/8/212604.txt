Once more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. La Albiceleste cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa América final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2–1. Further victories against Panama and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum amount of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4–1. They then dispatched hosts United States 4–0 to earn yet another final clash against Chile.
