The traditional Independence Day Reception (in Finnish: Linnanjuhlat, "the Castle Ball") at the presidential palace on 6 December is one of the key annual events in the presidential calendar. It originated as a celebration of Finland's national independence and pride, and although nowadays it is seen by some as a glorified social party, the reception is broadcast every year on television and draws a large viewing audience. The number of guests invited has varied from about 1,600 to 2,000. With the exception of ambassadors, only Finns are invited.
