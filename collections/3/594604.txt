Ubisoft said that when Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption released midway through Assassin's Creed III's development, it was surprised to see Rockstar had included wild animal hunting and a giant frontier to exploreâ€”features both planned for its own sequel. Lead writer Corey May said Ubisoft's now looking at Red Dead's success and trying to take the formula in "new directions". Similarities between these two games are down to "a convergence of minds", said Assassin's Creed III writer Matt Turner.[34] Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said Ubisoft steered clear of making the Assassin's Creed III protagonist a female character because the game's setting is not a strong match. Hutchinson said while many people wanted to see female assassins in the series, the American Revolution setting makes it difficult this time round.[35]
