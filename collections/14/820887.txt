Five continues to be churlish and flips to steel to break Nine's hands in response to Nine's constant bullying. Bernie Kosar goes nuts over an antler artifact from a chest, trying to use it to call the other chimera. A capture the flag game ensues in the newly restored training room where Marina wins the day. John and Sarah go out on a date to the zoo and discover three Mogadorian spies collecting an envelope, filled with notes unhelpfully written in Mogadorian. Malcolm whips up a translator to figure out what was said. Sam attempts to ask Six out but is interrupted by Eight, who claims there is an emergency. The emergency is that Ella's bad dreams have gotten worse. John touches her to try to wake her up and is sucked in, falling into a coma-like state. Urged on in part by Five's story of a healing prism in his lost chest, the rest of the group go off to get the chest to help their friends.
