Commercially pure flat product (sheet, plate) can be formed readily, but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a "memory" and tends to spring back. This is especially true of certain high-strength alloys.[65][66] Titanium cannot be soldered without first pre-plating it in a metal that is solderable.[67] The metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as stainless steel.[14]
