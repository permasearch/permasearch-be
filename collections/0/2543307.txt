The continuing search for Burgess Shale fossils since the mid-1970s has led to the description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris[11] and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges.[12] Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named.[13] They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006.[14] Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.[15]
