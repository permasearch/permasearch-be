A mermaid resembling Ariel from the Disney film The Little Mermaid makes a cameo appearance during the "Accidentally in Love" scene in Shrek 2, when Shrek and Fiona are on the beach during their honeymoon. A wave comes in and then goes back out, leaving her on top of Shrek, kissing him. Fiona throws her back into the sea, where she is eaten by sharks (though it is not certain whether she is eaten by sharks or merely attacked).
