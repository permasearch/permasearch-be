In 2005, for the second season of Desperate Housewives, the street went through some heavy changes. During the first season only one part of the street had been seen on the show – the cul-de-sac at the end of the street, known as 'Circle Drive' among film crews,[3] had been left out. Now the majority of the buildings and façades in this part of the street were either heavily remodeled or removed. Among the most noticeable changes were the removals of a church façade, seen on Murder, She Wrote, in order to make room for Edie's house,[4]  and of the so-called Colonial Mansion, which was replaced by a park.[5] In the film Beethoven's 3rd (2000) the street can clearly be seen with the shops and the Church still in place around 'Circle Drive'. The shot begins in circle drive at the shops then Mrs McCluskey's, Lynette's, Katherine's, Bree's, Susan's, Mary Alice's, Betty's and Gaby's are also in shot. The shot then continues into Gaby's driveway and then down the rest of the street.
