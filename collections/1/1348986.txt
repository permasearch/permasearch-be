To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 767 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear.[6] The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes.[41] The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes.[101] To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable tailskid.[101][102] The 767 has left-side exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft.[24]
