The first cover of the song was a recording by the Rolling Stones in 1965, shortly after Redding's original version became a hit. It was included on the Stones' first live album, Got Live If You Want It!, although the track was a studio recording that had been overdubbed with audience noises.[7] Returning the compliment, Redding covered the Rolling Stones song "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
