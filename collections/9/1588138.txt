Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level.[1] A Test match takes place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing Full Member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC).[2][3] Sri Lanka obtained Full Member status of the ICC in 1981, becoming the eighth nation eligible to play Test cricket.[4] The Sri Lanka national cricket team played their first Test match on 17 February 1982 against England, and recorded their first victory in a match against India on 6 September 1985.[5] Since then, they have played nearly 200 matches, against every other Test-playing nation.[6] Sri Lanka holds the world record for the highest team score, which was established against India in 1997.[7] The highest partnership in Test cricket was also established by two Sri Lankan batsmen; Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.[8] Sri Lankan players also hold the highest partnership scores for the second and third wickets.[9]
