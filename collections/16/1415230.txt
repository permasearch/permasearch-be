WrestleMania XXVIII received generally positive critical reception, with appraisal going to the main event, the WWE Championship match, and the match between The Undertaker and Triple H, though the World Heavyweight Championship match was panned. Rob McNichol, writing for British tabloid The Sun, scored the event 8.5/10, with CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho being the match of the night for the 'wrestling purists.' However, they cited the "first 60 minutes of this four-hour show were a disaster", ridiculing the decision of the World Heavyweight Championship bout, describing it as a "transparent virtual slap in the face to those who admire the talents of the Irishman and the American Dragon."[55] Examiner.com rated WrestleMania as 4 out of 5 stars, giving the match of the night to Triple H vs. The Undertaker, describing it as "a barrage of violence, passion, and pacing displayed by all three performers in the brutal cage", while also criticizing the beginning of the show as 'underwhelming.' The Canadian Online Explorer ranked the show 6.5/10, giving full marks to both the Hell in a Cell and WWE Championship matches, whereas the Rock vs John Cena received a 7/10 rating.[56]
