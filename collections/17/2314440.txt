The technical investigations Butler conducted during her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications.[10] The culmination of the research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.[10] The exhibition was small, with a handful of paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp.[11] Two Saint Christopher's, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered to be by workshop members.[12] From Cleveland came a John the Baptist in the Landscape, thought to be by van Eyck followers.[13] The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for probably the first time since the 15th century.[14]
