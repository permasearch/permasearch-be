Section 10.27 of Circular 230 has traditionally included restrictions on contingent fee arrangements between taxpayers and their representatives. In July 2014, however, those restrictions were struck down by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia "with respect to the preparation and filing of Ordinary Refund Claims, where 'preparation and filing' precedes the inception of any examination or adjudication of the refund claim by the IRS and any formal legal representation on the part of the practitioner." The Court ordered that the government was permanently prohibited from enforcing the applicable restrictions in Circular 230.[9]
