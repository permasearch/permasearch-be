The Constitution Act, 1982 (Schedule B of the Parliament of the United Kingdom's Canada Act 1982) is a part of the Constitution of Canada. Section 60 states that the Act may be called the Constitution Act, 1982, and that the Constitution Acts can be collectively called the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982. The act was introduced as part of Canada's process of patriating the constitution, introducing several amendments[1] to the British North America Act, 1867, and changing the latter's name in Canada to the Constitution Act, 1867.
