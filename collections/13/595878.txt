Paul Broca associated regions of the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients.[230] John Hughlings Jackson described the function of the motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided regions of the brain based on the appearance of cells.[230] By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions.[231][232][233] The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.[234]
