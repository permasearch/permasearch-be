PBDEs have the potential to disrupt thyroid hormone balance and contribute to a variety of neurological and developmental deficits, including low intelligence and learning disabilities.[126][127]  Many of the most common PBDE's were banned in the European Union in 2006.[128] Studies with rodents have suggested that even brief exposure to PBDEs can cause developmental and behavior problems in juvenile rodents[35][129] and exposure interferes with proper thyroid hormone regulation.[130]
