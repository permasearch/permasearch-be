In the turbulent political and religious climate during the reign of Mary Tudor is found the earliest reference to a registration system in the Kingdom of England in London in July 1556 whereby: that the poste between this and the Northe should eche of them keepe a booke and entrye of every letter that he shall receive, the tyme of the deliverie thereof unto his hands with the parties names that shall bring it unto him, whose handes he shall also take to his booke, witnessing the same note to be trewe.[3] This was likely for state security rather than mail security.[4] In 1603, another Order of Council was made whereby all letters had to be recorded.[3] This system was in effect a registration system although it applied to all items sent via the post.
