Whether counsel is retained or appointed, the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal.[8] The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,[9] but some conflicts are un-waiveable.[10]
