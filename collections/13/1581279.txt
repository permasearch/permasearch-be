Historically, slavery in Eastern North America in the 17th and 18th century began in the English colonies. Slavery in the colonial US was established in each of the Thirteen Colonies. During British colonization, the number of people in slavery expanded, primarily drawn from the Atlantic slave trade.[1] Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century.[2] The sentiments of the American Revolution (1775-1783) and the equality evoked by the Declaration of Independence stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order. Thousands also joined the British army, encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service.[2] (See Black Patriot and Black Loyalist).
