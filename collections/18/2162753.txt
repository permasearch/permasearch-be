Brazilian waxing is the removal of all pubic hair from the pelvic region, vulva, labia, perineum,[22][23] and anus, while sometimes leaving a thin strip of hair on the mons pubis.[4][14][15][16][24] It can be used by those who wear thong bikinis.[25] Brazilian waxing is also known as a full Brazilian wax, full bikini wax, or the Hollywood wax.[4][15][16] This style was first called the Brazilian wax by the J. Sisters salon in Manhattan, founded in 1987 by seven sisters named Padilha from Brazil.[26][27]
