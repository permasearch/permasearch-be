Frogs include the smallest vertebrates known. The smallest known frog species is Paedophryne amauensis, with a snout-vent length reported as 7.7 mm, which occurs among leaf-litter in the tropical montane forests of New Guinea. Other very small frogs include Brachycephalus didactylus from Brazil (reported as 9.6-9.8 mm), several species of Eleutherodactylus such as Eleutherodactylus iberia (around 10mm) from Cuba, Gardiner's Frog Sechellophryne gardineri from the Seychelles (up to 11 mm), several species of Stumpffia such as Stumpffia tridactyla and Stumpffia pygmaea from Madagascar, and the Rough Moss-frog Arthroleptella rugosa of South Africa (11.9 - 14.1 mm). In general these extremely small frogs occur in tropical forest and montane environments. There is relatively little data on size variation among individuals, growth from metamorphosis to adulthood or size variation among populations in these species. Additional studies and the discovery of further minute frog species are likely to change the rank order of this list.
