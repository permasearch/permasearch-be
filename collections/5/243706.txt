When Poirot and Dr. Constantine examine Ratchett's compartment, Poirot finds a trace of a burned note with the words '-member little Daisy Armstrong' on it, which leads him to doubt Ratchett's identity. A few years before, three-year-old Daisy Armstrong was kidnapped by a man named Cassetti, who collected a ransom but killed the child anyway. Cassetti was caught but fled the country after he was acquitted on a technicality. Poirot concludes that Ratchett and Cassetti are one and the same.
