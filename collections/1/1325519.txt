Scottish Gaelic in Islay and Argyll is fairly similar to Irish.[citation needed] The extinct dialects of northeast Ulster, particularly Rathlin Island, were also close to Scottish Gaelic.[citation needed] In Scotland, dialects also existed in southern Kintyre and Galloway which were probably similar to Irish, sliabh (mountain) being fairly common as an element in Galloway and Irish placenames, but quite rare in the Highlands[citation needed]. The dialects of these Scottish and Irish regions are also, in turn, the most similar to Manx.
