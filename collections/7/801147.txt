In the United Kingdom, dietitians must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC, formerly the Health Professions Council, HPC) in order to be able to work for the National Health Service.[19] The education requirements include obtaining either a BSc in dietetics or a postgraduate qualification approved by the HCPC.
