In 1902 the Swedish Society for Woman Suffrage was founded. In 1906 the suggestion of women's suffrage was voted down in parliament again.[134] In 1909, the right to vote in municipal elections were extended to include also married women.[135] The same year, women were granted eligibility to municipal councils,[135] and in the following 1910–11 municipal elections, forty women were elected to different municipal councils,[134] Gertrud Månsson being the first. In 1914 Emilia Broomé became the first woman in the legislative assembly.[136]
