Its common definition is a thunderstorm complex that produces a damaging wind swath of at least 250 miles (400 km),[8] featuring a concentrated area of convectively-induced wind gusts exceeding 50 knots (60 mph; 90 km/h).[1] According to the National Weather Service criterion, a derecho is classified as a band of storms that have winds of at least 50 knots (90 km/h; 60 mph) along the entire span of the storm front, maintained over a time span of at least six hours. Some studies add a requirement that no more than two or three hours separate any two successive wind reports.[9] Derechos typically possess a high or rapidly increasing forward speed. They have a distinctive appearance on radar (known as a bow echo) with several unique features, such as the rear inflow notch and bookend vortices, and usually they manifest two or more downbursts.
