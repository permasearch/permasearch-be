All mesons are unstable because of weak decay.[12] In the process known as beta decay, a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual Wâˆ’ boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino.[13] Another example is the electron capture, a common variant of radioactive decay, wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact, and are changed to a neutron (an up quark is changed to a down quark) and an electron neutrino is emitted.
