John Barry, who supervised the music and composed the score, won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Theme.[22] Fred Neil's song "Everybody's Talkin'" won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Harry Nilsson. Schlesinger chose the song as its theme, and the song underscores the first act. Other songs considered for the theme included Nilsson's own "I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City" and Randy Newman's "Cowboy". Bob Dylan wrote "Lay Lady Lay" to serve as the theme song, but did not finish it in time.[23] The movie's main theme, "Midnight Cowboy", featured harmonica by Toots Thielemans, but on its album version it was played by Tommy Reilly.[24] The soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records in 1969.[25]. The title music from Midnight Cowboy and some of the incidental ques were included on the high profile political satirical feature documentary ToryBoy The Movie by John Walsh.
