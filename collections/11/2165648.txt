Between 1950 and 1970, Conejo Valley experienced a population boom, and increased its population from 3,000 to 30,000 residents.[52] From 3,500 residents in 1957, Thousand Oaks had over 103,000 inhabitants by 1989.[53] While ranching and agriculture were the dominant industries until the 1950s, a number of new businesses appeared throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Particularly many high-tech firms moved to Thousand Oaks in the 60's and 70's. Packard Bell and Technology Instrument Company were two high-technology businesses that moved into Newbury Park's industrial park in the 1960s. Other companies that followed included Westinghouse Astroelectronics Laboratory, Semtech Corporation, Purolator Inc., and Westland Plastics.[54]
