One musical number shot for the film, but dropped from the final release, was a seductive dance routine featuring Charisse performing "Two-Faced Woman". As with the other Charisse songs, her singing was dubbed by India Adams. Adams' recording of the song was reused for Torch Song (1953) for a musical number featuring Joan Crawford. The retrospective That's Entertainment! III (1994) released the Charisse version to the public for the first time. This footage was also included with the most recent DVD release of The Band Wagon itself.[3]
