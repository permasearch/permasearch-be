Public radio was introduced in New Zealand in 1922.[322] A state-owned television service began in 1960.[323] Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations.[324] New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming, along with a large number of Australian and local shows.[325] The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers and many films attained a world audience, some receiving international acknowledgement.[324] The highest-grossing New Zealand films are Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Boy, The World's Fastest Indian, Once Were Warriors and Whale Rider.[326] The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives,[327] have encouraged some producers to shoot big-budget productions in New Zealand, including Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, King Kong and The Last Samurai.[328] The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies, most of which are foreign-owned, although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations.[329] Since 1994, Freedom House has consistently ranked New Zealand's press freedom in the top twenty, with the 19th freest media in 2015[update].[330]
