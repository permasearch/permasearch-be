At least part of appeal of Austen films in the modern United States is that they deal directly with the subject of class, which American filmmakers generally prefer to avoid.[58] Americans like to see their nation as a meritocracy where everyone regardless of their skin color, sex, and income level is completely equal with exactly the same opportunities in life regardless of who they are, and the suggestion that some Americans might be disadvantaged because of their race, sex and/or income level is a painful one, implying their nation is not living up to its ideals.[59] American filmmakers often avoid confronting the subject of class especially; by contrast the Austen films set in Regency England are far away enough both in time and in geography to raise the subject of class without imposing discomfort on an American audience.[60] Likewise, in Georgian Britain, the only roles possible for a woman in polite society were those of a wife and mother, which means that Austen films can deal starkly with sexism in ways that films set in contemporary times often do not. Irvine noted in Clueless, the characters are only concerned with being “cool”, as there is almost no suggestion in the film of any class, racial and sexual barriers in southern California, circa 1995, as the only social line that matters is the one between "cool" and "uncool".[61] Only with the minor character of the put-upon El Salvadoran maid who works for the Horowitz family, whom Cher keeps calling a "Mexican", does Clueless imply that there might be some inequality in modern America.[62] However, Irvine noted that American audiences cannot entirely embrace the social hierarchy of Georgian England, based as it was on land and birth, and instead the 1996 version of Emma offered up a hierarchy based on consumption and luxury conferred by access to cash, in short a society very much like the modern United States.[63]
