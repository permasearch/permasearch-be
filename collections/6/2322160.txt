Water temperatures in the Arabian Sea are typically warm enough to allow for tropical cyclogenesis year round, although strong wind shear from the monsoon trough prevents formation in the summer months and limits intensity other times of the year. An increase in air pollution since the 1930s caused a decrease in the wind shear, allowing storms to have become stronger since 1979.[10]
