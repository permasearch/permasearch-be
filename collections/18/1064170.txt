For several years, BC's television and radio commercials have featured real-life users of the product, non-actors who are encouraged to submit their stories to BC Powder through contests announced on radio programs. Recently, most entries have been culled from listeners of the Charlotte, NC-based radio program The Big Show with John Boy and Billy. In recent years, members of the Tom Joyner Radio Show's audience have appeared in BC commercials after hearing of the promotion on that program, or from promotions held on Joyner's annual "Fantastic Voyage" fantasy cruise.
