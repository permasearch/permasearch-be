VLANs can also help create multiple layer 3 networks on a single physical infrastructure. For example, if a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is plugged into a switch it will serve any host on that switch that is configured for DHCP. By using VLANs, the network can be easily split up, so some hosts will not use that DHCP server and will obtain link-local addresses, or obtain an address from a different DHCP server.
