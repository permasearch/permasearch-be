The city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, was criticized for mismanagement and waste.[193] During his administration in 1989, The Washington Monthly magazine claimed that the District had "the worst city government in America."[194] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[195] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses.
