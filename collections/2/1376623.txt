Dean Bailey was appointed as coach for the 2008 season, but success did not follow, as Melbourne lost their first six matches, before breaking through with a record comeback win in round seven against Fremantle. They showed signs of improvement, putting up a good fight[according to whom?] in round nine against top-of-the-ladder team Hawthorn, who was undefeated at the time. Melbourne had to wait until round 14 for the second win. After good performances,[vague] against Collingwood, Richmond, and Sydney in the preceding weeks, the Demons defeated Brisbane by a solitary point in the two teams' first encounter at the MCG in nine years.
