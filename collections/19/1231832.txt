Meanwhile, over at Comeback Canyon, former teammates Damien and Jackie are now going head-to-head. Bob believes if anyone can beat NFLer Damien, it's the Queen of Comeback Canyon. Jackie steps on the scale first with a previous weight of 243 pounds. Her current weight is 239, meaning she lost four pounds, or 1.65%. She's happy to have finally made it into the 230s. Damien is up next, with a previous weight of 314. He needs to lose at least six pounds to dethrone Jackie, and loses an impressive eight, or 2.55%. He is psyched to be so close to the 200s, and to stay at Comeback Canyon another week. Jackie is happy to go home a different, stronger, happier person who can't wait to teach her kids a healthier lifestyle.
