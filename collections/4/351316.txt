At first Sanjana cannot stand the enthusiastic and out going Prem, and she plays a series of pranks on him, together with her friends. As they begin to spend more time together, they put their differences aside and eventually fall in love, much to the delight of her parents â€“ who also love Prem. Prem returns to the U.S. for work and promises Sanjana that he will be back soon. Suddenly, however, Roopa informs the family that her friend Prem could not make it so someone else was sent in his place.
