We Bare Bears follows three adoptive bear brothers: Grizzly, Panda and Ice Bear. The bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.[3] However, in the end, they figure out that they have each other for support.[4] One notable aspect of the show's humor is the bears' ability to form a "bear stack". As its name shows, the bears stack on top of each other, which serves as their unique way of transportation.[3] Occasionally, the bears share adventures with their friends, such as child prodigy Chloe, bigfoot Charlie, internet sensation Nom Nom, park ranger Tabes, and produce saleswoman Lucy.
