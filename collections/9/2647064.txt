In September 1989, Jon Bon Jovi and Sambora performed 'Livin' On A Prayer' and 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' with only acoustic guitars on the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance has been acknowledged as the inspiration for the MTV Unplugged series and a catalyst for the subsequent popularity of the unplugged movement in pop music.[37]
