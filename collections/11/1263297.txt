In Hinduism, a murti typically refers to an image or statue which expresses a Divine Spirit (murta). Devotional (bhakti) practices centered on cultivating a deep and personal bond of love with God often include veneration of murtis. Acts of devotion can include awakening the murti in the morning and making sure that it "is scrubbed, clothed, and garlanded."[1] Furthermore, the building of a temple for the murti is considered the highest act of devotion.[1] Some Hindu denominations like Arya Samaj [2] and Brahmo Samaj, however, reject it, equating it with an idol worship.
