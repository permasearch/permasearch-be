Ghost in the Shell was originally scheduled by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for an April 14, 2017, release through their Touchstone Pictures banner.[37][38] The film was part of DreamWorks' distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios, which began in 2009.[39] In April 2015, Disney moved the film's release date in North America to March 31, 2017, with Paramount Pictures handling international distribution.[28][40] However, it was reported in September 2015 that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016.[41] In January 2016, Disney dropped the film from its release slate after DreamWorks' distribution deal with Universal Pictures was finalized in December 2015.[42][43] Disney's distribution rights for the film were transferred completely to Paramount instead of Universal, with Paramount retaining Disney's release date of March 31, 2017.[42] Unusually, the film was not screened for critics before its release.[13]
