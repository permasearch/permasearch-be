The Adriatic Sea is a unique water body in respect of its overall biogeochemical physiognomy. It exports inorganic nutrients and imports particulate organic carbon and nitrogen through the Strait of Otranto—acting as a mineralization site. The exchange of the substances is made more complex by bathymetry of the Adriatic Sea—75% of water flowing north through the strait recirculates at the Palagruža Sill and North Adriatic adds no more than 3 – 4% of water to the South Adriatic.[87] This is reflected in its biogeography and ecology, and particularly in the composition and properties of its ecosystems.[88] Its main biogeographic units are the Northern Adriatic, the Central Adriatic, and the Southern Adriatic.[89]
