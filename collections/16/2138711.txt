These ideas are all born out of what you think certain people should look like. To you, Chinese, Japanese and Koreans look the same with light yellow skin and slit eyes. Arabs and Indians have dark skin and black hair. Although I can often tell a Korean from a Chinese, there are many exceptions so I won't argue although you should know that it's very common to find a dark-skinned Chinese. Indians usually have dark skin but there are many (especially in Manipur) that have typically Mongoloid features. Arabs are Caucasoids who usually have fair skin and light brown hair. Blond hair and blue eyes are also fairly common. The distinction between India and the middle east has blurred slightly especially in Pakistan but this happened relatively recently. Yet, so great is America's influence that they can change how a country views itself thereby making their ideas true. In truth, India is just as much "Asian" as China, Japan, Korea or anything else you might think of.
