The biochemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the age of the universe was only 10 to 17 million years.[24][25] The panspermia hypothesis suggests that microscopic life was distributed  to the early Earth by space dust,[26] meteoroids,[27] asteroids and other small Solar System bodies and that life may exist throughout the universe.[28] The panspermia hypothesis proposes that life originated outside the Earth, but does not definitively explain its origin.
