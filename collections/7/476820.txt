For George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords.[71] During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain.[72] The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife.[73] He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively.[74] Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue.[75] When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.[76]
