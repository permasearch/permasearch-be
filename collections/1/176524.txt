The vast majority of no-hit games are finished by the starting pitcher, but eleven MLB no-hitters have been thrown by a combination of the starting and relief pitchers. The first such combined no-hitter occurred on June 23, 1917, when Ernie Shore of the Boston Red Sox relieved starter Babe Ruth, who had been ejected for arguing with the umpire after walking the first batter of the game. The runner was subsequently caught stealing and Shore retired the next 26 batters without allowing any baserunners. This game was long considered a perfect game for Shore, since he recorded 27 outs in succession; current rules classify it only as a combined no-hitter. Another major league combined no-hitter did not occur until April 30, 1967, when Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles recorded the final out in relief of Steve Barber in a 2â€“1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. The most recent combined no-hitter occurred on September 1, 2014, when the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves 7-0, as Cole Hamels threw 108 pitches through the first six innings; then Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon successively pitched perfect innings to preserve the no-hitter.
