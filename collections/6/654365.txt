The public square Sanam Luang will be used as the cremation ground, where the construction of an elaborate, temporary crematorium was started in early 2017 and was expected to take more than one year to complete.[37] The government granted one billion baht, deducted from central budget, to cover the construction.[38] Once the cremation is over, the crematorium will be torn down.[39]
