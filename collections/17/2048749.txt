The relevance of BI Analytics has brought forth a paradigm shift in assimilating and visualizing huge chunks of data in near real-time manner. The pivot of all good decision making systems is correct, up-to-date and compliant data. Governments not only want transformation of their own country and countrymen, but also expect improved relations and healthy trade across the world. Development should be transformative and continuously evolving. Internal as well as external IT systems should work in tandem with government policies and procedures. Data Analytics has the ability to change the colour and complexion of the world. E-Governance should induce up-to-date information, initiate effective interaction, engage with transparent transaction in compliance with 'rule of law' thus enabling a sustainable transformation model.
