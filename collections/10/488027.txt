Fisher appears again in "The Gamer in the Grease" in season 5, where he has won three free tickets to the premiere of the science fiction film Avatar (in which Joel David Moore, the actor who plays Fisher, has a supporting role). Fisher invites Hodgins and Sweets to attend the premiere, but they must take turns standing in line in order to maintain their position. Fisher ends up missing the movie, as he meets a woman in line and has sex with her in a tent on the sidewalk outside the theater.
