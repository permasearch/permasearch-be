In statistics and probability theory, a tilde placed on top of a variable is sometimes used to represent the median of that variable; thus         y  ~      {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {y} }}}   would indicate the median of the variable      y    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} }  . A tilde over the letter n (       n ~      {\displaystyle {\tilde {n}}}  ) is sometimes used to indicate the harmonic mean.
