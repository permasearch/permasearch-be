The final images were released at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996,[12] and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images,[13] with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some galaxies in the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.[14]
