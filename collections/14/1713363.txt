In March 2017, the FBI arrested 10 Bonanno crime family associates, soldiers and captains after the accused mobsters were alleged to have been involved in a $26 million dollar loansharking, racketeering, armed robbery, illegal gambling and extortion operation over a 17 year period.[37] Highly ranked member Ronald Giallanzo, who is the nephew of capo Vincent Asaro, was among the accused. Prosecutors said that even after Giallanzo was sentenced to prison in 2007 for racketeering that he was still handling the loansharking operation. Prosecutors also mentioned one incident that after a Bonanno crime family associate owed Giallanzo over $250,000, he had beat him until the associate urinated in fear.[38]
