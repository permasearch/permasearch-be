The 2003 festival featured Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beastie Boys, as well as the reunited Iggy Pop and The Stooges, and drew the largest crowd yet, with 60,000 people attending.[29] The event began to develop worldwide interest and began to become nationally known. It was also the first year on-site camping was provided,[30] improving accessibility as a destination music festival for concertgoers. The ticket prices at this time were $75 for one day, and ranged higher to the price of $140 for a two-day pass.[8]
