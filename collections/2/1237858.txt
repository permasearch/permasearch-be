Scrump is Lilo's personal rag doll that she made herself. "She" (as Lilo treats the doll) is a green doll with a large head (which Lilo passes off by pretending that an insect laid eggs in it), mismatching button eyes and navel, an unevenly stitched mouth, and straw "hair" tied together with a pink bow. The doll is seen throughout the franchise, with Lilo often seen holding it for comfort. Stitch does not seem to care much about the doll and occasionally views it negatively, although various merchandise and promotional imagery portray him as loving the doll and is frequently seen interacting with it in such marketing material. Being an inanimate object, "she" does not speak.
