Iowa was expelled from the Big Ten on May 25, 1929. The reasons were officially unstated and university president William Jessup professed not to know why the faculty committee voted to expel the university. Discussions of player compensation and Iowa's inaction on alleged ethics violation appear to have been a main cause.[3]
