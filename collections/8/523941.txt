By this time BMW had launched the 700, a small car with an air-cooled, rear-mounted 697Â cc boxer engine derived from the engine powering the R67 motorcycle. It was available as a 2-door sedan and as a coupe, both versions having been designed by Giovanni Michelotti.[77] There was also a more powerful RS model for racing.[78]
