For end-users the use of MPLS is not visible directly, but can be assumed when doing a traceroute: only nodes that do full ip routing are shown as hops in the path, thus not the MPLS nodes used in between, therefore when you see that a packet hops between two very distant nodes and hardly any other 'hop' is seen in that providers network (or AS) it is very likely that network uses MPLS.
