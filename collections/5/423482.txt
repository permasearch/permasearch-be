Gavin MacLeod, Bernie Kopell and Ted Lange are the only cast members to appear in every episode of the series, including the last three made-for-TV movies. Fred Grandy was in every episode throughout the run of the series, but was not in the last of the TV movies. However, MacLeod was not the captain in the first two TV movies. However, when MacLeod's character was introduced, there was mention of him being "the new captain".
