In 2016, the US Department of Education recognized Poudre School District as a Green Ribbon Schools District Sustainability Awardee, one of just 15 districts across the country to earn the award.[25] The award recognizes the district's success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5,000 tons since 2006,[26] diverting nearly 1,000 tons of waste (the environmental equivalent of planting more than 16,000 trees and letting them grow for a decade),[27] and creating curriculum that teaches the principles of sustainability.[28]
