Stanley is generally friendly toward the trio, but can be very angry if the rent is late. He is also not above exploiting his tenants' fear of raised rents to get chores and favors done. He is told that Jack is homosexual to bypass any objections he might have to a man living with two women. He does not appear to dislike Jack or homosexuals in general, but he does keep his distance whenever Jack gets "too close" to him and sees Jack's supposed homosexuality as a source of amusement and makes several jokes at his expense, often calling Jack "Tinkerbell".
