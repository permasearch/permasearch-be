Having acquired many Strads from Paolo Stradivari, Count Cozio commissioned some replicas of the instruments to Giovanni Battista Guadagnini. Although many features of Strads are present in the copies, they still remain heavily influenced by Guadagnini's workshop principles and represent well the maker's Turin period.
