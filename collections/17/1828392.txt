Banana slugs are detritivores, or decomposers. They process leaves, animal droppings, moss, and dead plant material, and then recycle them into soil humus.[10] They seem to have a fondness for mushrooms, spread seeds and spores when they eat, and excrete a nitrogen rich fertilizer.[10][11] By consuming detritus (dead organic matter) slugs contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles[12] and are an important aspect of the ecosystem.
