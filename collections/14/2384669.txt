In 1982, the CBS Video Club, which had formed the previous year as the CBS Video Library, became part of the Columbia House family.[4] Also, during that same time period, Columbia House and The Cannon Group founded the UK-exclusive mail-order VHS distribution service Videolog. Sony acquired CBS Records, including Columbia House, in 1988, then at 6 million members. Bertelsmann Music Group had recently acquired RCA Records and changed the name of Columbia House's only surviving rival, RCA Music Service (formerly RCA Victor Record Club), to BMG Music Service.
