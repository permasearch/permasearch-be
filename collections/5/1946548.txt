Guest authorship (where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement, also known as gift authorship) and ghost authorship (where the real author is not listed as an author) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct. In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Gerald Schatten who co-authored with Hwang Woo-Suk, the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce,[26] (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception)[27] - and the coauthors with Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n at Bell Laboratories. More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff,[28] then the editor-in-chief of Neuropsychopharmacology, and a well-documented case involving the drug Actonel.[29]
