After both Chelsea and Booker break something in the house, Raven demands that no one call the landlord since she hasn't told them that Chelsea and Levi have moved in the apartment. When Nia and Booker get frustrated cleaning the dishes, they call the landlord Mr. Jablonski to fix the dishwasher against their mother's wishes. When Mr. Jablonski finds out about Chelsea and her son, he raises the rent or else everyone will have to move out by the end of the month. Meanwhile, Nia and Booker hold a yard sale to help their mother and Levi makes friends with their neighbor who turns out to be the apartment's proprietor and Mr. Jablonski's mother.
