The majority of construction costs were tied up in two contracts, which were opened for bidding on 19 December 1952. The first contract was for the substructure, which was awarded to the low bidder of the Ben C. Gerwick, Inc. — Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. Joint Venture for US$14,234,550 (equivalent to $130,200,000 in 2017). The second contract was for the superstructure, which was awarded to the low bidder at US$21,099,319 (equivalent to $193,000,000 in 2017) by a joint venture between Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. — A. Soda & Son — Judson Pacific Murphy Corp.[41] The substructure construction moved rapidly, with an estimated 45% of piers completed approximately a year after the contract was awarded.[1]
