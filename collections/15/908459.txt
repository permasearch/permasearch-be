While the PATH resembles a typical intraurban heavy rail rapid transit system, it is actually under the jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which oversees railroads that are connected to the national railroad infrastructure.[226] PATH used to share trackage with the Pennsylvania Railroad between Hudson interlocking near Harrison and Journal Square. The line also connected to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor near Harrison station and also near Hudson tower. These connections have since been severed (except for one diamond crossing on a siding near the Hudson tower), as the track layout at Hudson interlocking has been modified considerably. However, FRA regulations still apply to the PATH because of the PATH tracks' proximity to Amtrak trackage.[227] The PATH also uses one bridge operated by Amtrak: the Dock Bridge near Newark Penn Station.[228]
