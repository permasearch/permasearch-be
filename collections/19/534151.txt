During its early lifetime, the Game Boy mainly competed with Sega's Game Gear, Atari's Lynx, and NEC's TurboExpress. The Game Boy outsold its rivals and became a significant success.[12] The Game Boy and its successor, the Game Boy Color,[9] have sold over 118 million units worldwide.[6] Upon the Game Boy's release in the United States, its entire shipment of one million units was sold within a few weeks.[13] Production of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color were discontinued in the early 2000s, being replaced by the subsequent Game Boy Advance, released in 2001.[14]
