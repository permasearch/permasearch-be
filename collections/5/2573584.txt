Other beaches are only accessible by private car or boats.  Of the smaller islands, only Culebrita and Luis Pe√±a permit visitors and can be accessible via water taxis from Culebra.  Hiking and nature photography are encouraged on the small islands.  However, activities which would disturb the nature reserves are prohibited, e.g. Camping, Littering and Motor Vehicles.  Camping, however, is allowed on Playa Flamenco throughout the year. Reservations are recommended.[12] Culebra is also a popular destination for scuba divers because of the many reefs throughout the archipelago and the crystal clear waters.
