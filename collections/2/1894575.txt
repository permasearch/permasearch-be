Though not quite matching the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang", the single still did well commercially managing to reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six, counting the 12 weeks spent, on the rap and hip-hop chart of that year's overall ranking. The song features a slowed-down interpolation of Funkadelic's "(Not Just) Knee Deep" as its bassline and features Jewell on vocals and RBX on chorus. An accompanying music video was directed by Dre himself.
