The first season was filmed primary in Atlanta, though required a great deal of coordination with the city to shut down streets and parks for film.[65] Production for subsequent seasons moved mainly to Riverwood Studios (doing business as Raleigh Studios Atlanta), a plot of land approximately 120 acres (0.49Â km2) outside of Senoia, Georgia. Some existing buildings were used here, such as a subdivision that is used by several families that serves as the Alexandria Safe-Zone, while other buildings are constructed as sets, such as the exterior shots of the main Hilltop mansion, the trash heaps used by the Scavengers, or Father Gabriel's church. Sets are torn down when no longer needed; the church, after its use in Season 5, was removed and its spot used for the iconic setting for the first meeting between Rick's group and Negan in Season 7. The property includes sound stages constructed for interior shots, which then may be reused; the interior sets for the prison during Season 3 were reused to serve as the buildings and sets for the Savior's Sanctuary in Season 7.[66][67] In July 2017, AMC purchased the studio lot from Riverwood for $8.25 million.[68]
