"One More Time" is believed to contain a sample of "More Spell on You" by Eddie Johns,[11] but this is uncredited in the Discovery liner notes. Bangalter reportedly denied using any samples for the song.[12] A later report however indicated that sampling "More Spell on You" had been officially approved.[11]
