Another important form of protective mimicry is M端llerian mimicry, discovered by and named after the naturalist Fritz M端ller.[15][16] In M端llerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily[a] constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.[17][18]
