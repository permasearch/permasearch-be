Sometimes the term "Music Row" is used as a metonymous nickname for the music industry as a whole, just as "Madison Avenue" often refers to the advertising industry. In present years, the district has been marked for extensive historical preservation and local as well as national movements to revive itâ€™s rich and vibrant history. A group dedicated to this mission is the Music Industry Coalition.[3][4][5]
