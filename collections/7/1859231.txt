Sky Arts (originally launched as Artsworld) is an art-oriented television channel offering 24 hours a day of programmes dedicated to highbrow arts, including theatrical performances, movies, documentaries and music (such as opera performances and classical and jazz sessions). The channel is available via Sky, Virgin Media, and TalkTalk TV, included in most basic subscription packs, but started life as a premium service requiring an additional payment on top of the monthly Sky subscription.[1] Sky Arts HD is also available on Sky, Virgin Media.
