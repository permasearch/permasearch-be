Canada won the game 3-0 with goals from Jonathan Toews, Sidney Crosby, and Chris Kunitz,[7] each scoring their first goal of the tournament.[8] Canada shut Sweden out with an overpowering defense limiting them to 24 shots, and Canada's goaltender Carey Price played well when needed.[9] The Canadian team's executive director Steve Yzerman called the performance in Sochi the finest defensive effort ever for a Canadian team.[10] Canada shut out its opponents in the semifinals and final and allowed only three goals in six games. It was also the first time since 1928 that a Canadian team won all its games.[8]
