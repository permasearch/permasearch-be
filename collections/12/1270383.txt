A stranger shows up at the gang's isolated hideout, asking to use the phone. To Hank's surprise, Cody introduces the stranger as Daniel "The Trader" Winston, the fence whom Hank has been trying to track down. Cody intends to steal the payroll at a chemical plant in Long Beach, California, by using a large and empty tanker truck as a trojan horse. Hank manages to get a message to Evans and an ambush is laid. The gang get into the plant and makes their way to the payroll office, but as they begin to cut through the safe, the tanker's driver, "Bo" Creel, recognizes Hank as the man who arrested him four years prior.
