Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.288% by mass of the Earth's atmosphere,[19] and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon.[20] The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.[21]
