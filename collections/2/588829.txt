In 2005, he appeared in a Shark Week documentary, Shark Hunter: Chasing the Great White, which was narrated by actor Roy Scheider, who played Martin Brody in Jaws and Jaws II. The special told of Mundus' early career, how he became the inspiration for Quint, his world record capture, and how he turned from shark hunter to shark conservationist. Mundus also joined Chris Fallows and other shark conservationists in viewing great whites in their natural habitat. In one such viewing of the breaching great whites (made famous in the Air Jaws series of specials), during which Fallows brought out a seal decoy he had humorously named "Frank" after Mundus (a hat like the ones Mundus usually wore was even added to it) and they used it to fool them into breaching.
