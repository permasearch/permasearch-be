Michelle Trachtenberg portrays Lisa Willow Tyler in "Weeping Willow," a girl who is kidnapped during the middle of her web show broadcast. The story and the WeepingWillow17 character were inspired by the lonelygirl15 video blogs on YouTube, which were originally believed to be the works of a real-life 15-year-old blogger, but were eventually discovered to be a professionally filmed hoax.
