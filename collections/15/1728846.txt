Federalists such as Hamilton convinced Washington to come out of retirement to run for president in the country's first presidential election. In February 1789, the Electoral College, the mechanism established by the Constitution to conduct the indirect presidential elections, met for the first time. Under the rules then in place, each elector received two votes, with the candidate who won the most votes becoming president and the candidate with the second-most becoming vice president. Each elector cast one vote for Washington, while John Adams won the most votes of all other candidates, and thus won election as vice president. The Federalists performed well in the concurrent Congressional elections, ensuring that the 1st United States Congress would be dominated by proponents of the Constitution.[122] Federalist victories in the elections also ensured that there would not be a constitutional convention to propose amendments, which many Federalists had feared would critically weaken the federal government.[123]
