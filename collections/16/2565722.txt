Contrary to popular belief, the RX-Vision is no more a successor to the RX-8 than the RX-8 is to the RX-7. The only concrete linking factor between these cars are their Wankel engines and the RX nomenclature. In reality, the RX nomenclature is much like BMW's M nomenclature. An M3 is not a predecessor to the -5 or vice versa.
