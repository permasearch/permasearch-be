Internal Combustion engines must have their cycles started.  In reciprocating engines this is accomplished by turning the crankshaft (Wankel Rotor Shaft) which induces the cycles of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.  The first engines were started with a turn of their flywheels, while the first vehicle (the Daimler Reitwagen) was started with a hand crank.  All ICE engined automobiles were started with hand cranks until Charles Kettering developed the electric starter for automobiles.[30]
