tRFs have multiple dependencies and roles. They exhibit significant changes between sexes, among races and disease status.[36] Functionally, they can be loaded on Ago and act through RNAi pathways,[34][36][37][39] participate in the formation of stress granules,[40] displace mRNAs from RNA-binding proteins[41] or inhibit translation.[42] At the system or the organismal level, the four types of tRFs have a diverse spectrum of activities. Functionally, tRFs are associated with viral infection,[43] cancer,[36][37] cell proliferation [38] and also with epigenetic transgenerational regulation of metabolism.[44]
