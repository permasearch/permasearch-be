The geography of the Soviet Union includes the geographic features of the countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Soviet Union was the largest country in the world, covering approximately one sixth of the earth's land surface. It was two and a half times the size of the United States, and only slightly smaller in land area than the entire continent of North America.[1] It covered most of the northern half of Asia and a large part of Eastern Europe, extending even into the Middle East. About one quarter of its territory was in Europe, and the rest in Asia. The territory of the USSR was dominated by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic—having the same borders as contemporary Russia—which covered roughly three quarters of the surface area of the union.
