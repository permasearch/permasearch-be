Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album four out of four stars, saying "Wise Up Ghost” contains some of the most fleshy and smart work of either act’s career. It’s a perfect nexus of talents, reining in Costello’s excesses while giving the Roots a new, literary context."[19] Colin McGuire of PopMatters gave the album an eight out of ten, saying "Some people turn their obsessions into careers, the singer argues at one point during “Stick Out Your Tongue”. Elvis Costello and the Roots? Well, they already have the careers. With Wise Up Ghost, though, they now also have a great album."[20] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times gave the album a positive review, saying "Gather some stones and make them atone," sings Costello on “Come the Meantimes,” a line that captures the essence of “Wise Up Ghost.” A heavy work both thematically and musically, it shows one of the great songwriters of the last three-plus decades at yet another artistic peak. If you've ever fallen in love with a Costello record, be prepared for a new obsession."[21] Nick Coleman of The Independent gave the album four out of five stars, saying "There’s something artificial and experimental in the project’s very DNA, but that need not be a bad thing, and it isn’t."[22]
