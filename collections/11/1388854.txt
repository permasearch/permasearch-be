The Roy Harper song "All Ireland" from the album Lifemask, written in the days following the incident, is critical of the military but takes a long term view with regard to a solution. In Harper's book (The Passions of Great Fortune), his comment on the song ends "â€¦there must always be some hope that the children of 'Bloody Sunday', on both sides, can grow into some wisdom".[120]
