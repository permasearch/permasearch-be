The duchess was born Miss Georgiana Spencer, on 7 June 1757, as the first child of John Spencer (later Earl Spencer) and his wife, Georgiana (nÃ©e Poyntz, later Countess Spencer), at the Spencer family home, Althorp.[3] After her daughter's birth, her mother wrote that "I will own I feel so partial to my Dear little Gee, that I think I never shall love another so well".[4] Two younger siblings followed: Henrietta and George. (The daughter of her sister Henrietta, Lady Caroline Lamb, would become a writer and lover of Lord Byron). Mr John Spencer, great-grandson of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, came from a wealthy English noble family. He built a Spencer family residence at St. James's, London and raised his children there.[5] The parents raised Georgiana and her siblings in a happy marriage which bears no record of there ever having been any extramarital affairs - a rarity in the era.[5] Meanwhile, Georgiana grew to be close to her mother who was said to favour Georgiana over her other children.[4]
