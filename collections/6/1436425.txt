Yeager named his plane after his wife Glennis as a good-luck charm; "You're my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home".[58] Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures.[59] Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey and Sharon).[60]
