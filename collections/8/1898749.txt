Women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) have a high occurrence of ectopic pregnancy.[15] This results from the build-up of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes, causing damage to cilia.[16] If however both tubes were completely blocked, so that sperm and egg were physically unable to meet, then fertilization of the egg would naturally be impossible, and neither normal pregnancy nor ectopic pregnancy could occur. Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) present in Asherman's syndrome can cause ectopic cervical pregnancy or, if adhesions partially block access to the tubes via the ostia, ectopic tubal pregnancy.[17][18][19] Asherman's syndrome usually occurs from intrauterine surgery, most commonly after D&C.[17]  Endometrial/pelvic/genital tuberculosis, another cause of Asherman's syndrome, can also lead to ectopic pregnancy as infection may lead to tubal adhesions in addition to intrauterine adhesions.[20]
