After several days of following Strode, Frank enters Strode's house and finds loose gold fibers on a police uniform.  Frank also finds a bag that contains magazines with Frank, on the cover, news articles about Strode's 12-year-old daughter's murder, and Frank's legal defense of the suspect, who was freed on a technicality. Strode wanted Frank to suffer for freeing the suspect, and he wanted Frank to know what Strode felt. Frank leaves a note for Strode, saying that he will meet at a warehouse. As Strode arrives, a fight ensues, leaving both injured. Frank overcomes his desire kill him, remembering Aurelius’ quote, “The best revenge is to be unlike your enemy,” and he then knocks Strode out.
