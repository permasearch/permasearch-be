The concepts of welfare and pension were put into practice in the early Islamic law[11][not in citation given] of the Caliphate as forms of Zakat (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, since the time of the Rashidun caliph Umar in the 7th century. The taxes (including Zakat and Jizya) collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widowed persons, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058â€“1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred.[11][12] (See Bayt al-mal for further information.)
