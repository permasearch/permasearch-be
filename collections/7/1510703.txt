The main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost with estimates of between $88 billion to $175 billion as well as the limits of current materials science.[2] Existing major tunnels, such as the Channel Tunnel, Seikan Tunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel, despite using less expensive technology than any yet proposed for the transatlantic tunnel, struggle financially.
