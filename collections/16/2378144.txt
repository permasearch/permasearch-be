We first meet Franky when Bea Smith arrives and is shown to her cell. Franky is having sex with Kim Chang in there and afterwards, comes out to talk to Bea. She immediately sees an opportunity in Beaâ€”one of Franky's drug smuggling plans fails, and she coerces Bea to smuggle drugs in for her.  Franky holds up the line for the phones, and implies she can keep doing so, in order to stop Bea from seeing Debbie.[8]
