There wasn't as much poll action as last week, but the surprise was when #20 Colorado beat #12 Washington, 20–14. The tie between #3 Auburn and #5 Tennessee, 26–26, caused their rankings to go down slightly. Top ranked Notre Dame kept their top ranking for at least one more week after topping Purdue, 37–11. The top five teams on the October 1 poll were: Notre Dame, Florida State, Michigan, Virginia, and Auburn.
