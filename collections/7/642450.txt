There is a terrific uproar in 2-C as news arrives that Itoko will be modelling for an art exhibition with the title "Nude". While most of the boys in class are enthralled, Harima and Hanai are uninterested-- until it turns out that Tenma and Yakumo will be "helping" too. Hanai and Harima each make plans to buy the portraits featuring the girls they love before anyone else can see them. However, on arrival at the exhibition it turns out that Tenma and Yakumo are merely acting as assistant museum staff, while Itoko's picture is so stylised as to be unrecognisable. Later, Sara Adiemus wants to promote her local church as an ideal venue for weddings, but has no photographs to put in the brochure. She asks Yakumo to model as a bride, but can find no-one but Hanai to take the role of groom. Harima overhears talk about "Tsukamoto"'s wedding and jumps to the conclusion that Hanai is trying to marry Tenma. He crashes the wedding and gets into a duel with Hanai. They are fairly evenly matched, but since both are occupied with the fight, Sara asks Akira, who has short hair, to act as the groom instead. By the time Harima and Hanai sort out the misunderstanding the photoshoot is long over.
