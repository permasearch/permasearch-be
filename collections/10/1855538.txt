Lara Croft's 1996 debut is often cited as a catalyst for more female leads in video games.[65][130][131] Kaiser Hwang of PlayStation Magazine commented that she "brought girl power" to video games.[71] IGN argued that Croft helped redefine gender in video games by providing a different interpretation of what women could do.[132] Several publications have used her as the standard to which later female video game characters have been compared.[133][134][135] Video game publications like PlayStation Magazine, IGN, Edge, and PlayStation: The Official Magazine have labelled the character a video game and cultural icon.[17][81][83][136][137] Jeremy Smith credits Croft with exposing the Tomb Raider games and video games in general to a wider audience.[99] Computer and Video Games commented that Croft's appearance on the cover of The Face signalled a change in the perception of video games from "geeky" to mainstream.[9] The character is honoured in the British city Derby, previous home to Core Design. In 2007, Radleigh Homes placed a blue plaque for Croft at the site of Core Design's former offices, now a block of flats.[138] The Derby City Council opened a public vote in 2009 to name its new ring road. The winning choice, with 89% of over 27,000 votes, was "Lara Croft Way", and opened in July 2010.[139][140][141]
