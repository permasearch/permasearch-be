In the time following the construction of the dam at Akosombo, there has been a steady decline in agricultural productivity along the lake and the associated tributaries.[5]  The land surrounding Lake Volta is not nearly as fertile as the formerly cultivated land residing underneath the lake, and heavy agricultural activity has since exhausted the already inadequate soils.  Downstream agricultural systems are losing soil fertility without the periodic floodings that brought nutrients to the soil before the natural river flow was halted by the dam.[18]  The growth of commercially intensive agriculture has produced a rise in fertilizer run-off into the river.  This, along with run-off from nearby cattle stocks and sewage pollution, has caused eutrophication of the river waters.[5]  The nutrient enrichment, in combination with the low water movement, has allowed for the invasion of aquatic weeds (Ceratophyllum).  These weeds have become a formidable challenge to water navigation and transportation.[1]
