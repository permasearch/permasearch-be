However, on February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film and Sony releasing a Spider-Man film co-produced by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal. Sony Pictures will continue to own, finance, distribute, and exercise final creative control over the Spider-Man films.[75] The next month, Marvel Entertainment CCO Joe Quesada indicated that the Peter Parker version of the character would be used,[76] which Feige confirmed in April.[77] Feige also stated that Marvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the MCU since at least October 2014.[78] The following June, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal does not allow the character to appear in any of the MCU television series, as it was "very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."[79] In November 2016, Holland revealed that he was signed for "three Spider-Man movies and three solo movies".[80] In June 2017, Holland, Feige and Watts confirmed that a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone in Iron Man 2 (portrayed by Max Favreau) was a young Peter Parker, retroactively making it the introduction of the character to the MCU.[81][82]
