The episode also featured an original score composed by Clint Mansell. Mansell said he was approached by Harris and composed the score around the previously chosen songs, including Belinda Carlisle's. Mansell stated that the "calm electronic" score was influenced by John Hughes movies, as well as the death of his girlfriend over a year before.[19] The episode's full original score was released by Lakeshore Records for downloading and streaming in December 2016.[20]
