On 22 May 2012, the legislation to protect children below 18 years from sexual abuse became a reality with the Lok Sabha passing the bill which was earlier cleared by the Rajya Sabha.[17] Child rights activists have called the bill regressive, however, and teens across the country are generally appalled that according to the bill the minimum age for sexual consent was increased from 16 to 18.[18]
