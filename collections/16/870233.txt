In December 1944, RenÃ©e Lemaire returned to Bastogne to visit her parents, and was trapped when the Germans launched its Ardennes offensive on December 16, 1944.[1]  Along with nurse Augusta Chiwy,[3] she volunteered at an aid station for the American 20th Armored Infantry Battalion on December 21, 1944.[4] In a commendation request from Battalion Surgeon Dr. Jack T. Prior, Lemaire was described as "cheerfully accepted the Herculean task and worked without adequate rest or food...", that she "changed dressings, fed patients unable to feed themselves, gave out medications, bathed and made the patients more comfortable...", and "her very presence among those wounded men seem to be an inspiration to those whose morale had declined from prolonged suffering."[5]
