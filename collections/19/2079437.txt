The Cardinals extended their postseason streak to a fourth consecutive season, winning the National League Central title for a second straight year with a 90â€“72 mark. They also made the NLCS for the fourth time in as many seasons, but like in 2012, they lost to the eventual World Series champions San Francisco Giants, this time in five games.
