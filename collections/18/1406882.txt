The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn and Saturn's large moon, Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a substantial atmosphere, took priority.[4][5][6] It studied the weather, magnetic fields and rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.
