Three semifinalists: Sydney Park, Sideswipe, and Michael Speaks (all of which had televised auditions), did not perform in the semifinals at all. No reason was given for their absence, but in 2007, it was revealed that Sideswipe had to withdraw because of a member's foot injury. Sydney Park was believed to be absent because of her career in acting.
