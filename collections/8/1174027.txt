From the above table, clearly there is a problem with the above theory. All of the diatomics examined have heat capacities that are lower than those predicted by the equipartition theorem, except Br2. However, as the atoms composing the molecules become heavier, the heat capacities move closer to their expected values. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the quantization of vibrational, and to a lesser extent, rotational states. In fact, if it is assumed that the molecules remain in their lowest-energy vibrational state because the inter-level energy spacings for vibration energies are large, the predicted molar constant-volume heat capacity for a diatomic molecule becomes just that from the contributions of translation and rotation:
