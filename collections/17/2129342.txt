After a disappointing performance in a season-opening, 41â€“14 loss to Alabama (27 rushing yards, 200 passing yards, and two interceptions), Robinson rebounded in Michigan's second game against Air Force. Robinson contributed 426 yards of total offense against Air Force (208 passing yards, 218 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and two passing touchdowns). For his performance, he was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week and received College Football Performance Award honors as National Player of the Week and National Quarterback of the Week.[145] He became the first NCAA athlete to both rush and pass for 200 yards in a game on three separate occasions. It marked the first time since the 1993 Rose Bowl performance by Tyrone Wheatley that a Michigan player had two rushing touchdowns of over 50 yards.[145]
