Due to their remoteness from each other, the northern and southern sections of the Carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when Philip Ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1712, Carolina was divided into two colonies: the Province of South Carolina and the Province of North Carolina.
