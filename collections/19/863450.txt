The country's problems were added to by the First League of Armed Neutrality, which was formed to counter the British blockade strategy, and threatened British naval supplies from the Baltic. With severe manpower shortages, North's government passed an act abandoning previous statutes placing restrictions on Catholics serving in the military. This provoked an upsurge of anti-Catholic feelings and the formation of the Protestant Association leading to the Gordon Riots in London in June 1780.[13] For around a week the city was in the control of the mob, until the military was called out and martial law imposed.[14] In spite of these problems Great Britain's fortunes in the war in America had temporarily improved, following the failure of a Franco-American attack on Newport and the prosecution of a Southern Strategy which saw Great Britain capture Charleston and its garrison. During 1780 and 1781 the North government gained strength in the House of Commons.[15]
