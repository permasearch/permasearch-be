Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball's most powerful characters with small statures.[8] He later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his editor was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[9] The reason there are many anthropomorphic characters is simply that he finds it easier to make them look different if they are animals rather than humans.[10] For the female characters, Toriyama created women he deemed "beautiful and sexy", but also "strong".[8] He did however state that he has trouble drawing females and this is the reason there are very few women in Dragon Ball.[5] During the second half of the series, Toriyama placed less emphasis on the imagery, simplifying the lines and sometimes making things "too square"; found problems determining the colors; and sometimes altered them mid-story.[3]
