In October 1905 La mer, Debussy's most substantial orchestral work, was premiered in Paris by the Orchestre Lamoureux under the direction of Camille Chevillard;[6] the reception was mixed. Some praised the work, but Pierre Lalo, critic of Le Temps, hitherto an admirer of Debussy, wrote, "I do not hear, I do not see, I do not smell the sea".[72][n 12] In the same month the composer's only child was born at their home.[49] Claude-Emma, affectionately known as "Chouchou", was a musical inspiration to the composer (she was the dedicatee of his Children's Corner suite). She outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919.[74] Mary Garden said, "I honestly don't know if Debussy ever loved anybody really. He loved his music â€“ and perhaps himself. I think he was wrapped up in his genius", [75] but biographers are agreed that whatever his relations with lovers and friends, Debussy was devoted to his daughter.[76][77][78]
