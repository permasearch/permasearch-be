The cartoon series was also remarkable because it was one of the first animated series produced directly for syndication, as opposed to most other syndicated cartoons of the time which were re-runs of old Saturday morning cartoons. The most notable production fact of the series was that it was the very first animated series where a bulk quantity of 65 episodes were produced so that the series could be stripped across 13 weeks.[31] Writers on the show included Larry DiTillio, David Wise, Ron Schultz, Sam Schultz, Marc Scott Zicree, Robby London, Michael Reaves, J. Brynne Stephens, Robert White, Don Heckman, Douglas Booth, Rowby Goren, Tom Tataranowicz, Robert Lamb, Antoni Zalewski, Jeffry O'Hare, and many others. The series is also noted for featuring early script-writing work from Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, and Paul Dini of Batman: The Animated Series fame[35] One episode, "Battle Cat," was written by Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.
