Luigi Galvani did pioneering research on the effects of electricity on the body in the late 1700s, and laid the foundations for the field of electrophysiology.[51] In the 1800s Michael Faraday discovered that an electrical current had a corresponding magnetic field, and that changing one, could change the other.[52] Work to directly stimulate the human brain with electricity started in the late 1800s, and by the 1930s electroconvulsive therapy has been developed by Italian physicians Cerletti and Bini.[51] ECT became widely used to treat mental illness and became overused as it began to be seen as a "psychiatric panacea", and a backlash against it grew in the 1970s.[51] Around that time Anthony T. Barker began exploring use of magnetic fields to alter electrical signalling in the brain, and the first stable TMS devices were developed around 1985.[51][52] They were originally intended as diagnostic and research devices, and only later were therapeutic uses explored.[51][52] The first TMS devices were approved by the FDA in October 2008.[51]
