"Yankee" has also greatly influenced the premier Soviet sci-fi writers, Strugatsky Brothers, and their two seminal books.  In humorous Monday Begins on Saturday Merlin's character is taken entirely from the Mark Twain's book, and he often references it.  Hard to Be a God is essentially a remake of "Yankee," concentrating on the moral and ethical questions of "civilizing the uncivilized."  Its ending is almost identical to "Yankee":  both main protagonists crumble under the weight of dead bodies of those they tried to civilize.
