The number of players on a major league roster is dictated by the labor agreements worked out between players and management. According to the current[when?] rules, a team may have a maximum of 25 men on a roster from Opening Day until August 31. Beginning in the 2012 season, a major league team is allowed to carry a 26th man on its roster when playing the second game of a double-header that was scheduled at least 48 hours in advance.
