An Atlanta Constitution editorial dated February 20, 1942, stated that: “The time to stop taking chances with Japanese aliens and Japanese-Americans has come. . . . While Americans have an inate distaste for stringent measures, every one must realize this is a total war, that there are no Americans running loose in Japan or Germany or Italy and there is absolutely no sense in this country running even the slightest risk of a major disaster from enemy groups within the nation.”[75]
