Many nations require some form of voter identification at the polling place, but specific details of the requirement vary widely.[121] In Spain, Greece, France, Belgium, and Italy, a government-issued photo ID is required to cast a ballot.[121] However, all citizens in these nations are automatically provided with a photo ID upon reaching adulthood. Mexico has a similar system, with all registered voters receiving a photo ID upon completing the registration process.[121] Several Western democracies do not require identification for voting, such as Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[121] In Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland, poll workers reserve the right to request identification but are not required to do so.[121] In Canada, identification is required, but voters can provide any two forms of ID from a list of 45 possibilities. Canada’s system is more stringent than the 17 U.S. states that do not require ID but less stringent than the 22 U.S. states with strict requirements. The strict Indiana ID system, for instance, accepts only five forms of ID: an Indiana driver’s license, an Indiana ID card, a military ID, a US passport, or a student ID card from an in-state college or university.[121] Conversely, some countries, like Australia, require no form of identification at any election.[122] This position is similar to the situation in New York and California.
