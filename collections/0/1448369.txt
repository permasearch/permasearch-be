There is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are a large number of narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number – somewhere between five and ten – of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, g, the general factor common to all tests.[37][38][39] The g factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries.[40] Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the three stratum theory and the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory.[41]
