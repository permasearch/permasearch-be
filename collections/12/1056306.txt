The novel was well received by critics who praised its humor and ostensibly satirical content.[8][9] In The Guardian, Elisabeth Donnelly described it as "a masterful work that establishes Beatty as the funniest writer in America",[10] while reviewer Reni Eddo-Lodge called it a "whirlwind of a satire", going on to say: "Everything about The Selloutâ€™s plot is contradictory. The devices are real enough to be believable, yet surreal enough to raise your eyebrows."[11]
