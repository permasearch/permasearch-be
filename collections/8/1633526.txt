Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani,[1] which is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure.[2] The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.[2] They produce toxins that interfere with muscle contractions, resulting in the typical symptoms.[3] Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms.[1] The disease does not spread between people.[1]
