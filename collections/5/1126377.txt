In vertebrates that can synthesize ascorbic acid, the biosynthesis pathway starts with glucose, either taking place in the liver for mammals and some birds, or the kidneys for amphibians, reptiles and some birds.[124] The pathway is the same. Several enzymes catalyze steps from D-glucose to D-glucuronate. Next, the enzyme glucuronate reductase converts D-glucuronate to L-gluconate. Then the enzyme gulonolactonase converts L-gluconate to L-gulonolactone. The final enzymatic conversion is by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO), to 2-keto-gulonolactone. From this compound, the last step is a spontaneous, i.e., non-enzymatic conversion to ascorbic acid (vitamin C). GLO is the enzyme that is absent in animal species unable to synthesize vitamin C.[94]
