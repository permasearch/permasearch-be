Employees in certain cases of either involuntary separation, or voluntary separation during a "reduction in force" can qualify for early retirement. The employee must either have 25 years of service at any age, or 20 years of service and be age 50. Disability retirement is also a potential option for eligible federal employees with at least 18 months of service who no longer can perform their duties due to a medical disability.[5]
