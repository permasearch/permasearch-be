Owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, low number of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells.[5] Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.[51][52][53]
