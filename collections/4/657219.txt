Born in Burma, Michie was brought up in Kenya until he was 12, when his family settled in Edinburgh, later sending him to study at college.[1] At the age of 19, he worked his passage to Australia on a cargo ship, where he spent a year as a jackaroo herding cattle before moving to Scotland. He took a job as a stage hand at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, where his interest in acting started. He returned to Kenya when he was 22, beginning his acting career in A Private Matter at the Donovan Maule Theatre, Nairobi in 1980.
