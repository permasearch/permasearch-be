The company markets the Museum Watch, designed by the American designer Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. It was first manufactured by Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc., Switzerland. Movado started producing an unauthorized version starting in 1948, copying Horwitt's design. It was added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in 1960. Movado finally settled with Horwitt in 1975 with a payment of $29,000 ($128,000 in 2015 dollars). Following Horwitt's death, Movado started heavy promotion of Horwitt and the design of the Museum Watch.[1][4][5] Photographer Edward Steichen called Horwitt's design "the only truly original and beautiful one for such an object".
