Leeds United are considered to be the club's main rival, with Huddersfield having the better head-to-head record of the two teams. Huddersfield have won 25 of the 61 derbies between the two sides with 17 draws and 19 Leeds wins.[3] Huddersfield's other local rivals are Bradford City; this is due to both clubs having had roughly the same league status for the last couple of decades and therefore it could be argued that they are closest rivals out of the three West Yorkshire teams.
