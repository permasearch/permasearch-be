At this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, he would not be able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.[21] Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.[5][22] The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America,[23] partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery.[24] Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.[5] He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script.[5] Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.[25]
