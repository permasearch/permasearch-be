Unemployment hit record heights in Newcastle during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The city's last coal pit closed in 1956,[50] though a temporary open cast mine was opened in 2013.[51] The temporary open cast mine shifted 40,000 tonnes of coal, using modern techniques to reduce noise, on a part of the City undergoing redevelopment.[51] The slow demise of the shipyards on the banks of the River Tyne happened in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
