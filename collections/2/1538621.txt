Interpersonal conflict among people at work has been shown to be one of the most frequently noted stressors for employees.[15][16] Conflict has been noted to be an indicator of the broader concept of workplace harassment.[17] It relates to other stressors that might co-occur, such as role conflict, role ambiguity, and workload. It also relates to strains such as anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of job satisfaction.[17]
