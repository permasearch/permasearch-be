The official FDIC teller sign, posted at every U.S. insured bank and savings association, states that FDIC deposit insurance is "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government." The FDIC describes this sign as a symbol of confidence for depositors.[49] As part of a 1987 legislative enactment, Congress passed a measure stating "it is the sense of the Congress that it should reaffirm that deposits up to the statutorily prescribed amount in federally insured depository institutions are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States."[50]
