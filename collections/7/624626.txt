In May 2018, it was announced that Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, the writers and directors of Lost in La Mancha, would release a follow-up film, titled He Dreamed of Giants, which would cover the entire history of the film's making, with particular focus on what happened after the events depicted in Lost in La Mancha.[106][107] Pepe said that the film would be "more introspective" than Lost in La Mancha, stating, "This is more a film about an internal struggle in an artist's mind. What is it like for an artist to be standing on the brink of actually finishing this project finally? [...] Even on the set we would say the conflicts raging around Terry right now of making the movie are not nearly as interesting as what's going on inside his head."[108][109]
