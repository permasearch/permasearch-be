On appeal, Criner claimed that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of rape and insufficient to prove that he was responsible for the aggravating element, i.e. the head injury to Ogg.[25][28][29] A divided panel of the intermediate appellate court agreed with his second claim and thus did not rule on his first one.[28][30] A divided Court of Criminal Appeals reversed,[31] and the conviction became final.[32]
