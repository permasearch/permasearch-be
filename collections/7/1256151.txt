As the weather cools in the fall, barren-ground and Porcupine caribou leave their summer grounds forming large herds and migrate south for the winter. They start mating when large lakes were frozen over. Just prior to mating, the males of both caribou are in prime condition, fat and ready to battle for mates. Bulls at this time are more aggressive and they are usually alone.[36]
