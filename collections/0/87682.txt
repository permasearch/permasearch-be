In the New Thought philosophy , the law of attraction is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.[1][2] The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from "pure energy", and that through the process of "like energy attracting like energy" a person can improve their own health, wealth and personal relationships.
