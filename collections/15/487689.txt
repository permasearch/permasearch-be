Corey Clark was also disqualified from the show because, according to the Idol producers, Clark had a police record he had not disclosed to the show.  However, in 2005, contestant Corey Clark alleged in an interview on ABC's Primetime Live and in a book, They Told Me to Tell the Truth, So... The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America's Idols, that he and judge Paula Abdul had an affair while he was on the show and that this contributed to his removal.[29] Clark also alleged that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show and tips on song choice.  A subsequent investigation by an independent counsel hired by Fox "could not corroborate the evidence or allegations provided by Mr. Clark or any witnesses".[30]  Paula Abdul was therefore considered exonerated but an "enhanced non-fraternization policy" was put in place after the investigation.[30]
