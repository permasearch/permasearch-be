N. Sundarajan states that the astrological factors required for success in politics are the strong lagna, the 5th house, the 10th house and the 4th house and their respective lords; a combination or association or aspect between these four factors (as was in the case of Jawaharlal Nehru), and failure results only when they are weak and mutually unconnected but occupy the evil trika-bhavas or associate with the trika-lords in the Rasi-chart or Navamsa-chart (as was in the case of Morarji Desai). Citing Kumarswamiam he states that the person will be a ruler if the lords of lagna and the 5th aspect the lord of the sign occupied by Mercury or if the lord of the 4th and the 10th or 4th and the 11th exchange signs and Jupiter as the lord of lagna is in the 9th house.[41]
