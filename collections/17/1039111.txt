The score was composed by Takanori Arisawa. Three pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; one opening theme and two closing themes. The opening theme for the whole season is "Moonlight Densetsu" (ムーンライト伝説, Mūnraito Densetsu, lit. "Moonlight Legend") performed by the idol group DALI.[13] "Heart Moving", performed by Misae Takamatsu of Sakura Sakura, is used as the ending theme for the first 26 episodes,[13] and "Princess Moon", performed by Ushio Hashimoto, is used for the remainder of the season.[14] DIC Entertainment made an English-language version of the Japanese opening theme for its adaptation.[15]
