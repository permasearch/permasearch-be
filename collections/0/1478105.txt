Verdi's chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera Nabucco is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)â€”the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.[citation needed]
