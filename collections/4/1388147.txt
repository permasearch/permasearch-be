The final round was staged on a platform that was 100 feet (30Â m) above water. As in the preliminary rounds, an educated guess question is asked, and the closest to the number is first. Unlike the early rounds, only one answer is correct, and the others are wrong (An example being "According to Box Office Mojo, what movie sold the most tickets in the USA?" chosen among Star Wars, Titanic, Avatar and Gone with the Wind.) The three incorrect answer choosers are dropped into the water, and the person who remains (choosing Gone with the Wind) won the US $50,000 grand prize. Each episode features a different way in which the contestants fall into the water (apart from the first episode and the last episode where the way of falling is the same).
