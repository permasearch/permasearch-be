In June 1992, the Office of the Dean of the College of Medicine was set up in preparation for its opening in school year 1993-1994. Dr. Gilbert Gamez, erstwhile Dean of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Medicine, was appointed as the first dean of the college. As the university programs expand, a university-wide reorganization was undertaken in July 1992.
