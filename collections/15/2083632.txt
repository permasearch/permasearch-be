The corporate friend hangs up and walks down the street. He lists his accomplishments and they are shown in the video before he stops in front of the same tower that appeared in the beginning of the video. He looks up at it. In the next scene he is completing a transaction with a man in a board room. A graph, clearly of profits, zigzags up a board with the corporate logo on it before ending in what looks like a spatter of blood. The camera zooms out and we see that he was inside the tower. He then gives a speech behind a podium which is broadcast on television. The background changes from the original corporate image into two American flags. The other friend sees it and shakes his head disappointedly.
