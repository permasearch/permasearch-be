After being expelled from Juilliard School, Charlie moved back to Los Angeles with the intention of becoming a film composer. He met a commercial producer who listened to Charlie's work and thus, Charlie began his career writing jingles for a living. His most famous composition is the Maple Loops song. Charlie then became a successful composer and singer of children's music, with the alias "Charlie Waffles", when the jingle business dried up. He can be frequently seen playing the Steinway grand piano in his living room; said piano was later removed from the house by Walden Schmidt after his death. The character of Charlie Harper is loosely based on its actor Charlie Sheen.
