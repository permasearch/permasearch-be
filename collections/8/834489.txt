With regard to gene therapy, ITRs seem to be the only sequences required in cis next to the therapeutic gene: structural (cap) and packaging (rep) proteins can be delivered in trans.  With this assumption many methods were established for efficient production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors containing a reporter or therapeutic gene.  However, it was also published that the ITRs are not the only elements required in cis for the effective replication and encapsidation.  A few research groups have identified a sequence designated cis-acting Rep-dependent element (CARE) inside the coding sequence of the rep gene.  CARE was shown to augment the replication and encapsidation when present in cis.[27][28][29][30]
