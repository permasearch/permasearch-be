Elvis Presley recorded the song[30] and it was included in his first RCA album Elvis Presley March 23, 1956. Presley's version uses "A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!" for every verse,[30] finishing the phrase with "bam-boom" instead of "bom-bom." Elvis' cut of "Tutti Frutti" was also released as an EP and as a single (RCA 47-6636) where it was listed by Billboard magazine as in the Top 20 in sales.
