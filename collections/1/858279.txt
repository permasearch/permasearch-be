When sweeteners are provided for restaurant customers to add to beverages such as tea and coffee, they are often available in paper packets that can be torn and emptied. In North America, the colors are typically white for sucrose, blue for aspartame, pink for saccharin,[note 1] yellow for sucralose (United States) or cyclamate (Canada), tan for turbinado, orange for monk fruit extract, and green for stevia.[2]
