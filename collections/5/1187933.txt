In particulate foods, the particles heat up faster than the liquid matrix due to the higher resistance to electricity.[9] This prevents overheating of the liquid matrix while the particles receive sufficient heat processing.[9] Below are some examples of different electrical conductivity values of certain foods to display composition and salt concentration affect electrical conductivity.
