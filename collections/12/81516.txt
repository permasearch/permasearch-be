After spending six weeks tracking the transformed Dean – along with a brief confrontation with a man named Cole whose father was killed by Dean on a prior hunt – Sam manages to capture Dean while he is distracted, taking him back to the bunker to treat him with the demon cure. Despite demon-Dean's attempts to undermine his and Sam's relationship through his demonically-warped perspective, Sam is eventually able to cure Dean and restore him to humanity, although he continues to be concerned about Dean's emotional state after his time as a demon and the possibility that the Mark of Cain could transform him again.
