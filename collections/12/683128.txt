Pam Puckett (Jane Lynch) is the mother of Sam Puckett and her sister Melanie. Pam appears only in "iSam's Mom". She was frequently mentioned throughout the first three seasons, but had never been seen in person. Whenever Sam mentioned her, it was either something negative, or something disturbing and gross. She is described as "poor", "desperate", and "hostile". Generally, she is indeed hostile to Sam, in which, Sam is hostile in the same manner. It is shown in "iSam's Mom" that she is somewhat desperate since she asks a stranger if he would like to marry her. She likes Melanie more than Sam, seeing the highly noticeable difference between the two. This gets on Sam's nerves when she compares her to Melanie, which causes another argument. She is known for her "frequent dating" (something mentioned by Sam in nearly every episode) and "driving issues", as shown in "iMust Have Locker 239". It is also revealed that she has a love interest for Italian men, as mentioned by Sam in "iGot a Hot Room". At the end of "iSam's Mom", Sam and her mother make up and reconcile their differences. She reappears onscreen in the episode "iShock America" wearing a bikini, but only the lower-half of her body is seen and she has no dialogue.
