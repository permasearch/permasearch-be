RCA quickly moved to expand its broadcasting activities. In the fall of 1921 it set up its first fulltme broadcasting station, WDY, at the Roselle Park, New Jersey company plant. By 1923 RCA was operating three stationsâ€”WJZ (now WABC) and WJY in New York City, and WRC (now WTEM) in Washington, D.C. A restriction imposed by AT&T's interpretation of the patent cross-licensing agreements required that the RCA stations remain commercial free, and they were financed by profits from radio equipment sales.
