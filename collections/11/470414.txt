In Book 4, Kendra is believed to be dead after a clone of her, grown from a very rare plant called a sting bulb, dies. She is kidnapped by a Lectoblix in Illinois, where she is forced to place her hand onto a magical artifact called the Oculous, which allows her to see anything and everything. Unfortunately, it nearly drives her insane. When Kendra is recovered with the help of an unknown ally, she and a couple others go to the death trap known as Wyrmroost, a magical Dragon Sanctuary. There, she meets many dangerous dragons, but among the fear-inducing creatures, she meets a friendly dragon named Raxtus, who saves them often. Although the dragon assists her to some extent, she also encounters dangers she had never dreamed of. She goes through bitter betrayal, comrade's deaths, and the loss of a dear friend. Kendra returns home along with the rest of the team, and she is barely comforted by her grandparents. She feels betrayed and will only allow her trust to reside in one person: her brother. Kendra understood what Patton knew to be true while further hiding the artifacts: In a world of traitors, who can you trust? With spies lurking around each corner, how can you confide in anyone? Kendra feels terrible already after a terrifying experience at Wyrmroost, and she arrives back to her home at Fablehaven to hear worse news yet.
