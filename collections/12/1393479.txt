The X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a pair of identical chromosomes,[14][15] termed autosomes, when an ancestral animal developed an allelic variation, a so-called "sex locus" â€“ simply possessing this allele caused the organism to be male.[16] The chromosome with this allele became the Y chromosome, while the other member of the pair became the X chromosome. Over time, genes that were beneficial for males and harmful to (or had no effect on) females either developed on the Y chromosome or were acquired through the process of translocation.[17]
