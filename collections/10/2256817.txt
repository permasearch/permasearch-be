Requirements are prone to issues of ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency.  Techniques such as rigorous inspection have been shown to help deal with these issues.  Ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies that can be resolved in the requirements phase typically cost orders of magnitude less to correct than when these same issues are found in later stages of product development.  Requirements analysis strives to address these issues.
