Nahyo M. Kim of The New York Times wrote that in a period around 10 years before 2010, Brockton High "was a case study in failure" everyone just kept failing for no apparent reason.[4] At that time the school's unofficial motto was "students have a right to fail if they want".[4] Around 1999 the school set up a reform plan, using the skill areas of reading, reasoning, speaking, and writing and using them in the school's curriculum. By 2001 student performance improved. Susan Szachowicz, the former principal, said that the school culture and large size was crucial to the school's turnaround. This occurred in a period when education advocates promoted small schools.[7]
