In 2012, Sebastian Seung and his laboratory at MIT have launched EyeWire, an online Citizen science game where players trace neurons in the retina.[68] The goals of the EyeWire project are to identify specific cell types within the known broad classes of retinal cells, and to map the connections between neurons in the retina, which will help to determine how vision works.[69][70]
