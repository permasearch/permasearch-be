Dean Moriarty (Daniel Samonas; seasons 2 and 4) is Alex's boyfriend in the second season. He makes temporary tattoos in the boys bathroom and is interested in cars. In episode "Racing" he charmed Alex's parents with his car skills, though he revealed to Alex that he only did it to make a good first impression by being polite. It is also revealed in that episode, that he was raised by his Uncle, as he exclaimed proudly "my Uncle raised me with manners". Harper and Justin aren't too fond of him and Jerry seems the same way later on, though this is partly due to Jerry being an overprotective father after learning that he is dating Alex. He can never remember Harper's name. In the episode "Alex's Brother Maximan" it was shown he likes roller skating and playing with the claw game and winning stuffed animals. The only thing Alex doesn't like about him is that he's horrible at showing his feelings, as shown in "Saving Wiz Tech Part 1", but it changed in "Saving Wiz Tech Part 2". He does not appear to be academically inclined, as Alex noticed a false good grade on his wooden assignment/gift for her (it was a D changed to a B), and he also stated that he does not "test well", meaning he doesn't see himself as book-smart. He moved away sometime after that, so Alex visited him in his dreams in "Wizards vs Vampires: Dream Date"; she then saw how they were growing apart, so they broke up. But he returned in Season 4 "Journey to the Center of Mason" because he wanted to get back together, though she denied it because she likes Mason, and Mason eats him out of jealousy. Dean is later rescued by Alex, Justin, and Max, and learns that Alex has chosen Mason and agrees to back off.
