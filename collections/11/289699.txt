One transnational group whose ideology was based specifically on restoring the caliphate as a pan-Islamic state is Hizb ut-Tahrir (literally, "Party of Liberation"). It is particularly strong in Central Asia and Europe and is growing in strength in the Arab world. It is based on the claim that Muslims can prove that God exists[93] and that the Qur'an is the word of God.[94][95] Hizb ut-Tahrir's stated strategy is a non-violent political and intellectual struggle.
