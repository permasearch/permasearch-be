Certain people are Wakan, or "blessed" in Lakota as medicine men or women with spiritual roles in the community. The buffalo is particularly sacred to many of the Plains peoples; their horns and hides are sometimes used as sacred regalia during ceremony.[9] In Plains cosmology, certain items possess spiritual or talismanic power. Medicine bundles are particularly sacred and are only entrusted to specialized bundle keepers. Other items with great spiritual power include war shields, war shirts, and ceremonial pipes, many of which have been cared for by tribes for centuries.[citation needed]
