UEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals because UEFA did not allow Yugoslavia to participate as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[35][36] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[37] then defeated world champion Germany 2â€“0.[38] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.
