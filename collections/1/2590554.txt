The Tompkins Table is an annual ranking that lists the Colleges of the University of Cambridge in order of their undergraduate students' performances in that year's examinations. It was created in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, then a third-year undergraduate mathematics student at Trinity College, who until 2015 compiled it every year exclusively for the newspaper The Independent.[1] In 2016, it was published by Varsity, a student newspaper of the University of Cambridge.[2] It is not an official University of Cambridge table. Assuming it is based on published Class Lists, it will not take account of students who are not candidates for Honours degrees, or those who have failed to gain a degree, or those whose names the Council have determined should be withheld from public display.[3]
