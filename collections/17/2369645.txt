Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy,[53] derived features of and episodes about Bolgia[54] from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology:[55][56] the Hadith and the Kitab al-Miraj (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before[57] as Liber Scale Machometi[58]) concerning the ascension to Heaven of Muhammad,[59] and the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi.[60] The Moors also had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William Shakespeare. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's The Battle of Alcazar and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Titus Andronicus and Othello, which featured a Moorish Othello as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan England at the beginning of the 17th century.[61]
