On July 15, 2010, repaving of the track began. This came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the 2010 Daytona 500. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons[vague] of asphalt to repave 1,400,000 square feet (130,000Â m2) including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.[10]
