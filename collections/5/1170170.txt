Before the vote, there were calls for the bills to be separated at the Diet. Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that Kimigayo is a separate issue more complex than the Hinomaru flag.[57] Attempts to designate only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet.[58] The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote.[59] The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.[60]
