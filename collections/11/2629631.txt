Mies was born March 27, 1886 in Aachen, Germany.[2] He worked in his father's stone carving shop[2] and at several local design firms before he moved to Berlin, where he joined the office of interior designer Bruno Paul.[3] He began his architectural career as an apprentice at the studio of Peter Behrens from 1908 to 1912,[4] where he was exposed to the current design theories and to progressive German culture, working alongside Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, who was later also involved in the development of the Bauhaus. Mies served as construction manager of the Embassy of the German Empire in Saint Petersburg under Behrens.[5]
