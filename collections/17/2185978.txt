Who saw the towns of many men, much knowledge did obtain Anent their ways, and with much woe was heart-wrung on the main, Seeking his own life to preserve, his friends' return to gain. E'en so he rescued not his friends, though eagerly he strove, For them their own infatuate deeds to direful ending drove. Fools, who the sun-god's sacred beeves dared madly to devour, Doomed by his anger ne'er to see of glad return the hour. Sing, goddess, child of mighty Jove, of these events, I pray, And from what starting-point thou wilt begin with me the lay.
