Following the ceremony to honour Michael, John tells Charlie that he remembers seeing a person in a Fredbear costume on the day of Michael’s death, suspecting the stranger murdered him. That night, Charlie and co. return to the restaurant, further accompanied by friends Lamar, Marla, and her younger brother Jason. Charlie encounters one of the animatronics, Foxy the Pirate, who she was terrified of as a child. Charlie recalls how Henry used to own another restaurant in New Harmony, named Fredbear’s Family Diner.
