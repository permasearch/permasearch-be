The job of leading the foreign language productions of Hair was given to Bertrand Castelli, Butler's partner and executive producer of the Broadway show.[44] Castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau. Butler described him as a "crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads".[45] Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English.[44] The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used. Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities. Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions.[44] The first European production opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968, with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg, Kisa Magnusson, Bill Öhrström and Bruno Wintzell,[46] produced and directed by Pierre Fränckel[47] and choreographed by Julie Arenal,[48] and ran for 134 performances until March 1969.[49]
