October 20, 2010 Billy Nershi announced that "[They're] also planning on doing something next summer at the Rothbury site. That will be a weekend festival with a lot of String Cheese sets. It'll be different from Rothbury in that it will be more like our thing at Horningâ€™s, where String Cheese plays every night, and it will include bands in [The] String Cheese family with art installations and that kind of thing"[9]
