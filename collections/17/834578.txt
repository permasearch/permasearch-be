No. 3 RAF Police Wing provides deployable and specialist support worldwide.  It incorporates No.1 Tactical Police Squadron (TPS) (formerly the Tactical Provost Wing) which forms the RAF Police's tactical, deployable capability; their primary role is to conduct forward policing and security of RAF personnel and assets. The Tactical Police Squadron, augmented by RAF Police personnel from various RAFP formations, have deployed personnel on operations around the world.  The Special Investigation Branch, named as SIB(North) and SIB(South) have transferred to No 3 Specialist Police Wing. In addition, 3 Police Wing includes all RAF Police Reserves, 3 Tactical Police Squadron and 603 (City of Edinburgh) Royal Auxiliary Air Force Squadron. 3 RAF Police Wing moved to RAF Honington in 2015 to provide a single hub for RAF Force Protection.[7][8]
