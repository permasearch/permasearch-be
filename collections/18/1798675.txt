Beginning with Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), the Thirteenth Amendment did experience a kind of renaissance as the constitutional basis for civil rights legislation first passed in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Thirteenth Amendment that the Jones Court seemed to rediscover, however, bore no resemblance, and did not originate in, the racelabor practice of the Civil Rights Section in the 1940s.
