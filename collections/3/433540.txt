The Christian theologian John Gill notes that Jemima may mean either "day" or "dove", the latter by association with the Arabic word يمامة yamāmah. Noting that there is a land in Arabia with the name al-Yamama, which had a queen called Zarqāʼ al-Yamāmah, he conjectures that the Biblical Jemima may be connected with the Yamamah of Arabic folklore.[5]
