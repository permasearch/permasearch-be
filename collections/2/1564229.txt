Inspired by the example of Les Six in France, Copland sought out contemporaries such as Roger Sessions, Roy Harris, Virgil Thomson, and Walter Piston, and quickly established himself as a spokesman for composers of his generation.[52] He also helped found the Copland-Sessions Concerts to showcase these composers' chamber works to new audiences.[53] Copland's relationship with these men, who became known as "commando unit" was one of both support and rivalry, and he played a key role in keeping them together until after World War II.[54] He was also generous with his time with nearly every American young composer he met during his life, later earning the title, "Dean of American Music."[55]
