Some of the more infamous atrocities include the Chios Massacre, the Constantinople Massacre, the Destruction of Psara, the massacres following the Tripolitsa Massacre, and the Navarino Massacre. There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed Orlov Revolt of 1770 and the destruction of the Sacred Band[215]) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.[216]
