The Wii MotionPlus features a pass-through External Extension Connector, allowing other expansions such as the Nunchuk or Classic Controller to be used simultaneously with the device. The attachment has a color-coded mechanical slide switch for locking the clip release. When attached to the (original, non-MotionPlus) Wii Remote, the add-on unit extends the length of the controller body[18] by approximately 1.5 in (4 cm).[19][needs update] Each Wii MotionPlus includes a longer version of the Wii Remote Jacket to accommodate the added length.[12] However, the newer Wii Remote Plus includes the MotionPlus functionality without any extra length.
