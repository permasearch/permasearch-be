A calorie or calory (archaic) is a unit of energy. Various definitions exist but fall into two broad categories. The first, the small calorie, or gram calorie (symbol: cal), is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere.[1] The second, the large calorie or kilogram calorie (symbols: Cal, kcal), also known as the food calorie and similar names,[2] is defined as the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram (rather than a gram) of water by one degree Celsius. It is equal to 7003100000000000000â™ 1,000 small calories.[1]
