Ghost Rider was designed by Marvel Television creative director Joshua Shaw, based on Felipe Smith's design from the comics. His jacket was then custom made by costume designer Ann Foley and her team.[103][104] The character's skull design includes exhaust-type jets of flames coming from the temples to mimic the effects on his car.[105] Foley worked with the visual effects department to ensure that the costume would not interfere with their work.[103] Aida's costume was also custom made, and inspired by the works of Alexander McQueen.[103] The costume evolves through the season, becoming a darker shade of gray when the more ruthless "Aida 2.0" is introduced.[106] Foley left the show after the thirteenth episode of the season, to work on a television adaptation of Altered Carbon,[107] and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to "blend in" with Foley's established look, and also noted that the majority of her work was designing for the Framework reality which allowed her to not exactly match with previous designs. Riley took Foley's costumes for Aida as the base shape of the Madame Hydra costume, but looked to make it feel "stronger" and more military-esque than those costumes by having the shoulders of the costume evoke epaulettes. The costume uses the color green, which is closely tied with the character in the comics.[102]
