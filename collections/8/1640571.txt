As the C preprocessor can be invoked separately from the compiler with which it is supplied, it can be used separately, on different languages. Notable examples include its use in the now-deprecated imake system and for preprocessing Fortran. However, such use as a general purpose preprocessor is limited: the input language must be sufficiently C-like.[5] For preprocessing Fortran, a more flexible variant of the C preprocessor is preferred, GPP.[8] The GNU Fortran compiler automatically calls gpp before compiling Fortran code if certain file extensions are used.[9] Intel offers a Fortran preprocessor, fpp, for use with the ifort compiler, which has similar capabilities.[10]
