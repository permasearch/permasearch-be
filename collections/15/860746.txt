In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some comparative mythologists interpreted Samson as a euhemerized solar deity,[49][50][51][30] arguing that Samson's name is derived from the Hebrew word  šemeš, meaning "sun",[30][1] and that his long hair might represent the sun's rays.[30] These solar theorists also pointed out that the legend of Samson is set within the general vicinity of Beth Shemesh, a village whose name means "Temple of the Sun".[30] They argued that the name Delilah may have been a wordplay with the Hebrew word for night, layla, which "consumes" the day.[52] Although this hypothesis is still sometimes promoted in scholarly circles,[30] it has generally fallen out of favor due to the superficiality of supporting evidence.[30]
