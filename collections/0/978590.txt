The Mexico City Metro offers in and out-street transfers to three major rapid transit systems: the Mexico City Metrob√∫s bus rapid transit system, the Mexico City light rail system and the Ferrocarril Suburbano (FSZMVM) commuter rail. None of these is part of the Sistema de Transporte Colectivo network and an extra fare must be paid for access.
