Most of the Japanese (50% to 80% considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō[8]) pray and worship ancestors and gods (神 kami, shin or, archaically, jin) at Shinto shrines or private altars, while not identifying as "Shinto" or "Shintoist" in surveys.[9] This is because these terms have little meaning for the majority of the Japanese,[9] or they define membership in Shinto organisations or sects.[10][11] The term "religion" (宗教 shūkyō) itself in Japanese culture defines only organised religions (that is, religions with specific doctrines and required membership).[12] People who identify as "non-religious" (無宗教 mushūkyō) in surveys actually mean that they do not belong to any religious organisation, even though they may take part in Shinto rituals and worship.[12]
