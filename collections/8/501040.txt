Annalise has another hearing in which Bonnie tries, unsuccessfully, to argue that Annalise's trial should be severed from Frank's. Annalise is embarrassed to find that her parents have come to the trial after finding out she was in jail. Meanwhile, the Keating 4 are unable to attend the hearing because they need to attend Wes' memorial. Michaela picks up a now discharged Laurel from the hospital and takes her to the memorial, where Laurel breaks down and begins yelling at the attendees for their insincere grief. After the memorial, the rest of the gang can't find Laurel, who goes to the morgue and demands to see Wes' body, enlisting Nate's help to secure a viewing only to find out that his body has been lost by the morgue. Back in the prison, Annalise confronts her parents and discovers that her mother is suffering from dementia. She thinks that Annalise is taking the blame for her regarding the house fire set by herself that killed Annalise's abusive uncle, leading to a private confrontation between Annalise and her father about his neglect during that situation. Resolved to get out and help her mother, Annalise provokes a fight with her inmate to provide fodder for an abuse claim. Nate finds out that his signature is on the papers instructing Wes' body be moved.
