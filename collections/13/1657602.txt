Touring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[22] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[22] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, Kaibab, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[31] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[22] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge (photo) in the "Rustic Style" and the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[22]
