Sandoval finished the 2009 season with 25 home runs and 90 RBI in 153 games. He had the second-highest batting average among NL hitters, at .330 (behind Hanley Ram√≠rez's .342), and finished seventh in NL MVP voting.[23] Due to his service time in 2008, he was ineligible for the NL Rookie of the Year Award, which went to Chris Coghlan.[24]
