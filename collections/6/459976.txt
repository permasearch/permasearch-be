Fifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of Revolver described as a devoted "cult" following,[67] and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of Lateralus tourmates Fant√¥mas and Meshuggah,[68] controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs.[69] Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was 10,000 Days. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that 10,000 Days was merely a "decoy" album to fool audiences.[69] The rumor was proven false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release.[70]
