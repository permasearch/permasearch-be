Yanevski was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and lived in England for five years,[1] as well as Israel.[2] While attending Mill Hill School in the United Kingdom with fellow Harry Potter actor, Harry Melling, Ianevski had no particular acting aspirations and was not a drama student. He had only auditioned for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire after being spotted by Fiona Weir, a casting director who prompted him to attend an acting workshop, which resulted in his casting as Viktor Krum, a Bulgarian character in the Harry Potter series. He was selected from 650 others, most of whom had auditioned in Sofia, Bulgaria. He also starred in Hostel: Part II, the sequel to Eli Roth's film Hostel.
