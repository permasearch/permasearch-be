The song's first stanza was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950.[4] A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately fifty-two seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20Â seconds to play) is also staged occasionally.[5] It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now, Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.[6] This is the first of five stanzas of Tagore's Bengali song Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata.[7]
