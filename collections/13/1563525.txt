The publicity of Scott's slow rise to fame has grown, and the school's band appears in the stands to play his theme song, thanks to Bella contacting Rogan. During the fight, Marty reminds the losing Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose as teachers. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent, Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent cancelled and that he is stuck with a man that "does not deserve" to be fighting at the UFC. After finding inspiration from the students, Scott manages to win the fight, earning $50,000 and Dietrich's respect. Scott and Bella kiss through the chain link fence of the ring.
