The first flowering plants appeared around 130 Ma.[228] The 250,000 to 400,000 species of flowering plants outnumber all other ground plants combined, and are the dominant vegetation in most terrestrial ecosystems. There is fossil evidence that flowering plants diversified rapidly in the Early Cretaceous, from 130 to 90 Ma,[226][227] and that their rise was associated with that of pollinating insects.[227] Among modern flowering plants Magnolia are thought to be close to the common ancestor of the group.[226] However, paleontologists have not succeeded in identifying the earliest stages in the evolution of flowering plants.[226][227]
