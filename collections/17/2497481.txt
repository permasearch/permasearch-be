Emily is first heard performing surgery on Washington, saving him from a hallucination that was induced by Locus during The Federal Army of Chorus. Afterwards, she helps treat General Donald Doyle after he faints and later defends the Blood Gulch Crew from Locus when he makes them feel uncomfortable. She then formally introduces herself to the group before stating they'll be shipped off the next day. Weeks later, F.A.C. Outpost 37 is attacked by Locus and his team of mercenaries, forcing Grey to hide in her office.
