Two days after Super Bowl XLII, defensive back Willie Andrews was arrested in Lowell, Massachusetts on February 5 for possession of a half pound of marijuana and driving an unregistered car.[1] On May 9, Andrews' case was continued without finding for one year, during which time Andrews was ordered to pay a fine, speak to student athletes about the dangers of narcotics, and complete an NFL substance abuse program.[2] On June 30, Andrews was arrested again and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm in Mansfield, Massachusetts, after his fiancée accused him of pointing a gun at her head.[3] Andrews' fiancée called police, who searched Andrews' vehicle but did not find a gun; she later took her child to a hotel for the night, where Andrews then met her again before being arrested.[4] The weapon, a Glock pistol, was later recovered in a dumpster near Andrews' apartment.[3] Andrews was released on July 1.[5]
