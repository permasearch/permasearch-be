However, "the Islamic evaluation" of modern banking centers around the definition of interest on loans[127] as riba. Twelve verses in the Qur'an deal with riba, the word appearing eight times in total, three times in verses 2:275, and once in 2:276, 2:278,[128] 3:130,[128] 4:161[128] and 30:39.[129] Riba is mentioned numerous times in ahadith, including Muhammad's Farewell Sermon.
