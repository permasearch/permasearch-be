Hot Rod identified the Decepticons on board through the damaged hull and immediately attacked the targets within using low powered, rapid fire bursts. When the Decepticons returned fire, Hot Rod changed tactics and began firing more concentrated blasts at the shuttle itself. Eventually, he managed to disable the shuttle. With their cover blown, Megatron ordered his forces to attack and the Decepticons began pouring out, beginning their planned assault on Autobot City. Before focusing his attention on the assault on the city, an incensed Megatron destroyed the observation platform on which Hot Rod and Daniel were standing. True to his protective Autobot instincts, the first concern of Hot Rod was for the safety of Daniel. Quickly shielding the young boy, the two survived the platform collapse but were soon cornered by Blitzwing and Shrapnel. Timely intervention by the old and experienced Autobot Kup diverted the cannon fire from Blitzwing and allowed the three of them to escape.
