Throughout the establishment of the Starcraft II pro-scene, the GSL and WCS formats became the main avenues for top tier individual competition, with WCS "points" replacing Elo scores for assigning yearly rankings. Proleague was limited to a team-based format, with the most recent version being the SK Telecom Proleague, consisting of the 8 Kespa teams of South Korea competing. As of 2015, the World Championship Series (WCS) was the main format for the StarcraftÂ II 1v1 pro-scene.[5] The top-16 ranked players qualify for the ultimate end of year tournament at Blizzcon, with the winner being crowned world champion.
