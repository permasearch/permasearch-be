This first-generation model (1993–2002) sold in low numbers even domestically in South Korea, and post-Hyundai takeover models (1997–2002) were recalled twice for rear wheels dismounting while driving. The first-generation Sportage was discontinued in South Korea in 2002, and in North America after the 2002 model year. By 2003, most international markets had discontinued the Sportage range, although it did remain on sale in some developing countries until its second-generation replacement arrived in 2005.
