The first version of Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software was developed by Eugene Kaspersky in 1989 in response to the Cascade Virus.[10][11] Early versions had just 40 virus definitions and were mostly distributed to friends and family members.[12] Eugene continued developing the software at KAMI,[12][13] resulting in the Antiviral Toolkit Pro product released in 1992.[13][14][15] It was popularized in 1994 after a competitive analysis by Hamburg University gave Eugene's software first place.[13][14][15][16]
