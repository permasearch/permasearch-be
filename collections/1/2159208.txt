Amy grew up feeling unloved and unable to meet her parents' high expectations. She was also molested by a neighbor when she was eight, but never told anyone in her family. She began to self-mutilate and restrict her diet, and by 17, she was diagnosed with anorexia and bipolar disorder. Now, Amy eats only 500 calories a day, drinks up to two bottles of vodka a night, and regularly self-harms by burning herself with cigarettes and cutting. She has become a victim of date rape, has stolen money from her parents, and has attempted suicide multiple times. She currently has a roommate who is also alcoholic, and the two feed into each other's addictions. Family members are worried about Amy's young daughter and are ready to give up on Amy, but they still don't know about her childhood sexual abuse. Only Amy's friend, Jessica, knows the truth.
