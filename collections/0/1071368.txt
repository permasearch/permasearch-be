Following this, the band performed two shows in Australia and appeared at Download Festival.[38] In late June, the band filmed a music video for "I Caught Fire" with director Kevin Kerslake[39] in Los Angeles.[40] The video was subsequently released on August 15.[41] McCracken said that in contrast to the fairy-tale-esque video for "All That I've Got", the video for "I Caught Fire" had "a more straightforward approach" with the group "just kind of rock[ing] it out".[14] MTV wrote that the video "intersperses footage of the Used performing in a 'shadowy, mysterious place' with artfully shot scenes of couples making out".[40] In August and September, the band went on a headlining US tour with support from Thirty Seconds to Mars and Street Drum Corps. Glassjaw was also due to support but dropped off shortly before the tour began when their frontman fell ill. They were replaced by H2O.[42] In October and November, the band headlined the International Taste of Chaos tour which visited Mexico, Australia, Japan, the UK and Germany.[39]
