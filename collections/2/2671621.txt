The Rygalski character was inspired by, and named after, the real-life husband of Helen Pai â€” the show's co-producer, the inspiration for the character of Lane, and whose name is an anagram for the band name, Hep Alien. The real Dave Rygalski shares his namesake's musical hobby and was the inspiration for many of the character's acts of devotion, such as participating in religious activities to please Lane's mother.[17]
