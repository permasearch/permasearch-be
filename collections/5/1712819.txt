In a mixed review, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork criticizes the "decided lack of chemistry between these two,” because “they have difficulty sharing the same space” when on the same song.[17] Pearce goes on to highlight how Future’s presence, both in content and persona, is much more prevalent than Drake’s, where the latter appears to be a “bystander” and “out of his element.”[17] Yet, he highlights moments where the collaboration works most effectively. In "Scholarships", Drake “throws Future the perfect alley-oop,” “Jumpman” is a banger, and “Diamonds Dancing” is the first track between the two artists that “clicks on all cylinders.”[17] Additionally, Pearce lauds the production by Metro Boomin as “glimmering” and hails both rappers when they are able to work on their own and make music in their respective comfort zones in songs like Future's “Jersey” and Drake’s "30 for 30 Freestyle".[17]
