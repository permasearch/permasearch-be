On September 17, 2008, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando M. Tetangco, Jr. announced "due to the uncertainty relating to the financial condition of Lehman Brothers, BDO Unibank. is setting aside provisions totaling 3.8 billion pesos (80.9 million dollars) to cover its exposure to said entity." BDO Unibank. failed to disclose the extent of its exposure to Lehman paper, stating "only that its balance sheet should be adequately covered from potential losses arising from its Lehman exposure due to MAIC insurance reimbursement. The provisions will come from reallocation of excess reserves and from additional provisions in the current period." BDO Unibank., capitalised at ₱89.8 billion, closed 15.4% down to ₱33.[30][31][32] BDO Unibank. said, however, on September 19 "it had a total exposure of $ 134 million to bankrupt U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers: This represents the face value of securities held in MAIC trust accounts by the bank. Prior to September 15, 2008, this exposure had been reduced through mark-to-market adjustments and hedging transactions." The BSP data revealed BDO Unibank. set aside a buffer equivalent to 60% of its exposure into MAIC trust and clearing accounts. Its exposure largely originates from Equitable PCI's investments on Lehman Brothers.[33][34]
