The ATP Rankings are the objective merit-based method used by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.[1] The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. The rankings period is "the immediate past 52 weeks, except for: ATP World Tour Finals, singles and doubles, which is dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year; Futures Series tournaments that are only entered into the system on the second Monday following the tournament's week. Once entered, all tournaments, except the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, remain in the system for 52 consecutive weeks."[1]
