In humans, unlike other animals, the hip bones are substantially different in the two sexes. The hips of human females widen during puberty.[33] The femora are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.
