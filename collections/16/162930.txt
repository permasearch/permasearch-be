Cheryl is a student at Riverdale High School, head cheerleader of the River Vixens and the self-proclaimed Queen Bee at Riverdale High School. Cheryl's relationship with her family seemed to be quite strained ever since Jason's death. Her mother blamed her for assisting Jason in his attempt to run away from Riverdale, which essentially is what led to his demise. Cheryl's father thinks of her as a train wreck in comparison to Jason, who was considered the "Golden Boy". Cheryl eventually develops romantic feelings for Southside Serpent Toni Topaz, whom she grows close to after they see a movie together.
