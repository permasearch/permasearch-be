Ahmadiyya is a small persecuted Islamic sect in Saudi Arabia. There are "no accurate figures" for the number of Ahmadi in Saudi Arabia.[81] Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country[82] and are barred from performing the pilgrimage to Mecca. This has led to criticisms from multiple[citation needed] human rights organizations.[83] They are primarily foreign workers from India and Pakistan and some from other countries.[citation needed] An increasing number of Saudi citizens identify as Ahmadis.[citation needed] Since the Ahmadiyya faith is banned in the country,[citation needed] there are no Ahmadi mosques.[citation needed] Ahmadis generally gather together in private properties for their daily prayers,[citation needed] thereby limiting exposure to the local authorities.
