CREAR Futuros is a strong example of an awareness program that supports the Latino communities in New York City. This is because of their strong presence in City University of New York (CUNY) public schools; having been established in Lehman College and Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). This program is implemented in these schools with the purpose of providing mentorship for students and social networking amongst students and professors.[49]
