Kelly-Marie Maguire[12] (nÃ©e Ball; born 1983) is Kev Ball's (Dean Lennox Kelly) sister. A recovered heroin addict, she became a prostitute and inspired Lillian Tyler (Alice Barry) to open up a brothel, and struck up a relationship with Shane Maguire (Nicky Evans), which ended under intimidation from his father Paddy (Sean Gilder). She returned a couple of episodes later, telling Shane she "decided not to take his father's offer". This resulted in Shane confronting Paddy, who beat him up in The Jockey. At the end of series 5 Kelly announces she is pregnant with Shane's child, and is welcomed into the family with open arms by Paddy and Mimi (Tina Malone). In series 6 it is revealed by Kelly that she had had a phantom pregnancy, and was comforted by Mimi and Shane. Kelly appeared in 85 episodes overall.
