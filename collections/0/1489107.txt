A French Knight returning from the Crusades in the Holy Lands probably adopted the surname from “Saint Jacques” (or “James the Greater”).[3]  Jacques was one of Jesus’ Twelve Apostles, and is believed to be the first martyred apostle. Being endowed with this surname was an honor at the time and it is likely that the Church allowed it because of acts during the Crusades. Indeed, at this time, the use of biblical, Christian, or Hebrew names and surnames became very popular, and entered the European lexicon.[4]
