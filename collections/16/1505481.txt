In late October 2015, a Reddit user by the name of "Lumpawarroo" published a theory speculating that Binks was originally written as a major antagonist of the series, as Darth Jar Jar, and a prominent collaborator with Palpatine, before being redacted from the villain's role due to the character's initial (and ongoing) negative reception.[28] The post quickly became viral and received significant media coverage internationally by independent bloggers and major news outlets like The Guardian, The Washington Post, and The New York Times that included analysis of his actions in The Phantom Menace.[29][30][31][32] Ahmed Best, who portrayed Jar Jar Binks in motion capture and voice, tweeted his thoughts on how it "feels good" when the truth comes out shortly after the theory gained widespread popularity.[33]
