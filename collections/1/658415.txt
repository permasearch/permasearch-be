In 1525, publication of the work by Peter Quentell in Cologne was interrupted by the impact of anti-Lutheranism. A full edition of the New Testament was produced in 1526 by printer Peter Sch√∂ffer in Worms, a free imperial city then in the process of adopting Lutheranism.[23] More copies were soon printed in Antwerp. The book was smuggled into England and Scotland; it was condemned in October 1526 by Bishop Tunstall, who issued warnings to booksellers and had copies burned in public.[24] Marius notes that the "spectacle of the scriptures being put to the torch... provoked controversy even amongst the faithful."[24] Cardinal Wolsey condemned Tyndale as a heretic, first stated in open court in January 1529.[25]
