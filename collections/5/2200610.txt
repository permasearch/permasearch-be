Everyone at Kucha was relaxing around camp when Michael let out a giant yell. All of a sudden, Mike ran to the water and dove in. When his tribe asked what happened, he said he got a breath full of smoke and passed out, falling face first into the fire; his hands were completely burnt with skin hanging off. With the pain intensifying and his tribe helplessly watching from shore, they tried to calm him until the medical team could get to him. When the medics hurried in after about half an hour, they wrapped his hands in cold compresses, brought in the helicopter, and Mike said his goodbyes to his tribe, all of whom were visibly shaken.
