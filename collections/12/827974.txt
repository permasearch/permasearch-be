This act introduced the 11+ examination to determine if a child should be eligible for a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System,[3] but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England[14] and Northern Ireland[15] still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools;[16] data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.[17]
