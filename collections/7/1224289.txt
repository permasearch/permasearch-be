The German attack was a costly failure and the Germans switched to an open formation and attacked again. This attack was more successful, as the looser formation made it more difficult for the British to inflict casualties rapidly. The outnumbered defenders were soon hard-pressed to defend the canal crossings, and the Royal Fusiliers at the Nimy and Ghlin bridges only held on with piecemeal reinforcement and the exceptional bravery of two of the battalion machine-gunners.[28] At the Nimy bridge, Dease took control of his machine gun after the rest of the section had been killed or wounded and fired the weapon despite being shot several times. After a fifth wound he was evacuated to the battalion aid station, where he died.[29] Private Sidney Godley took over and covered the Fusilier retreat at the end of the battle, but when it was his time to retreat he disabled the gun by throwing parts into the canal then surrendered.[30] Dease and Godley were awarded the Victoria Cross, the first awards of the First World War.[31]
