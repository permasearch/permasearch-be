Trenton is located near the exact geographic center of the state, which is 5 miles (8.0Â km) located southeast of Trenton.[39][40] The city is sometimes included as part of North Jersey and as the southernmost city of the Tri-State Region, while others consider it a part of South Jersey and thus, the northernmost city of the Delaware Valley.[41]
