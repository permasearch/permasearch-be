Due to the world financial crisis, South Korea and Australia exited the trillion dollar club as their nominal GDPs shrank below $1 trillion in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Australia rejoined the list in 2010 while South Korea did so in 2011 as these countries' nominal GDPs once again were above $1 trillion. Accordingly, with the IMF, Mexico's estimated nominal GDP in 2009 also disminished below the trillion dollar mark, although other sources such as the CIA reported it above the mark.
