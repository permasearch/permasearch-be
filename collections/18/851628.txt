Skyscrapers in the sets were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create the effect of sunlight glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand on one side of the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers.[33] To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side.[33] While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups,[34] which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel.[29] Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place.[34] Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.[9]
