After having killed extortionist Mayil Vaaganam in the first film, Durai Singam (Suriya) has gone undercover after meeting the Home Minister, Ramanathan (Vijayakumar) and is working as an NCC officer in a school in Thoothukudi. The only people who know about this operation are the Chief Minister (K. Viswanath) and Ramanthan. Sathya (Hansika Motwani) is a student who falls for Durai Singam though he is waiting to marry Kavya (Anushka Shetty), his love interest. Durai Singam's father, Soundara Pandi is angry about him leaving the police force and refuses to speak with him. He also forbids the marriage between Durai Singam and Kavya, as he fears Kavya's father Mahalingam (Nasser) might take Durai Singam away to manage his business empire and that Durai Singam will lose respect within his relatives.
