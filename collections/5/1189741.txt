Two-way pallets are designed to be lifted by the deckboards. The standard 48x40 North American pallet, or GMA pallet, has stringers of 48 inches and deckboards of 40 inches, and was standardized by the Grocery Manufacturers Association.[2] A standard wooden pallet (48 in × 40 in × 6 in or 122 cm × 102 cm × 15 cm) with a static load bearing capacity of 3 short tons (2.7 long tons; 2.7 t) and a 1-short-ton (0.89-long-ton; 0.91 t) dynamic capacity, will weigh approximately 33 to 48 lb (15 to 22 kg) Lightweight plastic pallets can weigh as little as 3 to 15 pounds (1.4 to 6.8 kg), while heavier models may weight up to 30 pounds (14 kg).[3] Standard GMA pallets can hold up to 4,600 pounds (2,100 kg). GMA pallets typically weighs 37 pounds (17 kg), and are 6 1⁄2 inches (170 mm) tall. Their deck boards measure 3 1⁄4 inches (83 mm) wide and are 5⁄16 inch (7.9 mm) thick each.[4] Other dimensions of pallets have different weight capacities.[5][6]
