It came to R.B. Seth Moolchand Soniâ€™s mind that 5 Kalyanakas of Lord Rishabhdev could be displayed in models. Accordingly, the work started in Jaipur and it took 25 years to complete these replicas of Ayodhya and Mount Sumeru. The whole structure, covered with gold leaf, is made according to the descriptions contained in Adi Purana written by His Holiness Shri Jina Sen Acharya.
