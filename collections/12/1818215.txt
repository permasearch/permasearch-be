Halifax was concerned at the German 4:1 superiority in the air and believed that Germany was dangerously close to destroying British aircraft production in Birmingham and Coventry. Churchill thought the ratio was more like 5:3, with the ratio of kills 3:1 in Britain's favour.[14] Halifax did not want to give up British independence. He had mentioned that by fighting on, Churchill was risking destruction of Britain's aircraft factories; he was prepared to take that risk only if Britain's independence was actually at risk, and he was not willing to accept "outrageous" terms. Roberts stresses that Churchill neither entirely ruled out a compromise peace nor wanted to be the one to solicit it. When pressed by Halifax's threat of resignation, he had been open to conceding the return of German colonies or overlordship of Central Europe.[13]
