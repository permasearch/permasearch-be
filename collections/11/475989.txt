The first road connecting most of the eastside communities, Secondary State Highway 2A (SSH 2A),[10] was already in existence since at least 1927. SSH 2A connected US 10 and US 410 in Renton to the north, through Kirkland and Bothell, connecting back to US 99 in Everett.[11] In 1964, the system of Primary and Secondary state highways was removed in favor of signed routes, and PSH 2A was renumbered SR 405. The first segment of the interstate to be completed was between Tukwila and Renton, opening to traffic on August 31, 1965.[12] By 1971, SR 405 was renumbered to Interstate 405 after it was completely improved to Interstate Highway standards.[citation needed]
