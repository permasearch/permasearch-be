In the 1890s, some Boers trekked into Mashonaland, where they were concentrated at the town of Enkeldoorn, now Chivhu.[56] After the second Boer War, more Boers left South Africa. Starting in 1902 to 1908 a large group of around 650 Afrikaners[57] emigrated to the Patagonia region of Argentina (most notably to the towns of Comodoro Rivadavia and Sarmiento),[58][59] choosing to settle there due to its similarity to the Karoo region of South Africa.[57]
