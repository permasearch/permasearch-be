Ionic interactions involve the attraction of ions or molecules with full permanent charges of opposite signs. For example, sodium fluoride involves the attraction of the positive charge on sodium (Na+) with the negative charge on fluoride (Fâˆ’). These bonds are harder to break than covalent bonds because there is a strong electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged ions. However, this particular interaction is easily broken upon addition to water, or other highly polar solvents.
