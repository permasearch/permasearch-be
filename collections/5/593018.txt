Despite an air of defeatism among the leadership,[10] the professional French troops and New French militia defenders focused preparations for the British attacks on the Beauport Shore. Montcalm and his staff, Major-General François de Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis, Colonel Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue,[11] distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified redoubts and batteries from the Saint-Charles River to the Montmorency Falls, along the shallows of the river in areas that had previously been targeted by British attempts to land.[12] Prior to the arrival of the British, a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with much needed supplies.[10] Those supplies, along with 500 reinforcements, were likely behind the lengthened siege.[13]
