The products of incomplete combustion can be calculated with the aid of a material balance, together with the assumption that the combustion products reach equilibrium.[11][12] For example, in the combustion of one mole of propane (C 3H 8) with four moles of O 2, seven moles of combustion gas are formed, and z is 80% of the stoichiometric value. The three elemental balance equations are:
