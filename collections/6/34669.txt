All of Japan's ports were briefly shut down after the earthquake, though the ones in Tokyo and southwards soon re-opened. Fifteen ports were located in the disaster zone. The north eastern ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were destroyed, while the Port of Chiba (which serves the hydrocarbon industry) and Japan's ninth-largest container port at Kashima were also affected, though less severely. The ports at Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma, Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako were also damaged and closed to ships.[253] All 15 ports reopened to limited ship traffic by 29 March 2011.[254] A total of 319 fishing ports, about 10% of Japan's fishing ports, were damaged in the disaster.[255] Most were restored to operating condition by 18 April 2012.[256]
