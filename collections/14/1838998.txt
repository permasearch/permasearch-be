On the day that the Singer sings the Song at the Gathering, Matt is nowhere to be found. At the Ceremony of the Gathering, she notices that the current Singer has the staff that Thomas has worked so hard on, and is also wearing the robe that she repaired and enhanced. She realizes that his feet are chained, injured, scarred, and bleeding, meaning that he is essentially a prisoner, only kept for this one event because of his talent. The implication is that she and the others with Gifts, that the Counsel has saved for these jobs, are also prisoners. Their gifts are in control of the Council, by tenants who without any creativity of their own seek to control these three, in order to provide a future which they envision.
