On July 1, 2014 the first accredited NZ Living Wage Employers were announced. The twenty businesses for 2014-15 included food manufacturing, social service agencies, community organisations, unions, and a restaurant. This number has now increased to 90 businesses, including the first corporate, Vector. Wellington City Council has committed to becoming an accredited Living Wage Employer and five other local government bodies, including Auckland Council, have taken their first steps toward implementing the Living Wage. In the election of September 2017 the three parties that form the Government have also committed to a Living Wage for employees and contracted workers to the core public service.
