The Castleford Tigers currently hold the record for the longest time to win a premiership in either The Super League or The NRL.  Founded in 1926, Castleford have only played in three grand finals (1938,1969 & 2017) and for the first time in their 91-year history they finished first in The 2017 Super League season to claim their first ever league leaders shield.  Castleford's drought of 91 years to wait for a first title eclipses The Cronulla Sutherland Sharks record in The NRL of 49 years who had the longest drought of any professional rugby league team in Australia to wait for a first title.[32][33][34]
