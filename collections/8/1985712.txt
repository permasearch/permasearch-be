After a dawn engagement with German forces at in Le Cornet Malo, 'C' Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen back to their headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. During the fighting, units had become separated, with the Royal Norfolk HQ Company eventually creating a defensive position in a local farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, the boundary between the Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The company commanders were at that point informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. German forces attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery-fire, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders into a cowshed. The Royal Norfolk continued their stand into the evening, by which point many had been wounded by shellfire. The Norfolks' last contact with 4th Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette occurred at 11:30 but despite no support the defenders held out against the Germans until 5:15 p.m. when the Norfolks ran out of ammunition.[46][47]
