Dr. Deborah Asnis was credited by health experts with the early identification of West Nile virus in the United States.[6] Her actions likely prevented a more widespread outbreak.[6][7] In their 2003 book, "The New Killer Diseases: How the Alarming Evolution of Germs Threatens Us All," authors Elinor Levy and Mark Fischetti praised Dr. Asnis' response to the symptoms, writing that, "Asnis did something other doctors might not have bothered to do."[6] They elaborated that, "One of the worst problems with our disease-detection system is that many doctors never report cases of strange symptoms, either because they are unsure of the disease they are facing, they're ignorant of the reporting requirement, or they simply never get around to it. Deborah Asnis was highly conscientious."[6]
