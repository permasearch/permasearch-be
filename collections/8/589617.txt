Two days after McLeish's departure, the club re-appointed Billy Davies as manager, having been sacked as the team's manager twenty months previously.[102] His first match in charge was a draw,[103] followed by a run of 10 undefeated games. In March 2014, the club terminated Davies's employment, following a 5â€“0 defeat by Derby County.[104] Neil Warnock turned down the job as Forest manager on the day Davies was sacked. After initially rejecting the job in March 2014,[105] fans favourite Stuart Pearce was named the man to replace Billy Davies, taking over from caretaker manager Gary Brazil. He signed a two-year contract commencing on 1 July 2014. Pearce led Forest to an unbeaten start to the season but failed to keep up the form. He was sacked in February 2015 and replaced by another former Forest player, Dougie Freedman.
