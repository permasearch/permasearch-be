Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said that the show was "game, wacky, mildly overcompensatory" with an "impeccable" set design, although he thought that the "new material" she performed was "among her weakest". He praised Perry's onstage charisma and despite he thought that her live vocals were often â€œlow in the mix", he complimented the acoustic performances when the singer sat down and played on a guitar.[14] Jeffrey Lee Puckett from USA Today praised the visuals of the show, including the "non-stop blur of explosive lights, video, huge puppets, dancers, giant basketball goals, confetti and robot Venus flytraps". However, he felt the setlist was a "less successful" aspect of the show, adding "Perry's new songs from her Witness album don't have the sharpness or pop exuberance of her older material, instead just kind of sliding into a generic beat-per-minute muddle."[15] Jordan Zivitz from the Montreal Gazette said that "extra production time could have been used to adjust some visuals whose juxtapositions and statements were as confused as they were colourful", but complimented Perry's stage presence, adding that "the energy was certainly there, with the singer staying in constant motion on a multi-stage set for two hours."[16]
