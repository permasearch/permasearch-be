Besides interest in citizen science drift bottle experiments,[27] message-in-a-bottle lore has often been of a romantic or poetic nature.[57] Such messages have been romanticized in literature, from Edgar Allan Poe’s 1833 “MS. Found in a Bottle” through Nicholas Sparks' 1998 Message in a Bottle.[98] Clint Buffington surmised in an interview with The Guardian that sending a bottled message expresses a hope to find connection in a fear-filled world.[99] In Newsweek Ryan Bort recounted various historical messages as being cries for help, or "final, poetic words of resignation left behind for (an) indifferent sea," or from "lonely, lovelorn souls, searching for serendipity," or a search for "affirmation ... that comes from somewhere other than yourself."[57] Bort described sending a message in a bottle as a romantic act that has "such a delicious potential for magic" or as "surrendering a part of yourself to something larger," concluding that "every message in a bottle is a prayer."[57]
