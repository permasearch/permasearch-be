In 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the Mission: Impossible film series for a summer of 2004 release date.[5] Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film,[6] later citing creative differences over the direction of the series.[4] Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months.[7] Under his involvement, the film was to feature "Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who's based on Timothy McVeigh," as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles.[8] Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from Mission: Impossible 2; she declined, however.
