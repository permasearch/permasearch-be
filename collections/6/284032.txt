In the live-action version, the Enchantress is played by Hattie Morahan, who also serves as the narrator of the prologue. She came to a debutante ball disguised as a beggar woman (portrayed by Rita Davies) and offered a rose as payment for shelter from the storm. The Prince turned her away twice, prompting her to reveal her true self. She not only transformed the prince, his servants, and the castle, but erased the villagers' memory of the prince. Years later, she reappeared disguised as a hermit named Agathe. A deleted scene during the "Belle" song had Belle giving bread and jam to Agathe. She later tended to Maurice when Gaston left him for dead for the latter's refusal to hand Belle in marriage. Later, she came to the Beast's chamber while the Beast lay near death and overheard Belle profess her love for him despite it already being too late, as the last petal on the rose had fallen. She turned the rose into enchanted dust which revived the Beast and transformed both him and his servants into humans once again.
