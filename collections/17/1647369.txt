On the engines, the new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The multitronic continuously variable transmission continues as an alternative for front-wheel drive models, alongside a new six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission available in the four-wheel drive models. Audi's "trademark" Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. quattro is not available on the multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and tiptronic gear systems. Conversely the tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre V6 engine, but not for the North American market.
