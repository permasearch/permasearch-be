TBS became only the second U.S. cable channel to transmit its programming via satellite; HBO (which eventually became a sister channel to TBS through Time Warner's 1996 acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System) began to distribute its signal nationally through satellite transmission on September 30, 1975[4] but cable subscribers were required to pay extra to receive that service. Ted Turner's innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution.
