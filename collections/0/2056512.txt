His stormiest divorce was from Esperanza Baur, a former Mexican actress. She believed that Wayne and co-star Gail Russell were having an affair, a claim which both Wayne and Russell denied.

Esperanza was in a drunken rage by the time he arrived, and she attempted to shoot him as he walked through the front door.[5]
