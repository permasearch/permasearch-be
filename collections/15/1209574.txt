Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode a 6.2 out of 10, classifying it as "Okay." Schedeen enjoyed the jokes and gags from the episode, but felt the "many warring subplots failed to coalesce into a satisfying whole."[1] Kevin Johnson with The A.V. Club rated the episode as B+, and commented how he enjoyed the fact that the show "has managed to consistently find ways to reinvent itself, whether by leaning harder on its satirical edge, developing its cast in deeper, unique ways, improving the scale of the animation, or establishing longer story arcs."[2] Chris Longo with Den of Geek gave the episode 2.5 out of 5 stars, and noted that this season already appears to be "converging into some big conspiracy, which hasn't been the show's strength."[3]
