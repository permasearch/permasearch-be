Originally, Walter Chrysler had a two-story apartment on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the loftiest bathrooms in the city.[34] Chrysler also had a unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence.[189] However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing to stay at the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit.[91] Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic.[186] In 2005, a New York Times report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969.[190] The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.[186]
