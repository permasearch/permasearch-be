Shortly after moving into a neighborhood in the valley, Tod befriends Homer Simpson, a simple minded former hotel accountant from Iowa who moved to California for health reasons. Homer's "unruly hands" operate independently from his body, and their movements are often mechanical.[10] "They demanded special attention, had always demanded it."[11] When Homer attempts to escape California he is distracted not only by the crowd but his inability to leave the street despite Tod's help and insistent encouragement. Young neighbor Adore Loomis finds Homer and torments him until Homer lashes out against the boy. The novel's climactic riot ensues and the chaos over the latest Hollywood premiere turns violent outside Mr. Khan's Pleasure Dome. Tod vividly revises "The Burning of Los Angeles" in his mind, while being pushed around in the waves of the riot. The final scene plays out, uninterrupted. The conclusion of the novel can be read as a moment of enlightenment and mental clarity for the artist, or a complete "mental breakdown" and Tod's "incorporation into the mechanized, modern world of Los Angeles."[12]
