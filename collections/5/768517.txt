Following brief roles in three small-scale features of 2002—The Slaughter Rule, Pumpkin, and Serving Sara—Adams found her first high-profile part in Steven Spielberg's comedy-drama Catch Me If You Can after casting director Deborah Zane brought her to Spielberg's attention.[11][27] She was cast as Brenda Strong, a nurse with whom Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) falls in love. She described her experience on the film as a "huge confidence booster".[28] Despite the film's success and praise for her "warm presence" from Todd McCarthy, a critic for Variety, it failed to launch her career. She was unemployed for a year after its release, leading her to almost quit film acting.[17][29] Adams instead enrolled in acting classes, realizing that she had "a lot to learn and a lot of self-growth to work through".[2][17] Her career prospects seemingly improved a year later when she received a lucrative offer to star as a regular in the CBS television drama Dr. Vegas, but she was dropped after a few episodes.[2] On film, she only had a minor role as the fiancée of Fred Savage's character in the little-seen The Last Run (2004).[30]
