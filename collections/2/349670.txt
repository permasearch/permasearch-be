Construction of Naval Air Station Cubi Point began during the Korean War.  The town of Banicain was demolished to build the airfield, and its residents were relocated to Olongapo.  As Olongapo's population grew to 60,000, Filipinos requested control of the town.  On 7 December 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine control.  Grande Island was converted to a recreation center for naval personnel; and most of the historic Coastal Artillery guns of Fort Wint were moved to United States coastal defense parks in 1963 and 1968.[7]
