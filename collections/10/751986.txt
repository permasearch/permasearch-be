In Kingdom Hearts, after hearing Jack speak of a heart that can control the Heartless, Oogie sends the three out to steal the heart as his plan to take over Halloween Town.  After the three are defeated by Sora, Donald, and Goofy, they confess that Oogie made them do it. Later in the game they comment how quiet Halloween town has become without Oogie and consider making a ruckus just to liven things up. In Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the three found a Heartless and raised it before it became too big for them to control.
