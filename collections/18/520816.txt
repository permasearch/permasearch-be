The relative importance given to each of these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts.[60] The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach.[60] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology.[60] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation.[60] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: "In most of their theologizing, however, my impression is that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner."[60] In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.[60]
