The 1930s-style music video for the song was directed by David LaChapelle.[31] In the video, Stefani portrays a black widow whose look closely resembles that of actress Jean Harlow (whom Stefani portrayed in the Martin Scorsese film The Aviator),[32] who is put on trial and sentenced to death for the murders of three men she knew, who are portrayed by the other members of the band. She kills the first man (guitarist Tom Dumont) with rat poison mixed into his dinner, the second (bassist Tony Kanal) by running him over with her car, and the third (drummer Adrian Young) by throwing her hair dryer into the bathtub to electrocute him. These scenes are intercut with moments of Stefani in court and being dragged to the gas chamber wearing a prison uniform where she is executed. The video ends with the three murder victims together presumably in the afterlife, laughing at her televised execution.
