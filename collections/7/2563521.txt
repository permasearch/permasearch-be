The point group of this complex is D3. The complex can be resolved into enantiomers that are described as Δ and Λ. Usually the resolution entails use of tartrate salts.[4] The optical resolution is a standard component of inorganic synthesis courses.[5] Because of its nonplanarity, the MN2C2 rings can adopt either of two conformations, which are described by the symbols λ and δ. The registry between these ring conformations and the absolute configuration of the metal centers is described by the nomenclature lel (when the en backbone lies parallel with the C3 symmetry axis) or ob (when the en backbone is obverse to this same C3 axis). Thus, the following diastereomeric conformations can be identified: Δ-(lel)3, Δ-(lel)2(ob), Δ-(lel)(ob)2, and Δ-(ob)3. The mirror images of these species of course exist also.[6]
