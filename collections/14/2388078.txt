The Summertime Song (voiced by Sean Szeles) is a living tape with the band "Solid Bold" song Summertime Lovin', Lovin' in the Summer(Time) on it. After coming to life and brutally annoying the park gang, Mordecai,Rigby, Skips, and the rest come up with an even catchier song and destroy the tape for good. The Summertime Song returns in "Exit 9B" thanks to GBF Jr. reviving him.
