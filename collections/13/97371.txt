During the Middle Ages, Isidore of Seville (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (pestifera semina) in his On the Nature of Things (ca. AD 613).[14] Later in 1345, Tommaso del Garbo (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).[15]
