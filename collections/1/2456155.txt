Eureka College athletic teams, known as the Red Devils, participate at the NCAA Division III level.[13] There are teams for men's and women's soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming, golf and track, as well as football, volleyball, baseball and softball. Starting in fall 2006, teams will compete as part of the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Eureka was a member of the Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference until the spring of 2006. Eureka College was also a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1910 to 1942. On September 1, 2012 Eureka College quarterback Sam Durley set an NCAA record with 736 passing yards in Eureka's 62â€“55 victory over Knox College. That beat the old record of 731 yards set by a Menlo College quarterback in 2000.[14]
