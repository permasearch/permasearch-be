The 2017 Alabama Crimson Tide football team (variously "Alabama", "UA", "Bama" or "The Tide") represented the University of Alabama during the 2017 NCAA Division I FBS football season. This season marked the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, its 84th as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and its 26th within the SEC Western Division. They played their home games at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and were led by eleventh-year head coach Nick Saban. During the final College Football Playoff (CFP) Selection poll, Alabama was included at number 4, and played number 1 Clemson in a rubber match of the past two playoffs in the semi-final game played at the 2018 Sugar Bowl, which they won 24–6. Alabama was matched in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship game against number 3 and SEC champion and rival Georgia, who beat Oklahoma in the 2018 Rose Bowl, 54–48. Alabama won in overtime, 26–23, to secure the CFP National Championship. Alabama was also selected as champions by the Associated Press (AP)[1] for a record 11th time in program history and recognized by the National Football Foundation (NFF) as the McArthur Bowl recipient,[2] giving Alabama their 17th claimed national title.
