Mia Toretto is Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest. Mia knows of her brother's crimes, but disapproves and does not involve herself in them. Dominic's friend, Vince, is shown to be attracted to her. Mia is also shown to be a proficient driver as she also grew up with Dominic under their race car driver father. In Fast & Furious, Mia is under surveillance by the FBI. She is seen at Letty's funeral and is mostly seen afterwards either persuading Dominic not to get in danger, or talking to Brian about their past together. When Dominic gets injured, Brian calls her to help him. In Fast Five, she is happily living with Brian and reveals that she is pregnant with his baby. Throughout the film, she assists Dominic's crew in the heist by driving and staying back at base with surveillance. In Fast & Furious 6, she and Brian now have a son named Jack. After Elena helps rescue Jack, Mia is kidnapped by Shaw's henchmen Vegh and Klaus. She is rescued by Brian and returns to the US with Dom and the others. In Furious 7, Mia does not get involved in the team's mission for revenge on Deckard Shaw, who has murdered their close friend Han and blown up the family home, as she stays to look after Jack and is pregnant with her second child. Mia is extremely worried that Brian will be killed but also confesses to her brother she fears the quiet life may not be for Brian due to him telling her he 'misses the bullets'. She is last seen on the beach playing with her family as the rest of the team look on. In The Fate of the Furious Mia is mentioned by Letty as she reminds Roman that the team all agreed to keep Brian and her out of any conflict they are a part of. Mia Toretto is portrayed by Jordana Brewster.
