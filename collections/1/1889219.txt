The original R4 card was updated in early 2007 to the R4 version 2, or R4v2.[15] In late 2007 the R4v2 was revised, eliminating the spring mechanism for inserting and releasing the microSD card. Instead, it had a slot in the back into which a user could insert a microSD card. This eliminated the problem in the original R4 Revolution DS Card where the spring mechanism malfunctioned after prolonged use.[16] DS-Scene.net rated the original R4 at 95 percent in its review.[17]
