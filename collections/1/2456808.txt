Magnum XL-200 was announced on August 16, 1988, and construction began shortly thereafter.[9] Following its completion in 1989, Kinzel was one of the first people to ride the coaster, boarding the train after one test cycle.[10] It officially opened to the public on May 6, 1989 as the world's tallest, fastest and steepest complete-circuit roller coaster. It was measured for the Guinness Book of World Records on June 2.[11][12] Cedar Point set a record attendance in 1989, due in part to the introduction of the Magnum.[4]
