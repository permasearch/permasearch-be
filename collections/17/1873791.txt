Carefully using ideas from the theory of supply and demand, aggregate supply can help determine the extent to which increases in aggregate demand lead to increases in real output or instead to increases in prices (inflation). In the diagram, an increase in any of the components of     A D   {\displaystyle AD}   (at any given     P   {\displaystyle P}  ) shifts the     A D   {\displaystyle AD}   curve to the right. This increases both the level of real production (    Y   {\displaystyle Y}  ) and the average price level (    P   {\displaystyle P}  ).
