Lord Marksman and Vanadis entered development after author Tsukasa Kawaguchi accepted an offer by the MF Bunko J editorial department to write a fantasy novel for them.[2] Kawaguchi contributed the concept of a young male archer and a female fighter who uses a sword as the protagonists, which the editorial department approved of. At the editorial department's suggestion, Kawaguchi included seven additional fighting girls and called them "war maidens". Kawaguchi wanted to have another weapon from a novel he had previously worked on for Tigre. The Monster Hunter video game franchise gave Kawaguchi the inspiration to develop Tigre's archery skills.[2] Other influences for Tigre included historical archers such as Nasu no Yoichi and Robin Hood.[2] Kawaguchi came up with the catch phrases "Strongest Bishōjo Fantasy" as well as the "Bishōjo Battle Fantasy" during the early part of development.[3] When Kawaguchi was planning the second arc, he wanted to set the second arc in three years time. However, his editor requested that it should be set six months after the first arc.[4]
