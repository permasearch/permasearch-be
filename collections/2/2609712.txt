The most common problem due to hepatitis C but not involving the liver is mixed cryoglobulinemia (usually the type II form) — an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels.[30][31] Hepatitis C is also associated with the autoimmune disorder Sjögren's syndrome, a low platelet count, lichen planus, porphyria cutanea tarda, necrolytic acral erythema, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.[32][33] 20–30% of people infected have rheumatoid factor — a type of antibody.[34] Possible associations include Hyde's prurigo nodularis[35] and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.[20] Cardiomyopathy with associated abnormal heart rhythms has also been reported.[36] A variety of central nervous system disorders has been reported.[37] Chronic infection seems to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.[9][38]
