Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote of Rihanna's vocals: "Listen to the ragged squeak in her voice in the first verse, and how she maintains control as she alternates between contemplative trills and gospel shouts during the bridge".[31] According to Kornhaber, the song showcases "how distinctive her timbre and phrasing is", something that wasn't heard on her previous songs like the 2010 single "Only Girl (In the World)".[31] Travis Grier of Def Pen Radio thought that the song is a good choice for Rihanna to achieve legendary status, as, "she's tackled pretty much every genre under the sun and 'FourFiveSeconds' just expands her versatility even more".[17] Crotty of Elle wrote that the song is "awesome" and "sweet".[27] In June 2015, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard named "FourFiveSeconds" one of the "10 Best Songs of 2015 (So Far)" stating "It's the end of June, and we're still waiting for the new Rihanna and Kanye West albumsâ€¦ as well as some indication that either will be coming soon. To tide us over, however, the pair of music superstars linked up with a legend and recorded a durable, folked-up soul sing-along. Ye and Rih always zag when we expect them to zig, and we're forever grateful for it."[32]
