On September 22, 2013 it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score of Shall We Dance will eventually be released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent.[6] The entire Gershwin project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, and it is unclear when Shall We Dance will be released.[7] Other than the sequences Hoctor's Ballet and Walking The Dog, it will be the first time the score has been published.[8]
