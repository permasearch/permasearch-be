The school began by offering a two-year degree, which was extended to three years in 1954. In parallel with its change of location in Angers with the campus move to Belle-Beille, ESSCA's programs were extended in 1969 to four years. With its admission to the Conférence des Grandes Écoles in 1977, the school reached the level of older French business schools. It was further validated by the French State's approval of its master's degree in 1980. In 1993, the school opened its Paris and Budapest campuses. Since 1999 the school's masters programs have been completed in five years, aligning the MSc in Management with comparable business schools in France and Europe.[2]
