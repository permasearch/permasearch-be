The car's profile is dominated by the prominent wheel arches and the body's high waistline which contrast with the slim side windows, which is a modern interpretation of "coke bottle styling" popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Echoing a style first seen on the Maxima, Nissan's high performance electric coupé concept shown at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show, the glasshouse resembles a crash helmet visor. A coupé-like appearance is achieved by the rear door handles being located near the C-pillars, within the window frame. Locating the rear door handles within the window frame is a Nissan styling tradition, begun with the 1985 Nissan Pathfinder, copied from the first generation of the Lancia Y. The sport motif continues inside with the red- or grey-painted centre console bearing similarity to a motorcycle fuel tank.
