In the episode, SpongeBob accidentally receives Squidward's Fancy Living Digest magazine in the mail, inspiring him and Patrick to become entrepreneurs. At the suggestion of Patrick, the pair become door-to-door chocolate bar salesmen, which results in them purchasing large quantities of chocolate bars from the Barg 'n' Mart. The first customer is a fish who just screams "CHOCOLATE!" and chases the two away. Afterward, SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to sell chocolate to another fish, who cons them into buying chocolate-carrying bags twice in a row. They then try to sell to a woman who wants to buy a chocolate bar, but when SpongeBob is not able to find one because of all of the carrying bags, the customer loses her patience and slams the door. When SpongeBob finally finds a chocolate bar, him and Patrick get chased away again by the chocolate fanatic.
