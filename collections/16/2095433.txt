In July 2012, Hanson and his colleague Jon Jafari (known for his comedy webseries JonTron) created a joint YouTube channel, called Game Grumps. In late June 2013, Dan Avidan, of the band Ninja Sex Party, replaced Jafari when he retired Game Grumps to focus on his personal channel.[22] On Game Grumps, Hanson and Avidan play video games and talk, to an often comedic effect.[23] Hanson has also appeared on the channel's spin-off shows Steam Train and GrumpCade, along with other Game Grumps members in a similar format to the parent show; he and Avidan also front 10 Minute Power Hour, in which they engage in and frequently struggle with various activities.
