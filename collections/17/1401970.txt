After using radium in the surgicial treatment of tuberculosis, researchers including BÃ©la Augustin and A. de Szendeffy soon developed a treatment using radioactive metholated iodine, which was patented under the name dioradin (formed from "iodine and radium") in 1911. Application of this treatment was referred to as iodo-radium therapy, and involved injecting dioradin intramuscularly. It seemed promising to the developers, because in several cases, fever and hemoptysis had disappeared.[3] Inhalation of iodine alone had been an experimental treatment for tuberculosis in France between 1830 and 1870.[35]
