After France was conquered by Nazi Germany in June 1940, many Thais considered it a precious opportunity to regain territories lost to France during the reign of King Rama V. Publicity campaigns led by nationalists took place in Bangkok on 8 October 1940. The Thai government proposed that, if French Indochina lacked the capability to protect itself, then they should hand over the territories formerly owned by Thailand. This proposal was strongly rejected by the French, who then mobilized their troops to the Thai border at Aranyaprathet. The Thai prime minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram regarded this an act of war. Thailand, whose army and air force were outclassed by the French, won a majority of the battles. However, Japan became concerned that Thai advances would be an obstacle to the Japanese, since Japan had been allowed to occupy Northern French Indochina. Therefore, Japan stepped in to mediate the conflict. The ceasefire was signed on 9 May 1941, with some parts of French Indochina being ceded to Thailand by the French.
