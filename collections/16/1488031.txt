To do this, he compared the high-temperature and low temperature limits. At infinite temperature, Î² = 0, all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus are represented by black and white, they look like television snow. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little bit, but the screen stays random looking, and there is no net excess of black or white.
