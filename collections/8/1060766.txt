Despite Dr. Castillo stating in Jason X: Death Moon that he does not have a family, the novel Jason X: To The Third Power (in which Dr. Castillo's name is changed from Armando Castillo to Arthur J Castillo) reveals he has a wife and three daughters - Luna, Terra and Skye Fellows. Jason X: To The Third Power also states that after the events of Jason X: Death Moon almost all evidence of Dr. Castillo's existence was wiped out.[41]
