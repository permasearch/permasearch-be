In the United States, most aspects of operating a car dealership are regulated at the state level. Car titles are issued and transferred by the individual states through their respective Departments of Motor Vehicles. The purchase price of a vehicle usually includes various fees which the dealer forwards to the state DMV to transfer the vehicle's title to the buyer. In many states, the DMVs also license and regulate car dealerships. In many states, car dealerships are capable of submitting all necessary forms to the DMV on behalf of the customer and are authorized to issue temporary paperwork to the customer to prove that the transaction is in process, thereby allowing the customer to avoid a trip to the nearest DMV office.
