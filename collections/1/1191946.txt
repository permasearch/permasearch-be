The original British version of the album was released on Compact disc in 1984, but became out-of-print on CD for many years afterwards. In November 2010, it was made available as part of a limited edition vinyl box set titled The Rolling Stones 1964â€“1969, and by itself digitally at the same time. The original title was also re-instated as part of the Rolling Stones in Mono CD box set, released on September 30, 2016. The album was only released in mono in both the UK and US; no true stereo mix was ever made.
