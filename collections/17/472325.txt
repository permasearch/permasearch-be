Sex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. [3][4][5]. Somewhat bizarrely, sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004 who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15,2004 and January 1, 2011.
