The Trenton Public Schools serve students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide,[153] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[154][155] The superintendent runs the district and the school board is appointed by the mayor. The school district has undergone a 'construction' renaissance throughout the district.
