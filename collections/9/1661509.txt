In the late Pleistocene era, a huge landslide occurred at the mountain, with approximately 25 km³ of debris travelling some 120 km, reaching the Pacific Ocean. An area of some 2,200 km² was covered in landslide deposits. The currently active cone is situated within a large caldera that was probably formed by a combination of landslides and large eruptions. The lava is andesite containing 56-61% SiO2.[6] About 300,000 people live within 40 km (25 miles) of the volcano, which makes it the most dangerous volcano in Mexico.[3] In light of its history of large eruptions and situation in a densely populated area, it was designated a Decade Volcano, singling it out for study.
