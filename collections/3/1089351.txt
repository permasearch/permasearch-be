Nick returned in 1997 to study PE at Tech. Gail did not approve of his relationship with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) but Nick and Leanne eloped and, wanting to be independent, rented a room from Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and live together. While Nick was at college, his class was visited by Darren Whateley (Andy Robb), during a criminology lesson. When Darren described the details of the crime he had been imprisoned for, Nick realised that Darren had killed Brian. Wanting revenge, he wrote to Darren under Leanne's name, asking to meet. Darren agreed, and, when released on parole, he visited Leanne, who was frightened and furious with Nick for putting her in danger. When Nick told Darren who he was, Darren threatened him. Nick reported him to the police and he was arrested and returned to prison for violating his parole conditions. Short of money, in December 1998, Nick started modelling for his art teacher. Leanne suspected him of adultery and confronted him as he posed for the art teacher. On New Years Eve 1998, Leanne refused to attend his birthday party and Nick was shocked to learn that she was pregnant. In April 1999, the art teacher suggested Leanne have an abortion and Nick demanded she do so. Leanne reluctantly agreed and was upset to learn that he was telling people that she miscarried. Nick returned to Canada alone after Leanne told him that she no longer loved him.
