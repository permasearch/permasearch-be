Army's strategy was criticised by comparing it with the blockade approach taken by KPS Gill five years later in Operation Black Thunder—when Sikh militants had again taken over the temple complex—was highly successful, Operation Blue Star could have been averted by using similar blockade tactics. The Army responded by stating that "no comparison is possible between the two situations", as "there was no cult figure like Bhindranwale to idolise, and no professional military general like Shahbeg Singh to provide military leadership" and "the confidence of militants having been shattered by Operation Blue Star."[123] Furthermore, it is pointed out that the separatists in the temple were armed with machine guns, anti tank missiles and Chinese made armour piercing rocket launchers, and that they strongly resisted the Army's attempts to dislodge them from the shrine, appearing to have planned for a long standoff, having arranged for water to be supplied from wells within the temple compound and had stocked food provisions that could have lasted months.[123]:153–154
