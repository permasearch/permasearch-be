Penn was also an early investor in the Americas, where he co-owned much of what would later become the state of New Jersey along with fourteen other Quaker investors. Due to his investment in New Jersey, Penn developed an interest in developing another colony in the Americas, one where Quakers and other persecuted European religious minorities could coexist. Upon his fatherâ€™s death, Penn had inherited a sizable debt originally owed to his father by King Charles II in exchange for several loans to the crown and years of back pay. In exchange for the negation of the debt, Charles agreed to grant Penn a large amount of land, located south of the Province of New York and north of the Province of Maryland.[4] At 29 million acres, the land grant made Penn the largest non-monarchical land owner in the world.[5]
