About 300 costumes were designed for the three leads alone.[39] Real zari and goldwires were used to weave the costumes.[41] Since no pictures of Kashibai existed, the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma were used as a reference for designing her looks and costumes.[39] Modi had designed eighty nauvari or nine-yard saris with bright colours such as yellows, hot pink, emerald green and purple, inspired from the Raja Ravi Varma paintings, for Chopra.[42] The custom-made nine-yard saris were weaved by craftsmen from Maheshwar, Chander and Varanasi; they were made a little lighter than usual to avoid making Chopra Priyanka look large on screen.[43][44] For making the saris, fabrics such as Mul-Mul, silk, muslin, khadi and chanderis worn in that period were designed.[39][42] For one song sequence featuring Chopra, Modi had created six sets of the same sari.[43]
