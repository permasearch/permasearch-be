Complex's writers called the song "a great, extraordinarily catchy record. The hook, the beat, her lyrics: it all works. Cardi sounds so sure of herself, it's difficult not to believe and rap along with every word. Her shit feels like early Lil' Kim, the way the fellas react to her bars. That beat drops and people go nuts."[12] When commenting on the song, Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote "On 'Bodak Yellow,' Cardi uses [her] voice to fill up the synthy, minimal beat, using all the track's open space to project personality everywhere. It's a big, loud, brash, noisy song, and it's perfect."[13] USA Today wrote "The trackâ€™s name is a reference to the Florida rapper Kodak Black, borrowing the distinctive cadences he used on his minor hit 'No Flockin'. But 'Bodak Yellow' is no ripoff, and unlike so many other social media celebrities whose musical endeavors came and went, Cardi is a natural."[14]
