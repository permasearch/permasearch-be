In 1991, the constitution was changed to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, but the changes were not immediately implemented.[14] On July 31, 2006, Colombia approved voting by foreigners for mayors and city council elections. To vote, foreigners must have been residents of Colombia for 5 years and must register with the electoral authorities. Voting is not compulsory and voting aliens have the same voting-related privileges citizens would.[42]
