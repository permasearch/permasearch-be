Studying the effects of damage to the ACC provides insights into the type of functions it serves in the intact brain. Behavior that is associated with lesions in the ACC includes: inability to detect errors, severe difficulty with resolving stimulus conflict in a Stroop task, emotional instability, inattention, and akinetic mutism.[30][5][6] There is evidence that damage to ACC is present in patients with schizophrenia, where studies have shown patients have difficulty in dealing with conflicting spatial locations in a Stroop-like task and having abnormal ERNs.[6][16] Participants with ADHD were found to have reduced activation in the dorsal area of the ACC when performing the Stroop task.[31] Together, these findings corroborate results from imaging and electrical studies about the variety of functions attributed to the ACC.
