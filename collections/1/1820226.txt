The Persian Achaemenid Empire fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC,[14] which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area.[15] Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small Hellenistic kingdoms, all of which became part of the Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC.[16] The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early centuries AD the local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely replaced by ancient Greek language and culture.[17][18]
