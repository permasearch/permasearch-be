In his book Tarzan: The Biography, author Sean Egan argues that the name "Tarzan" is illogical, asserting that it is "a non-guttural word [that is] not the sort of sound that naturally emanates from the mouth of even a man-like simian." [6] He also says filmmakers down the decades have consistently failed to acknowledge the incongruity of Tarzanâ€™s name, with a few exceptions, such as the 1998 movie Tarzan and the Lost City and the 2017 Netflix series Tarzan and Jane, which came up with a logical get-around by making the name one bequeathed by Africans, and Greystoke, which dispensed with the problem by jettisoning the name entirely.
