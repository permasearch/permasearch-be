Russia continued to see an opportunity to weaken British power by causing British Columbia, including the Royal Navy base at Esquimalt, to be surrounded or annexed by American territory.[8] Following the Union victory in the civil war, the Tsar instructed the Russian minister to the United States, Eduard de Stoeckl, to re-enter into negotiations with William H. Seward in the beginning of March 1867. President Johnson was entangled in negotiations about Reconstruction and Seward had alienated a number of Republicans, so they believed that the purchase would help divert attention from the domestic issues.[9] The negotiations concluded after an all-night session with the signing of the treaty at 04:00 on March 30, 1867,[10] with the purchase price set at $7.2 million ($105Â million in 2016), or about 2 cents per acre ($4.74/km2).[1][11]
