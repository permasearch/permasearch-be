The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) was issued in Norman French by Edward I in 1297.[129] Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, and they had armed themselves against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war.[130] The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent,[126] although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.[131]
