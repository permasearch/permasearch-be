Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, two deleted scenes from "Greg Pikitis" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first minute-long clip, Leslie broadcasts an impression of a police officer on Dave's police radio, which gets him into trouble. She also discusses the frequent use of torture by Jack Bauer, the protagonist of the Fox series 24, while she contemplates torturing Greg Pikitis. In the second 75-second clip, Jerry nearly passes out from dehydration in his oversized Halloween dragon costume, and Leslie arrives late to the party dressed as a nurse.[4]
