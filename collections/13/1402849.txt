Whilst living, Christian is a quick tempered alcoholic.  He is hard on his son, but is keen to be a better father to Jack than his father (Ray Shephard) was to him.[1]  A common theme throughout Lost is father issues. Jack's difficulties getting on with his father are the first instance of this, with many other characters such as Locke,[16] Hurley[17] and Kate[18] also having difficult relationships with their dads. Christian further exemplifies this theme with his poor relationship with his daughter, Claire, where he was barely present in her upbringing.[2] The connection between characters before the plane crash is another frequently occurring theme. Christian is present in flashbacks of Jack,[1] Sawyer,[8] Ana Lucia[7] and Claire.[2] Ben Rawson-Jones from DigitalSpy describes Christian as "flawed character with both wisdom and regret".[19]
