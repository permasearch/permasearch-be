Following his historic third Oscar win, there was much debate about Day-Lewis' standing among the greatest actors in the history of cinema.[52][59] Joe Queenan in The Guardian stated, "Arguing whether Daniel Day-Lewis is a greater actor than Laurence Olivier, or Richard Burton, or Marlon Brando, is like arguing whether Messi is more talented than Pel√©, whether Napoleon Bonaparte edges out Alexander the Great as a military genius."[59] Day-Lewis himself when asked what it was like to be "the world's greatest actor", responded "It's daft isn't it? It changes all the time".[60] Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln, Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting, retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow, Ireland for the next five years, before making another film.[61]
