In 2004, it was demonstrated that rats' alarm pheromones had different effects on the "recipient" rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat's anal area induced autonomic nervous system stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature.[61] Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior,[62] and its acoustic startle reflex was enhanced.
