The varicella vaccine is recommended in many countries.[10] Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose is recommended five years after the initial immunization.[36] A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected.[37] Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children.[11]
