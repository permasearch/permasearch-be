Originally, a cohort consisted of six centuriae, each commanded by a centurion assisted by junior officers. At various times prior to the reforms, a century might have 60 to 100 men. The cohort had no permanent commander; it is assumed that in combat, the most senior centurion of the six would have commanded the entire cohort.[citation needed] In order of seniority, the six centurions were titled hastatus posterior, hastatus prior, princeps posterior, princeps prior, pilus posterior and pilus prior (most senior).
