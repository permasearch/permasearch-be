British royal residences are palaces, castles and houses occupied by members of the British royal family in the United Kingdom. Some, like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, are owned by the monarch by virtue of his or her position as king or queen, while others like Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House are personally owned,[1] and they have been passed down for generations. Some royal palaces are no longer residences (e.g., the Palace of Westminster and the Palace of Whitehall). Some remain in irregular use for royal occasions, such as Hillsborough Castle.
