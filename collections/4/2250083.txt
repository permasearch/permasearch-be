Monk and Natalie attempt to break the bad news to Stottlemeyer, but he refuses to be convinced, thinking Monk is being motivated out of pure jealousy, forgetting that Monk is always right when it comes to accusing someone of murder. Natalie tries to help convince him, but Stottlemeyer refuses to listen to another word. Fuming, he tells them "I'm gonna do you a favor... and pretend that this conversation never happened." This leaves Monk and Natalie in a compromising position, as they need more evidence against Linda to secure an arrest.
