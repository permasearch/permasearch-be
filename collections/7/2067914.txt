Joyce noted in a 1921 letter to Frank Budgen that "[t]he last word (human, all too human) is left to Penelope." The episode both begins and ends with "yes," a word that Joyce described as "the female word" and that he said indicated "acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance."[1] This last, clear "yes" stands in sharp contrast to her unintelligible first spoken line in the fourth chapter of the novel.
