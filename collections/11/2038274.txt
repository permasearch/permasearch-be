Before and during his presidency, Roosevelt built up a strong following within the Republican Party, but his re-nomination in 1904 was far from certain at the end of 1901.[175] Many expected Senator Mark Hanna, a confidante of former President McKinley, to win the party's 1904 presidential nomination.[176] Support for Hanna was especially strong among conservative businessmen who opposed many of Roosevelt's policies.[177] However, Hanna lacked his own national organization, and even in his home state he was opposed by influential Senator Joseph Foraker.[178] Other potential rivals for the nomination, including Leslie Shaw and Charles W. Fairbanks, failed to galvanize support for their candidacies.[175] With the death of Hanna and Matthew Quay in 1904, and with the waning of Thomas C. Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination.[179] At the 1904 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R. Hitt, was not nominated.[180] Senator Fairbanks, a favorite of conservatives, gained the vice-presidential nomination.[179]
