Where      m  1     {\displaystyle m_{1}}   represents the rest mass of the first colliding body,      m  2     {\displaystyle m_{2}}   represents the rest mass of the second colliding body,      u  1     {\displaystyle u_{1}}   represents the initial velocity of the first colliding body,      u  2     {\displaystyle u_{2}}   represents the initial velocity of the second colliding body,      v  1     {\displaystyle v_{1}}   represents the velocity after collision of the first colliding body,      v  2     {\displaystyle v_{2}}   represents the velocity after collision of the second colliding body,      p  1     {\displaystyle p_{1}}   denotes the momentum of the first colliding body,      p  2     {\displaystyle p_{2}}   denotes the momentum of the second colliding body and     c   {\displaystyle c}   denotes the speed of light in vacuum,     E   {\displaystyle E}   denotes the total energy of the system (i.e. the sum of rest masses and kinetic energies of the colliding bodies).
