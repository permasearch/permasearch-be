Lemurs are unusual among primates for their rapid dental development, particularly among the largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption.[84] By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development.[79] Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.[36]
