In An Essay on the Principle of Population, Thomas Robert Malthus argues that a population will increase exponentially if unchecked, while resources will only increase arithmetically.[3] This is seen graphically in the adjacent image and is commonly referred to as the Malthusian curve. Malthus knew that with limited resources on earth, there would be competition among people to exist and survive. He coined the phrase the Malthusian catastrophe to explain how there were positive checks in human populations like famine and disease that kept the population from rising too quickly.[24] The checks that exist on the human population growth result in a struggle for existence.[3] Malthus also notes that the checks on the human population are more complicated than those on animals and plants.[25] Malthus explains, for example, that a human check on population growth is the conscious decision not to reproduce because of financial burden.[25] Malthus then explains that the main check on population growth is food. In periods of high food availability the population increases, while in periods of food shortages, the population decreases.[26] Thus, "population [growth] tends to oscillate around its means of subsistence."[27] The combination of Malthus' "law of multiplication in geometrical progression" and "the law of limited population" leads to the idea of the struggle for existence.[3] Despite these ideas, Malthus was a religious man and believed in divine laws that governed the natural world.[2]
