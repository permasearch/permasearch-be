USCYBERCOM was created in 2009 at the National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. It uses NSA networks and has been headed by the Director of the National Security Agency since its inception.[1] While originally created with a defensive mission in mind, it has increasingly been viewed as an offensive force.[1] On 18 August 2017, it was announced that USCYBERCOM is to be elevated to the status of a full and independent Unified Combatant Command.[2]
