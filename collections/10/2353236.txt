Ford introduced the 239 cu in (3.9 L) V8-99A engine with 3.1875 by 3.75 in (80.96 by 95.25 mm) bore and stroke and 6.15:1 compression in 1939.[14] It produced 95 hp (71 kW) and 170 lb⋅ft (230 N⋅m).[14] This was done to provide a more powerful engine for the Mercury cars, which Ford Motor Company started making in 1939. It  was used in Mercurys in 1939 and in Fords in 1946. This engine is very similar to the late 221 engine. As the V8-09A in 1940, compression, power, and torque were unchanged; in 1941, the V8-19A compression and power were static, but torque rose by 6 lb⋅ft (8.1 N⋅m), while the 1942 V8-29A increased compression to 6.4:1 and power to 100 hp (75 kW), while torque stayed the same.[14] Postwar, it became the V8-69 (suffixed "A" in Fords, "M" in Mercurys), with compression 6.75:1, 100 hp (75 kW), and 180 lb⋅ft (240 N⋅m).[14] For 1947 and 1948, only the designation changed, to V8-79 and -89.[14] The 239 was redesigned in 1948 as the 8RT for Ford trucks and in 1949 as the 8BA for the cars. It had higher 6.8:1 compression, but performance was unchanged.[14] The 1950 V8-0BA boosted torque by 1 lb⋅ft (1.4 N⋅m), the 1951 -1BA by 6 lb⋅ft (8.1 N⋅m) more, while in 1952, as the V8-B2, compression climbed to 7.2:1, power to 110 hp (82 kW), and torque to 194 lb⋅ft (263 N⋅m), then to 196 lb⋅ft (266 N⋅m) in the -B3 of 1953, its final year.[14] The 1948 to 1953 engines have a revised cooling and ignition system. Collectively all 239 engines are referred to as "100 horse" engines, although the horsepower was increased in 1952 to 110 horsepower in cars and 106 horsepower in trucks. This engine was used in Ford's transit buses during the most productive years of the company's short stint in the transit bus business from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, most notably in the 1939–1947 version of the Ford Transit Bus.
