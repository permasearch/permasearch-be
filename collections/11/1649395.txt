At the Premier League Annual General Meeting, delegates from Manchester United and Arsenal spoke in favour of the Liverpool proposal, as did West Ham United's joint chairman David Gold, who commented, "I was involved in bringing in the FFP rules in the Championship and at the time I thought should I get to the Premier League, Iâ€™ll lobby for it. Even the big clubs now are saying we have to get to grips with costs."
