Shaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although weâ€™ll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)
