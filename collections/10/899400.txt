The A.V. Club critic Todd VanDerWerff commented on the improved quality that the fifth season of 30 Rock had demonstrated, attributing it to the show "rediscovering its sense of playfulness". He praised the primary plot, commenting that "the Liz storyline was unexpectedly moving, as Lizâ€™s farcical attempts to get Tracy to come back [...] led to the revelation that Angie has been trying to get Tracy to come back to no avail". However, he also noted that the episode's format crowded out a number of storylines, including the one featuring Susan Sarandon.[4]
