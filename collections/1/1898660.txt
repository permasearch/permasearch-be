Past Kingston, the highway runs closer to the river as it parallels U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) through the towns of Saugerties, Catskill, Coxsackie, and Ravena. Just north of Ravena, the Thruway meets the west end of the Berkshire Connector, a spur linking the Thruway mainline to the Massachusetts Turnpike 25 miles (40 km) to the east. The highway continues into Albany, where it connects to Troy via I-787 at exit 23 and intersects I-90 at exit 24.[10] The latter of the two junctions is the busiest of the Thruway's exits, serving an estimated 27 million vehicles a year.[11] I-87 leaves the Thruway mainline here while I-90 merges into it, following the Thruway northwestward toward Schenectady.[10]
