Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings many times in the 10th century, and how the book survived is not known.[12] The earliest historical reference to the book, and indeed to the book's presence at Kells, can be found in a 1007 entry in the Annals of Ulster. This entry records that "the great Gospel of Columkille, (Columba)[13] the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine".[1][14] The manuscript was recovered a few months later—minus its golden and bejewelled cover—"under a sod".[15] It is generally assumed that the "great Gospel of Columkille" is the Book of Kells.[16] If this is correct, then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence. The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. The description in the Annals of the book as "of Columkille"—that is, having belonged to, and perhaps being made by Columba—suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona.[17]
