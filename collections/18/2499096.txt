RKO Radio Pictures' Encino, California movie ranch consisted of 89 acres (360,000Â m2) located near the Los Angeles River and west of Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area on Burbank Boulevard, in the outskirts of the Los Angeles suburb Encino, which is in the San Fernando Valley section of the city of Los Angeles. RKO Radio Pictures purchased this property as a location to film its epic motion picture Cimarron (1931), (winner of three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Art Direction). Art Director Max Ree won an Oscar for his creative design of the very first theme sets constructed on the movie ranch, which consisted of a complete Western town and a three-block modern main street built as the fictional Oklahoma town of Osage.
