As part of the new American administration's policy on Afghanistan it was announced that 17,000 new U.S. troops would be deployed to the country with a third stationed in Kandahar province.[17] On 10 August 2009, Brig-Gen. Jonathan Vance of Task Force Kandahar transferred authority of some of Kandahar Province to Col. Harry Tunnell IV, commander of the U.S. army's 5th Stryker Brigade. Canadian troops were then stationed primarily around Kandahar City and the surrounding districts.[18]
