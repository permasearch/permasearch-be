As the universe expanded and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separate from each other. These can be regarded as phase transitions much like condensation and freezing phase transitions of ordinary matter. The grand unification epoch began when gravitation separated from the gauge forces. The non-gravitational physics of this epoch would be described by a so-called grand unified theory (GUT). The grand unification epoch ended when the GUT forces separated into the strong and electroweak forces.
