During the early spring of 1791, Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant began working on a plan for the capital city that identified the future sites of the "Congress House" (the United States Capitol) and the "President's House" (the White House).[19] Design competitions were then held to solicit designs for each of those structures. Architect James Hoban was selected to design the President's House, while no satisfactory drawings were submitted for the Capitol.[20] A late submission by William Thornton was selected for the Capitol.[21][22] Stephen Hallet was hired to oversee construction, which got underway in September 1793. Hallet proceeded to make alterations to the design, against the wishes of Washington and Jefferson, and was subsequently dismissed. George Hadfield was hired in October 1795 as superintendent of construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, due to dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.[23]
