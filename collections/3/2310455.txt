The Tasmanian Government bought the Tasmanian Main Line Company in 1890, creating the Tasmanian Government Railways. In 1901 the line to Devonport line was extended to Burnie, connecting with the Emu Bay Railway's line to Zeehan. Other branches were built but the Tasmanian system has always been small and unprofitable. Currently operated by the Tasmanian Government owned Tasrail, previous owners include Australian National, Australian Transport Network and most recently, Pacific National.
