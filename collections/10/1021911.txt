Lilly sees Dana and Rich kissing, and proudly announces to Frank and Carol that Rich and Dana are going to have a baby. Lilly's parents tell her the facts of life, which she then shares during "show and tell" at school. This causes a conflict between Frank and Carol and Devon (David Kaufman) and Tiffany (Lisa Picotte, Kaufman's real-life wife), the parents of Lilly's best friend Joey. They agree to overlook their differences for their children. Meanwhile, after Jean-Luc tutors Al in French, he notices that J.T. and Rich are into horse-racing and helps them win some money. But when they want to empty their college funds, he's forced to teach them an invaluable lesson about gambling and introduces them to a bookie, Tony (Tony Longo).
