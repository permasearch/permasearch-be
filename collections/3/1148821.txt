A camera phone is a mobile phone which is able to capture photographs and often record video using one or more built-in digital cameras.  The first camera phone was sold in 2000 in Japan, a Sharp J-SH04 J-Phone model, although some argue that the SCH-V200 and Kyocera VP-210 Visual Phone, both introduced months earlier in South Korea and Japan respectively, are the first camera phones.[1]
