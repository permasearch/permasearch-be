Elagabalus used his authority to install El-Gabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon, merging the god with the Roman sun gods to form Deus Sol Invictus, meaning God - the Undefeated Sun, and making him superior to Jupiter,[4] and assigning either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some combination of the three, as El-Gabal's wife.[5] He rode roughshod over other elements of traditional religion, marrying a Vestal Virgin[6] (who were legally required to remain unmarried virgins during their service),[7] and moved the most sacred relics of Roman religion (including the fire of Vesta, the Shields of the Salii, and the Palladium) to a new temple dedicated exclusively to El-Gabal.[8] As much as the religiously conservative senators may have disapproved, the lavish annual public festivals held in El-Gabal's honour found favour among the popular masses, partly on account of the festivals involving the wide distribution of food.[5]
