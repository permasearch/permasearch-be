According to Averroes, there are two methods of teaching virtue to citizens; persuasion and coercion.[58] Persuasion is the more natural method consisting of rhetorical, dialectical and demonstrative methods; sometimes, however, coercion is necessary for those not amenable to persuasion, e.g. enemies of the state.[58] Therefore, he justifies war as a last resort, which he also supports using Quranic arguments.[58] Consequently, he argues that a ruler should have both wisdom and courage, which are needed for governance and defense of the state.[59]
