In the 2000s, the terms "mid-season finale", "fall finale" and "winter finale" began being used by some cable and broadcast networks in the United States, to denote the last episode in the first half of a split television season, ahead of a break in the broadcast schedule in order to make room for a mid-season replacement series, or to simply demarcate the interregnum between November sweeps and the end of the Christmas/Hanukkah/New Year holiday period, when most regular programming is in hiatus.
