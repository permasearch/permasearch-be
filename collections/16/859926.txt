Khondji employed large tungsten lighting units, including 18K HMIs, dino and Wendy lights.[43] He used Arriflex's VariCon, which functions as an illuminated filter, and incorporated much more lens filtration than he had on previous projects. Technicolor's ENR silver retention, when combined with the VariCon, was used to control the contrast and black density of the film's release prints.[43] The finished film features 299 scenes and 3,000 shots from 320,000 feet (98,000Â m) of film.[5]
