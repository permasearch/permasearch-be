Patton's "big break" came in 2002, when he was cast to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's television program Blue's Clues. He was up for a part in Blair Witch Project 2 at the time, but considered the role as Joe "a happy accident".[3] Patton became a "household name"[2] and has been called "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents".[3] He was subjected to "the same kind of scrutiny" as Burns, who was involved in Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role.[4] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions.[5][6] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences.[7] He said, "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. There's a tape out there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists".[8] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to "think of [the show] as children's TV", but rather as "acting and telling the truth".[1]
