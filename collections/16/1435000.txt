After a year at RADA, Morrissey went back to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse.[15] He then did Le Cid and Twelfth Night with Cheek by Jowl, and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with director Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in King John in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had often wondered at RADA if he would ever have the chance to act in classical theatre.[15] His performance has been described as "the most contentious characterisation of the production"; he received negative critical reaction from Daily Telegraph and Independent critics, but a positive opinion from the Financial Times.[24] In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, "The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking."[25] Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in Peer Gynt (1990).[26] Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance.[27] During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.[28][29]
