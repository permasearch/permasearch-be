One day some children found a strange object in a ravine, and they sold it to a passerby for a penny, who then sold it to a curiosity shop. Eventually the object found its way to the king, and the king was very curious to know what it was. He called together his wise men, and they discovered that the object, about the size of a hen's egg, was actually a large grain.
