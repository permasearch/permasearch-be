The film was mostly shot in New York City, with Sophie's flashback scenes shot afterwards in Yugoslavia.[6] Production for the film at times was more like a theatrical set than a film set. Pakula allowed the cast to rehearse for three weeks and was open to improvisation from the actors, "spontaneous things" according to Streep.[6] Streep had to lose a lot of weight to film the scenes in Yugoslavia at the concentration camp.
