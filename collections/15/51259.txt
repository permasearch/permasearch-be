The names of the days of the week are modeled on the seven days mentioned in the creation story. For example, Genesis 1:5 "... And there was evening and there was morning, one day". One day (יוֹם אֶחָד‬) in Genesis 1:15 is translated in JPS as first day, and in some other contexts (including KJV) as day one. In subsequent verses, the Hebrew refers to the days using ordinal numbers, e.g., 'second day', 'third day', and so forth, but with the sixth and seventh days the Hebrew includes the definite article ("the").[9]
