As his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the Movimiento would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The death of prime minister Luis Carrero Blanco on 20 December 1973 in a bombing by ETA eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction. On 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as Acting Head of State. Franco soon recovered, and on 2 September he resumed his duties as Head of State. One year later he fell ill once again from more health problems, including a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when he, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, gave a speech to crowds in Oriente Square in Madrid. On 30 October 1975, he fell into a coma and was put on life support. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 — the same date as the death of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange. The historian Ricardo de la Cierva claimed that he had been told, around 6 pm on 19 November, that Franco had already died.
