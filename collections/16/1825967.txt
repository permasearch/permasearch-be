The music of Japan includes a wide array of performers in distinct styles both traditional and modern. The word for music in Japanese is 音楽 (ongaku), combining the kanji 音 "on" (sound) with the kanji 楽 "gaku" (enjoyment).[1] Japan is the second largest music market in the world, behind the United States, and the largest in Asia,[2] and most of the market is dominated by Japanese artists.[citation needed]
