Following the Revolution, the northern states all abolished slavery, with New Jersey acting last in 1804. In states that passed gradual abolition laws, such as New York and New Jersey, children born to slave mothers had to serve an extended period of indenture into young adulthood. In other cases, some slaves were reclassified as indentured servants, effectively maintaining slavery by another name.[67] These state jurisdictions enacted the first abolition laws in the entire New World.[68]
