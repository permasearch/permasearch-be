Nick Meyer wrote in the New York magazine that Feynman departs from his field of theoretical physics and "waxes philosophical" on "the strengths and limitations of scientific thought", using topics like "poverty, religion, and flying saucers" to illustrate his arguments.[12] Meyer said that Feynman "sounds like himself, which is a high compliment."[12] Chris Quigg, a theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, said that The Meaning of It All is an opportunity to "ponder and debate [Feynman's] ideas".[3] Quigg said it is also an "unspoken challenge" to other scientists to consider the "cultural and spiritual value of science".[3]
