Early Islamic philosophers initially agreed with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye.[122] This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed,[121][123][124] and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies.[124][125] He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses.[126] Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.[127]
