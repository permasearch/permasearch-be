Halo 3: ODST ships as a two-disc set. The first disc contains the campaign mode as well as the Firefight co-op mode, while the second disc contains the multiplayer mode with the complete set of Halo 3 maps. Owners of the game received an invitation to participate in the Halo: Reach multiplayer beta, which went live on May 3, 2010. Pre-orders included a token to unlock Avery Johnson as a playable character in the Firefight multiplayer mode. This code was included only by certain retailers.[69] A special edition "Collector's Pack" contained the game and a special ODST-branded wireless Xbox 360 Controller.[70] Toys "R" Us offered an ODST action figure and a US$20 gift card as a buying incentive.[71]
