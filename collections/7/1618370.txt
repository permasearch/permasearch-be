While many accipitrids are not known for their strong voices, golden eagles have a particular tendency for silence, even while breeding.[23] Some vocalisation, however, has been recorded, and these normally are centering on the nesting period. The voice of the golden eagle is considered weak, high and shrill, has been called "quite pathetic" and "puppy-like", and seems incongruous with the formidable size and nature of the species.[5] Most known vocalisations seem to function as contact calls between eagles, sometimes adults to their offspring, occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely between a breeding pair. In Western Montana, nine distinct calls were noted: a chirp, a seeir, a pssa, a skonk, a cluck, a wonk, a honk and a hiss.[24]
