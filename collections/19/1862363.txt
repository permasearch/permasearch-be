Warner aids ADA Casey Novak in forming a case against a New York psychiatrist who tortured prisoners in Iraq. Warner and FBI forensic psychiatrist George Huang argue about the legality and integrity of what the psychiatrist did, and Warner convinces Novak that the psychiatrist could be charged with criminally negligent homicide as the doctor knew that she was harming the prisoners. Warner and Novak succeed in getting the doctor's license suspended.[2]
