A commercial variation of the dictionary test is known as "Flashback," and comes in the form of a complete gimmicked book. Instead of the word appearing faintly at the top of the page, it is arranged so the last word on the left page is the same as the first word on the right page. In some forms the antonym appears on the mirror page, instead of the same word. For instance, if the word "day" appears as the first word on the left page, a straight flashback would put the word "day" on the left page, while an antonym version puts "night" there instead. Flashback variations are often incorporated in gimmick books supporting other methods as well.
