In the 1970s the game involved two players winding fists around each other. At "Pull, Pull" they pushed their fists away from each other and when "Tug, Tug" was reached they pulled their elbows back.[2] It has now become a much more sedate action game, often with small children carrying out the actions in the lyrics.[1]
