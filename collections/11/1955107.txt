Thinking that the worst is over, Denise invites Jay to join her and Cheryl at the Whiskey a Go-Go to hear Doris (who embarked on a solo career in LA when The Luminaries broke up) and her new boyfriend sing.  Jay begs off, saying he's got a song idea he wants to explore.  He promises a night of lovemaking when she returns. While the women celebrate, Jay is revealed to be still in the throes of his depression; having put on a brave face for Denise's benefit.  He walks into the ocean, taking his own life.  Denise is further distraught to discover that Jay's fans blame her for not stopping his death.
