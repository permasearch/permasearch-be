In Peppers second season, he was part of a defensive line that also included Brentson Buckner, Kris Jenkins, and Mike Rucker. Together, the unit would be a key cog that would help the Panthers reach the Super Bowl. As great as the defensive line was, Peppers was the clear attention getter on the defensive line by opposing teams offenses, and would take on double teams to help free up his fellow defensive lineman.[12] Peppers would finish the season with 37 solo tackles, 7 assisted tackles, 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 3 passes defensed, 4 stuffs, and 1 blocked kick.
