To reduce optical visibility during daylight flights, the B-2 is painted in an anti-reflective paint.[75] The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (50,000 ft or 15,000 m), and at that altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing light sensor which alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky.[96] The original design had tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude.[97] The B-2 is vulnerable to visual interception at ranges of 20 nmi (23 mi; 37 km) or less.[64]
