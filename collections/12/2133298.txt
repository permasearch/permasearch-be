Construction work is in progress for Tottenham to move to a new stadium with an estimated capacity of 61,000,[7] with the new stadium being built on the current site instead of moving elsewhere or from the borough of Haringey. The new stadium has been designed by Populous, which also designed derby rival Arsenal's home, the Emirates Stadium. Initial designs were created by KSS Design Group back in 2008, but long delays allowed for major changes to the scheme by a different company.[8]
