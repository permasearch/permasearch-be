Male ridgebacks usually stand 25–27 in (64–69 cm) at the withers and weigh about 85 lb (39 kg) (FCI standard); females are typically 24–26 inches (61–66 cm) tall and about 70 lb (32 kg) in weight. Ridgebacks are typically muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky.[22]
