By the end of the 1960s, particularly after releasing Tommy in May 1969, The Who had become cited by many as one of the best live rock acts in the world. According to biographer Chris Charlesworth, "a sixth sense seemed to take over", leading them to "a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about".[4] The band were rehearsing and touring regularly, and Townshend had settled on using the Gibson SG as his main touring instrument; it allowed him to play faster than did other guitars.[5] He began using Hiwatt amplifiers that allowed him to get a variety of tones simply by adjusting the guitar's volume level.[6][a]
