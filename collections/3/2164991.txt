Hannah/Miley refuses, so Jackson seeks help from his dad, who says to Miley/Hannah, "Think about it this way, he goes out with the girl, they fall in love, they get married and move out." Hannah then agrees. The phone rings and Miley's best friend, Lilly (Emily Osment) is on the line. She says "incoming in 20 seconds" and Hannah/Miley takes her Hannah wig off and puts a blue jacket over her Hannah clothes. Lilly enters on a skateboard. She says "I have two incredible tickets to the one, the only, Hannah Montana!"
