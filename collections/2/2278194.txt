Seabirds such as terns and gulls that feed at the surface or plunge for food have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas. This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions.[2] Birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil droplets than other species.[23]
