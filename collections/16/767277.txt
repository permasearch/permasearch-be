Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides.[2] The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall slightly more than 40 metres tall[3] that can seat 1,300 people[10] and hold up to 2,500 in all.[4] The surface of the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble from which many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon[10]) and other Bahá'í Houses of Worship are built.[11] Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m²; 10.5 ha).
