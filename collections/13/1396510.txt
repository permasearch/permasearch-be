In a panic, the man runs through the streets, even more paranoid that he is being watched, until he finally collapses next to a street crossing and presses a button labeled WALK. As he screams for someone to help him, it is revealed that the walk button is actually a panic button. The man is not alone in a deserted town, but is instead in an isolation booth being observed by a group of uniformed servicemen. Along with the panic button, the isolation booth shows a clock with its glass shattered from the man pounding on it.
