One of the largest alternative rebel assemblies in Darfur is the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA), which has split into two factions according to their leaders: Abdul Wahid and Minni Minawi.[23] Both groups employ tools of hard power in their offensives. The Sudanese Bloc to Liberate the Republic (SBLR) as well as the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) used to be independent organizations but have recently joined forces with JEM. As the Northern counter to the already existing SPLA, the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) was created. In 2011, all of these have combined to form the Sudan Revolutionary Front (DRF).[24]
