Online health communities is one example of online communities which is heavily used by internet users.[47][48][49] A key benefit of online health communities is providing user access to other users with similar problems or experiences which has a significant impact on the lives of their members.[47] Through people participation, online health communities will be able to offer patients opportunities for emotional support[50][51] and also will provide them access to experience-based information about particular problem or possible treatment strategies. Even in some studies, it is shown that users find experienced-based information more relevant than information which was prescribed by professionals.[52][53][54] Moreover, allowing patients to collaborate anonymously in some of online health communities suggests users a non-judgmental environment to share their problems, knowledge, and experiences.[55]
