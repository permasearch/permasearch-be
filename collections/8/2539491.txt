New York City has been a leading center of finance in the world economy since the end of World War I.[22] As of August, 2008 the city's financial services industry employs 344,700 workers.[23] In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, New York City was ranked as having the second most competitive financial center in the world after London (and alongside cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto).[24] Manhattan is home to six major stock, commodities, and futures exchanges: American Stock Exchange, International Securities Exchange, NASDAQ, New York Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, and New York Stock Exchange. This contributes to New York City being a major financial service exporter, both within the United States and globally.
