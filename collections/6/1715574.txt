It now featured the 160 hp (119 kW), 3.0-liter VG30E V6, with the 190 hp (142 kW), VE30DE unit standard on the SE model starting in 1991. In the United States, the VG30E engine, which featured a variable intake manifold on both automatic and manual transmission models, was used on all 1989 to 1994 GXE models and 1989 to 1991 SE models. This generation Maxima was fitted with an independent rear suspension, and continued to offer the road scanning, electronic Super Sonic Suspension (sonar). An interesting feature was the digital touch entry system on the GXE (in conjunction with the new Luxury Package), which allowed the windows to be lowered and the moon roof opened from outside the vehicle on a keypad integrated on the front door handle without the key in the ignition.
