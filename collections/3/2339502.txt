Carragher learned to shun the spotlight and focus on football instead as new manager Gérard Houllier used him consistently in a new continental side focused on discipline.[17] In his autobiography, Carragher admitted that "I always felt close to Gérard", and was full of praise for the French manager during the early part of his reign.[18] He went on to make 44 appearances in the 1998–99 season, and was named as the club's Player of the Year.[19]
