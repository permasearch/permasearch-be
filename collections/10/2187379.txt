Brett Goodkin, the chief investigator in the case, was approached as a consultant for The Bling Ring, Sofia Coppola's film adaptation of the case. He was later offered the opportunity to play himself in the film. However, he was allegedly not granted permission from his superiors to work on the film, and his involvement led to his being investigated. A potential conflict of interest was cited, because at the time that he was working with the filmmakers, the cases against the defendants involved had not yet been resolved.[41][42]
