The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group within the department whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a hotshot crew in 2008.[5] The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment, including two 10-person crew carriers, was housed.[6] The 2017 film Only the Brave was based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Fire.
