For every android they create, they test its reaction to the gynoids stripping; the first android has a meltdown; the second flirts with a male doctor (a cameo of Fedde le Grand) instead of looking at the girls; the third time it works, but he discovers that he is a robot instead of human so he escapes, causing a system shutdown protocol to be activated, shutting down the gynoids. After this the runaway android is shutdown by remote terminate.
