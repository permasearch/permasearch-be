This formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature, nor even entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but it implies the content of the second law. A closely related statement is that "Frictional pressure never does positive work."[42] Using a now-obsolete form of words, Planck himself wrote: "The production of heat by friction is irreversible."[43][44]
