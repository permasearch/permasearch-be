In 2015, about 11.8 million maternal infections occurred.[3] In the developed world about one to two percent develop uterine infections following vaginal delivery.[1] This increases to five to thirteen percent among those who have more difficult deliveries and fifty percent with C-sections before the use of preventative antibiotics.[1] In 2015, these infections resulted in 17,900 deaths down from 34,000 deaths in 1990.[4][6] They are the cause of about 10% of deaths around the time of pregnancy.[2] The first known descriptions of the condition date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates.[7] These infections were a very common cause of death around the time of childbirth starting in at least the 18th century until the 1930s when antibiotics were introduced.[8] In 1847, in Austria, Ignaz Semmelweiss through the use of handwashing with chlorine decreased death from the disease from nearly twenty percent to two percent.[9][10]
