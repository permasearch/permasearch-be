Beta-lactamases are enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) produced by bacteria that provide multi-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins,  cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a β-lactam. Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.
