Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas,[91] as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology.[92] The 1977 flag of Libya consisted of a simple green field with no other characteristics. It was the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design, insignia, or other details.[93] Some countries used green in their flags to represent their country's lush vegetation, as in the flag of Jamaica,[94] and hope in the future, as in the flags of Portugal and Nigeria.[95] The green cedar of Lebanon tree on the Flag of Lebanon officially represents steadiness and tolerance.[96]
