Waterway commerce was historically important to Europe, particularly to Russia.[84] According to the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (2002): "Russia has been a significant beneficiary. Not only have inland waterways opened vast areas of its interior to development, but Moscow-linked to the White, Baltic, Black, Caspian, and Azov seas by canals and rivers-has become a major inland port."[84]
