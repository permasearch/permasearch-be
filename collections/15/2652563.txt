"In the Middle of the House" is a novelty song written by Bob Hilliard. It was performed by Vaughn Monroe and separately by Rusty Draper in 1956. Each was released as a single. Monroe's version reached number 11 on Billboard Magazine's Most Played by Jockeys chart and number 21 on the magazine's Top 100 chart in September 1956. Draper's version, released only weeks later, peaked lower on the Most Played by Jockeys chart, climbing to number 24. Draper outdid Monroe by one spot on the Top 100, peaking at number 20.[1] The song was quite popular in the UK as it was covered by Alma Cogan (# 20), Jimmy Parkinson (# 20) and the Johnston Brothers (# 27). All versions were in the UK charts simultaneously in November 1956.
