The song was played in the 1995 Brazilian soap opera A Próxima Vítima, in the 1997 movie Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, in the 1998 movie A Night at the Roxbury, in the 1999 movie Earthly Possessions, in an episode of the sitcom Step by Step. It was also spoofed as "One Zero 001" on the computers-themed episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy and used in Audition Online Dance Battle as a song. It can be vaguely heard in the background in the "World's Greatest Dick" episode of the 3rd Rock from the Sun, in the Gay Bar that Sally and Harry walk into at the beginning of the episode.
