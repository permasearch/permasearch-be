"There has been only one significant Second Amendment case decided by the Supreme Court -- United States v. Miller, in 1939, where the National Firearms Act was upheld against a man who claimed that the amendment allowed him to keep and bear a sawed-off shotgun. The Court declared that a sawed-off shotgun is not a militia weapon."Inijones (talk) 14:35, 29 April 2012 (UTC)
