Multi-point fuel injection (single port) became standard on the 3.8 L V6 in 1988. All applications where the engine was used initially put out 140 horsepower (100 kW) at 3800 rpm and 215 lb⋅ft (292 N⋅m) of torque at 2400 rpm. Engines upgraded with Ford's EEC-V Powertrain Control Module (PCM) received a small increase in output to 155 horsepower (116 kW), if they did not have other enhancements to increase output beyond this already. The 1991–1995 Police Package Taurus, 1991–1994 Lincoln Continental and 1995 Ford Windstar had a high-output version of the 3.8 with better cylinder heads and other modifications. It produced 155–160 hp (116–119 kW) and 220–225 lb·ft (298–305 N·m) of torque depending on application and model year. A supercharged version of the 3.8 L V6 was used in the 1989–1995 Thunderbird Super Coupe and 1989–90 Cougar XR-7. Initial output of the engine was 210 horsepower (160 kW) at 4000 rpm and 315 lb⋅ft (427 N⋅m) of torque at 2600 rpm under an 8.2:1 compression ratio. The Super Coupe was the sole user of this engine after the beginning of the 1991 model year when it was replaced by a V8 in the Cougar XR-7. Output of the supercharged V6 was increased to 230 horsepower (170 kW) at 4400 rpm and 330 lb⋅ft (447 N⋅m) of torque at 2500 rpm for the 1994 and 1995 Super Coupe. To accomplish this, the engine's Eaton M90 roots-type supercharger was given a larger, square-style inlet, a larger attaching inlet plenum, and Teflon coated rotors. Additionally, the engine received larger fuel injectors and an increase in compression to 8.6:1.
