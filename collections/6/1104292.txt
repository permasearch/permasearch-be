In February 2014, it was reported that ITV were attempting to recruit Reid for their new breakfast programme, with a £1 million salary.[17] Reid had previously rejected claims of moving to ITV in December 2013, during her Strictly Come Dancing stint, claiming she would "bleed BBC" if cut open.[18] On 3 March 2014, the BBC confirmed Reid's move to ITV to front rival breakfast programme Good Morning Britain, which replaced its former breakfast show Daybreak. She co-hosts the show alongside Ben Shephard and Piers Morgan every Monday to Thursday from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.[19] It was not until she began working with Morgan that Reid "understood the real definition of a love-hate relationship!"[20]
