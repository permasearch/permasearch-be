The energy needed to break a specific bond (generally covalent) between two atoms known as bond energy is a result of all the relative attractions and repulsions between the atoms of the molecule, however the most relevant are the bond's atoms and the immediate neighbors. As an approximation the most important parameters that influence the bonding between two atoms in a molecule are the mutual energy match and overlap of covalent orbitals and the repulsion between nonbonding orbitals. Likewise, radicals requiring more energy to form are less stable than those requiring less energy. An additional barrier can be the selection rule. Propagation, however, is very exothermic.
