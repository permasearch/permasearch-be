In the episode "Furt", when Finn's mother marries Kurt's father and the glee club provides music for the wedding, two of the songs are by Bruno Mars: "Marry You", which is sung by the entire club as a big processional production number, and "Just the Way You Are", which is sung by Finn to Kurt at the reception. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized the "two Bruno Mars songs" as "brilliant in execution and touching in sentiment",[52] and Futterman agreed: "the Bruno Mars songs gave the show two of its best performances this season".[53] While Benigno and Stack also praised "Just the Way You Are", and both gave the song an "A",[54][55] Jen Harper of BuddyTV thought Monteith's vocals as Finn "aren't the strongest" and AOL TV's Jean Bentley also wished Finn had not been the soloist.[56] In "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", Finn led his football teammates, some of whom were performing with the glee club under duress, in The Zombies' "She's Not There". VanDerWerff called it "one of the better numbers of the season",[57] and Futterman felt that Monteith's vocals were a "perfect fit" for the song.[58] Finn's sole duet with Quinn, Fleetwood Mac's "I Don't Want to Know" from the episode "Rumours", was given an "Aâˆ’" by Entertainment Weekly's Sandra Gonzalez,[59] and Futterman said it was "better than Quinn and Sam's 'Lucky'",[60] which she had called "charming" when it was performed in "Duets".[61]
