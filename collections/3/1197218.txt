In July 2014 California became the first state to put into effect a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for hexavalent chromium, or chromium-6, in drinking water setting the rate at 10 parts per billion (ppb). In setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in "recent scientific studies in laboratory animals, Hexavalent Chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested."[citation needed] Previously, when older chromium MCLs were set, "at the time Total Chromium MCLs were established, ingested Hexavalent Chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk, as is now the case."[31]
