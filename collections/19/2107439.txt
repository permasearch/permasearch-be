Healing Stone is a black Lorien stone that heals injuries caused with the intent to hurt or kill, but when used it causes double the pain of the original injury. A healing stone would not heal older or accidental injuries. It is assumed it was dumped into the well at the Sanctuary at the end of "The Revenge of Seven"
