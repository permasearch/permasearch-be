A classic example of a random walk is known as the simple random walk, which is a stochastic process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say,     p   {\displaystyle p}  , or decreases by negative one with probability     1 âˆ’ p   {\displaystyle 1-p}  , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the     p = 0.5   {\displaystyle p=0.5}  , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.[72][73]
