In September 2004, IDW Publications began publishing a series of Metal Gear Solid comics,[82] written by Kris Oprisko and illustrated by Ashley Wood.[83] As of 2006, 12 issues have been published, fully covering the Metal Gear Solid storyline.[84] The comic was adapted into a PlayStation Portable game titled Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel (Metal Gear Solid: Bande Dessinée in Japan).[85] It features visual enhancements and two interactive modes designed to give further insight into the publication.[86] Upon viewing the pages, the player can open a "scanning" interface to search for characters and items in a three-dimensional view.[86] Discoveries are added to a database which can be traded with other players via Wi-Fi. The "mission mode" allows the player to add collected information into a library. This information must be properly connected to complete a mission. Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel was released in North America on June 13, 2006, Japan on September 21 and the PAL region on September 22.[87] In 2006, the game received IGN's award for Best Use of Sound on the PSP.[88] A DVD-Video version is included with its sequel (Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée), which was released in Japan on June 12, 2008. The DVD version features full voice acting.[89]
