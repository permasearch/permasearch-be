Many Polish legends  are connected with the Vistula and the beginnings of Polish statehood. One of the most enduring is that about princess Wanda co nie chciała Niemca (who rejected the German).[23] According to the most popular variant, popularized by the 15th-century historian Jan Długosz,[24] Wanda, daughter of King Krak, became queen of the Poles upon her father's death.[23] She refused to marry a German prince Rytigier (Rüdiger), who took offence and invaded Poland, but was repelled.[25] Wanda however committed suicide, drowning in the Vistula river, to ensure he would not invade her country again.[25]
