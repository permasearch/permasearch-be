The kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls, and that all energy is translational kinetic energy. Using a sophisticated symmetry argument,[70] Boltzmann deduced what is now called the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann probability distribution function for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas. From that probability distribution function, the average kinetic energy, Ek (per particle), of a monatomic ideal gas is:[66][71]
