A key issue when designing a distributed SDN control plane is to decide on the number and placement of control entities. An important parameter to consider while doing so is the propagation delay between the controllers and the network devices,[31] especially in the context of large networks. Other objectives that have been considered involve control path reliability,[32] fault tolerance,[33] and application requirements.[34]
