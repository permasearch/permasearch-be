Jill informs Nancy she wants custody of Stevie. Nancy and Silas fly to California to attend a custody hearing, only to find it has been postponed by Jill's lawyer. Nancy drives to Jill's house to visit Stevie, but is refused. Nancy strikes a deal with Scott, Jill's husband, to allow her to use a webcam to see Stevie in secret. Meanwhile, Silas attempts to negotiate with the judge handling the custody case to have the hearing resumed. The judge agrees to meet with Nancy in his chambers and advises her to "return to those who helped you succeed... Be the Nancy that raised Silas."
