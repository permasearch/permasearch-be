Though stereotyped in Europe and North America as nomads, most Berbers were in fact traditionally farmers,[citation needed] living in mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers, such as the Siwa of Egypt; but the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara were almost wholly nomadic. Some groups, such as the Chaouis, practiced transhumance.
