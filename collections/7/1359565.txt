The show had been sold to the network using the pitch "hip parents, square kids."[6] Originally, Elyse and Steven were intended to be the main characters. However, the audience reacted so positively to Alex during the taping of the fourth episode that he became the focus on the show.[3][6] Fox had received the role after Matthew Broderick turned it down.[7]
