In Cape Town, South Africa, there was a daily two-minute silence, known as the Two Minute Pause and later the Remembrance Day silence, initiated by the daily firing of the noon day gun on Signal Hill. This was instituted by the Cape Town Mayor, Sir Harry Hands, on May 14, 1918: one minute was a time of thanksgiving for those who had returned alive, the second minute was to remember the fallen. During the silence a bugler played the Last Post and then Reveille to signal the end of the silence. A Reuters correspondent in Cape Town cabled a description of the event to London and from there word spread to Canada and Australia.[5]
