C-Series pickups included two-wheel drive and featured an independent front suspension (IFS) system with contoured lower control "A" arms and coil springs. GM's new Load Control rear suspension system took up residence in the back. The Load Control rear suspension system consisted of a rear live axle with dual stage Vari-Rate multi-leaf springs and asymmetrical (offset) shock absorber geometry, to help sort out any "wheel hop" under heavy loads or hard acceleration.[22]
