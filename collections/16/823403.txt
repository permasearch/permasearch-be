The title sequence consists of a three-dimensional map of the world, with the continents of Westeros and Essos located on the inner surface of a sphere. The maps used are those of Westeros and Essos that precede the novels in the book series.[4] At the center of the sphere is a Copernican (heliocentric) armillary sphere (spherical astrolabe). The details of the title sequence change each week depending on the locations visited, and new locations may be added in each season.
