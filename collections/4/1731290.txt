Specifically, Wells' book is considered to have been influenced by M. P. Shiel's best-selling The Yellow Danger,[8] which also influenced Jack London's The Unparalleled Invasion (1910).[9] A bit of scepticism on this issue is retained in The War in the Air in a passage where a German officer, hearing of the massive Asiatic offensive, remarks with astonishment: "The Yellow Peril was a peril, after all!".[10]
