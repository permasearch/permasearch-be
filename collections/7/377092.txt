In season two, Roy often goes out to clean up the streets, until the Arrow convinces him to gather intelligence instead. After being injected with Mirakuru, Roy gains super strength but slowly loses his sanity. The Arrow reveals his identity when Oliver convinces Roy to stop Bronze Tiger. Roy trains with Oliver in order to control his strength, but is forced to break up with Thea. Slade kidnaps Roy to use his blood to create his army, leaving Roy completely insane and causing him to go on a rampage, killing a cop. Roy takes part in the season finale's battle, with his own mask, but he is slightly amnesiac, not remembering anything after breaking up with Thea.
