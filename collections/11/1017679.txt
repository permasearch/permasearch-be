The rivalry extends beyond sports to the annual blood drive between the two schools. Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 31st annual blood drive in 2015, resulting in the eighth consecutive win for USC. Carolina now holds a 18-15 lead in the yearly competition.
