Without further specification, the roots of unity are complex numbers, and subsequent sections of this article will comply with this. However the defining equation of roots of unity is meaningful over any field (and even over any unital ring) F, and this allows considering roots of unity in F. Whichever is the field F, the roots of unity in F are either complex numbers, if the characteristic of F is 0, or, otherwise, belong to a finite field. Conversely, every nonzero element in a finite field is a root of unity in that field. See Root of unity modulo n and Finite field for further details.
