The story the novel covers would amount to the second act of the film. Anderson added new scenes to serve for the film's beginning and end.[7] The new scenes precede Mr. Fox's plan to steal from the three farmers and follow the farmers' bulldozing of the hill, beginning with the flooding of the tunnel. Selick left the project, to work on the Neil Gaiman story Coraline in February 2006.[8] He was replaced by Mark Gustafson.[9] 20th Century Fox became the project's home in October 2006 after Revolution folded.[10]
